FROM "THE JOURNAL OF OCCULTISM"
MID-JANUARY, 1907.


A strange story comes from the Adriatic.  It appears that on the night of
the 9th, as the Italia Steamship Company's vessel "Victorine" was passing
a little before midnight the point known as "the Spear of Ivan," on the
coast of the Blue Mountains, the attention of the Captain, then on the
bridge, was called by the look-out man to a tiny floating light close
inshore.  It is the custom of some South-going ships to run close to the
Spear of Ivan in fine weather, as the water is deep, and there is no
settled current; also there are no outlying rocks.  Indeed, some years
ago the local steamers had become accustomed to hug the shore here so
closely that an intimation was sent from Lloyd's that any mischance under
the circumstances would not be included in ordinary sea risks.  Captain
Mirolani is one of those who insist on a wholesome distance from the
promontory being kept; but on his attention having been called to the
circumstance reported, he thought it well to investigate it, as it might
be some case of personal distress.  Accordingly, he had the engines
slowed down, and edged cautiously in towards shore.  He was joined on the
bridge by two of his officers, Signori Falamano and Destilia, and by one
passenger on board, Mr. Peter Caulfield, whose reports of Spiritual
Phenomena in remote places are well known to the readers of "The Journal
of Occultism."  The following account of the strange occurrence written
by him, and attested by the signatures of Captain Mirolani and the other
gentleman named, has been sent to us.

" . . . It was eleven minutes before twelve midnight on Saturday, the 9th
day of January, 1907, when I saw the strange sight off the headland known
as the Spear of Ivan on the coast of the Land of the Blue Mountains.  It
was a fine night, and I stood right on the bows of the ship, where there
was nothing to obstruct my view.  We were some distance from the Spear of
Ivan, passing from northern to southern point of the wide bay into which
it projects.  Captain Mirolani, the Master, is a very careful seaman, and
gives on his journeys a wide berth to the bay which is tabooed by
Lloyd's.  But when he saw in the moonlight, though far off, a tiny white
figure of a woman drifting on some strange current in a small boat, on
the prow of which rested a faint light (to me it looked like a
corpse-candle!), he thought it might be some person in distress, and
began to cautiously edge towards it.  Two of his officers were with him
on the bridge--Signori Falamano and Destilia.  All these three, as well
as myself, saw It.  The rest of the crew and passengers were below.  As
we got close the true inwardness of It became apparent to me; but the
mariners did not seem to realize till the very last.  This is, after all,
not strange, for none of them had either knowledge or experience in
Occult matters, whereas for over thirty years I have made a special study
of this subject, and have gone to and fro over the earth investigating to
the nth all records of Spiritual Phenomena.  As I could see from their
movements that the officers did not comprehend that which was so apparent
to myself, I took care not to enlighten them, lest such should result in
the changing of the vessel's course before I should be near enough to
make accurate observation.  All turned out as I wished--at least, nearly
so--as shall be seen.  Being in the bow, I had, of course, a better view
than from the bridge.   Presently I made out that the boat, which had all
along seemed to be of a queer shape, was none other than a _Coffin_, and
that the woman standing up in it was clothed in a shroud.  Her back was
towards us, and she had evidently not heard our approach.  As we were
creeping along slowly, the engines were almost noiseless, and there was
hardly a ripple as our fore-foot cut the dark water.  Suddenly there was
a wild cry from the bridge--Italians are certainly very excitable; hoarse
commands were given to the Quartermaster at the wheel; the engine-room
bell clanged.  On the instant, as it seemed, the ship's head began to
swing round to starboard; full steam ahead was in action, and before one
could understand, the Apparition was fading in the distance.  The last
thing I saw was the flash of a white face with dark, burning eyes as the
figure sank down into the coffin--just as mist or smoke disappears under
a breeze."




BOOK I: THE WILL OF ROGER MELTON


The Reading of the Will of Roger Melton and all that Followed


Record made by Ernest Roger Halbard Melton, law-student of the Inner
Temple, eldest son of Ernest Halbard Melton, eldest son of Ernest Melton,
elder brother of the said Roger Melton and his next of kin.

I consider it at least useful--perhaps necessary--to have a complete and
accurate record of all pertaining to the Will of my late grand-uncle
Roger Melton.

To which end let me put down the various members of his family, and
explain some of their occupations and idiosyncrasies.  My father, Ernest
Halbard Melton, was the only son of Ernest Melton, eldest son of Sir
Geoffrey Halbard Melton of Humcroft, in the shire of Salop, a Justice of
the Peace, and at one time Sheriff.  My great-grandfather, Sir Geoffrey,
had inherited a small estate from his father, Roger Melton.  In his time,
by the way, the name was spelled Milton; but my great-great-grandfather
changed the spelling to the later form, as he was a practical man not
given to sentiment, and feared lest he should in the public eye be
confused with others belonging to the family of a Radical person called
Milton, who wrote poetry and was some sort of official in the time of
Cromwell, whilst we are Conservatives.  The same practical spirit which
originated the change in the spelling of the family name inclined him to
go into business.  So he became, whilst still young, a tanner and
leather-dresser.  He utilized for the purpose the ponds and streams, and
also the oak-woods on his estate--Torraby in Suffolk.  He made a fine
business, and accumulated a considerable fortune, with a part of which he
purchased the Shropshire estate, which he entailed, and to which I am
therefore heir-apparent.

Sir Geoffrey had, in addition to my grandfather, three sons and a
daughter, the latter being born twenty years after her youngest brother.
These sons were: Geoffrey, who died without issue, having been killed in
the Indian Mutiny at Meerut in 1857, at which he took up a sword, though
a civilian, to fight for his life; Roger (to whom I shall refer
presently); and John--the latter, like Geoffrey, dying unmarried.  Out of
Sir Geoffrey's family of five, therefore, only three have to be
considered: My grandfather, who had three children, two of whom, a son
and a daughter, died young, leaving only my father, Roger and Patience.
Patience, who was born in 1858, married an Irishman of the name of
Sellenger--which was the usual way of pronouncing the name of St. Leger,
or, as they spelled it, Sent Leger--restored by later generations to the
still older form.  He was a reckless, dare-devil sort of fellow, then a
Captain in the Lancers, a man not without the quality of bravery--he won
the Victoria Cross at the Battle of Amoaful in the Ashantee Campaign.
But I fear he lacked the seriousness and steadfast strenuous purpose
which my father always says marks the character of our own family.  He
ran through nearly all of his patrimony--never a very large one; and had
it not been for my grand-aunt's little fortune, his days, had he lived,
must have ended in comparative poverty.  Comparative, not actual; for the
Meltons, who are persons of considerable pride, would not have tolerated
a poverty-stricken branch of the family.  We don't think much of that
lot--any of us.

Fortunately, my great-aunt Patience had only one child, and the premature
decease of Captain St. Leger (as I prefer to call the name) did not allow
of the possibility of her having more.  She did not marry again, though
my grandmother tried several times to arrange an alliance for her.  She
was, I am told, always a stiff, uppish person, who would not yield
herself to the wisdom of her superiors.  Her own child was a son, who
seemed to take his character rather from his father's family than from my
own.  He was a wastrel and a rolling stone, always in scrapes at school,
and always wanting to do ridiculous things.  My father, as Head of the
House and his own senior by eighteen years, tried often to admonish him;
but his perversity of spirit and his truculence were such that he had to
desist.  Indeed, I have heard my father say that he sometimes threatened
his life.  A desperate character he was, and almost devoid of reverence.
No one, not even my father, had any influence--good influence, of course,
I mean--over him, except his mother, who was of my family; and also a
woman who lived with her--a sort of governess--aunt, he called her.  The
way of it was this: Captain St. Leger had a younger brother, who made an
improvident marriage with a Scotch girl when they were both very young.
They had nothing to live on except what the reckless Lancer gave them,
for he had next to nothing himself, and she was "bare"--which is, I
understand, the indelicate Scottish way of expressing lack of fortune.
She was, however, I understand, of an old and somewhat good family,
though broken in fortune--to use an expression which, however, could
hardly be used precisely in regard to a family or a person who never had
fortune to be broken in!  It was so far well that the MacKelpies--that
was the maiden name of Mrs. St. Leger--were reputable--so far as fighting
was concerned.  It would have been too humiliating to have allied to our
family, even on the distaff side, a family both poor and of no account.
Fighting alone does not make a family, I think.  Soldiers are not
everything, though they think they are.  We have had in our family men
who fought; but I never heard of any of them who fought because they
_wanted_ to.  Mrs. St. Leger had a sister; fortunately there were only
those two children in the family, or else they would all have had to be
supported by the money of my family.

Mr. St. Leger, who was only a subaltern, was killed at Maiwand; and his
wife was left a beggar.  Fortunately, however, she died--her sister
spread a story that it was from the shock and grief--before the child
which she expected was born.  This all happened when my cousin--or,
rather, my father's cousin, my first-cousin-once-removed, to be
accurate--was still a very small child.  His mother then sent for Miss
MacKelpie, her brother-in-law's sister-in-law, to come and live with her,
which she did--beggars can't be choosers; and she helped to bring up
young St. Leger.

I remember once my father giving me a sovereign for making a witty remark
about her.  I was quite a boy then, not more than thirteen; but our
family were always clever from the very beginning of life, and father was
telling me about the St. Leger family.  My family hadn't, of course, seen
anything of them since Captain St. Leger died--the circle to which we
belong don't care for poor relations--and was explaining where Miss
MacKelpie came in.  She must have been a sort of nursery governess, for
Mrs. St. Leger once told him that she helped her to educate the child.

"Then, father," I said, "if she helped to educate the child she ought to
have been called Miss MacSkelpie!"

When my first-cousin-once-removed, Rupert, was twelve years old, his
mother died, and he was in the dolefuls about it for more than a year.
Miss MacKelpie kept on living with him all the same.  Catch her quitting!
That sort don't go into the poor-house when they can keep out!  My
father, being Head of the Family, was, of course, one of the trustees,
and his uncle Roger, brother of the testator, another.  The third was
General MacKelpie, a poverty-stricken Scotch laird who had a lot of
valueless land at Croom, in Ross-shire.  I remember father gave me a new
ten-pound note when I interrupted him whilst he was telling me of the
incident of young St. Leger's improvidence by remarking that he was in
error as to the land.  From what I had heard of MacKelpie's estate, it
was productive of one thing; when he asked me "What?" I answered
"Mortgages!"  Father, I knew, had bought, not long before, a lot of them
at what a college friend of mine from Chicago used to call "cut-throat"
price.  When I remonstrated with my father for buying them at all, and so
injuring the family estate which I was to inherit, he gave me an answer,
the astuteness of which I have never forgotten.

"I did it so that I might keep my hand on the bold General, in case he
should ever prove troublesome.  And if the worst should ever come to the
worst, Croom is a good country for grouse and stags!"  My father can see
as far as most men!

When my cousin--I shall call him cousin henceforth in this record, lest
it might seem to any unkind person who might hereafter read it that I
wished to taunt Rupert St. Leger with his somewhat obscure position, in
reiterating his real distance in kinship with my family--when my cousin,
Rupert St. Leger, wished to commit a certain idiotic act of financial
folly, he approached my father on the subject, arriving at our estate,
Humcroft, at an inconvenient time, without permission, not having had
even the decent courtesy to say he was coming.  I was then a little chap
of six years old, but I could not help noticing his mean appearance.  He
was all dusty and dishevelled.  When my father saw him--I came into the
study with him--he said in a horrified voice:

"Good God!"  He was further shocked when the boy brusquely acknowledged,
in reply to my father's greeting, that he had travelled third class.  Of
course, none of my family ever go anything but first class; even the
servants go second.  My father was really angry when he said he had
walked up from the station.

"A nice spectacle for my tenants and my tradesmen!  To see my--my--a
kinsman of my house, howsoever remote, trudging like a tramp on the road
to my estate!  Why, my avenue is two miles and a perch!  No wonder you
are filthy and insolent!"  Rupert--really, I cannot call him cousin
here--was exceedingly impertinent to my father.

"I walked, sir, because I had no money; but I assure you I did not mean
to be insolent.  I simply came here because I wished to ask your advice
and assistance, not because you are an important person, and have a long
avenue--as I know to my cost--but simply because you are one of my
trustees."

"_Your_ trustees, sirrah!" said my father, interrupting him.  "Your
trustees?"

"I beg your pardon, sir," he said, quite quietly.  "I meant the trustees
of my dear mother's will."

"And what, may I ask you," said father, "do you want in the way of advice
from one of the trustees of your dear mother's will?"  Rupert got very
red, and was going to say something rude--I knew it from his look--but he
stopped, and said in the same gentle way:

"I want your advice, sir, as to the best way of doing something which I
wish to do, and, as I am under age, cannot do myself.  It must be done
through the trustees of my mother's will."

"And the assistance for which you wish?" said father, putting his hand in
his pocket.  I know what that action means when I am talking to him.

"The assistance I want," said Rupert, getting redder than ever, "is from
my--the trustee also.  To carry out what I want to do."

"And what may that be?" asked my father.  "I would like, sir, to make
over to my Aunt Janet--"  My father interrupted him by asking--he had
evidently remembered my jest:

"Miss MacSkelpie?"  Rupert got still redder, and I turned away; I didn't
quite wish that he should see me laughing.  He went on quietly:

"_MacKelpie_, sir!  Miss Janet MacKelpie, my aunt, who has always been so
kind to me, and whom my mother loved--I want to have made over to her the
money which my dear mother left to me."  Father doubtless wished to have
the matter take a less serious turn, for Rupert's eyes were all shiny
with tears which had not fallen; so after a little pause he said, with
indignation, which I knew was simulated:

"Have you forgotten your mother so soon, Rupert, that you wish to give
away the very last gift which she bestowed on you?"  Rupert was sitting,
but he jumped up and stood opposite my father with his fist clenched.  He
was quite pale now, and his eyes looked so fierce that I thought he would
do my father an injury.  He spoke in a voice which did not seem like his
own, it was so strong and deep.

"Sir!" he roared out.  I suppose, if I was a writer, which, thank God, I
am not--I have no need to follow a menial occupation--I would call it
"thundered."  "Thundered" is a longer word than "roared," and would, of
course, help to gain the penny which a writer gets for a line.  Father
got pale too, and stood quite still.  Rupert looked at him steadily for
quite half a minute--it seemed longer at the time--and suddenly smiled
and said, as he sat down again:

"Sorry.  But, of course, you don't understand such things."  Then he went
on talking before father had time to say a word.

"Let us get back to business.  As you do not seem to follow me, let me
explain that it is _because_ I do not forget that I wish to do this.  I
remember my dear mother's wish to make Aunt Janet happy, and would like
to do as she did."

"_Aunt_ Janet?" said father, very properly sneering at his ignorance.
"She is not your aunt.  Why, even her sister, who was married to your
uncle, was only your aunt by courtesy."  I could not help feeling that
Rupert meant to be rude to my father, though his words were quite polite.
If I had been as much bigger than him as he was than me, I should have
flown at him; but he was a very big boy for his age.  I am myself rather
thin.  Mother says thinness is an "appanage of birth."

"My Aunt Janet, sir, is an aunt by love.  Courtesy is a small word to use
in connection with such devotion as she has given to us.  But I needn't
trouble you with such things, sir.  I take it that my relations on the
side of my own house do not affect you.  I am a Sent Leger!"  Father
looked quite taken aback.  He sat quite still before he spoke.

"Well, Mr. St. Leger, I shall think over the matter for a while, and
shall presently let you know my decision.  In the meantime, would you
like something to eat?  I take it that as you must have started very
early, you have not had any breakfast?"  Rupert smiled quite genially:

"That is true, sir.  I haven't broken bread since dinner last night, and
I am ravenously hungry."  Father rang the bell, and told the footman who
answered it to send the housekeeper.  When she came, father said to her:

"Mrs. Martindale, take this boy to your room and give him some
breakfast."  Rupert stood very still for some seconds.  His face had got
red again after his paleness.  Then he bowed to my father, and followed
Mrs. Martindale, who had moved to the door.

Nearly an hour afterwards my father sent a servant to tell him to come to
the study.  My mother was there, too, and I had gone back with her.  The
man came back and said:

"Mrs. Martindale, sir, wishes to know, with her respectful service, if
she may have a word with you."  Before father could reply mother told him
to bring her.  The housekeeper could not have been far off--that kind are
generally near a keyhole--for she came at once.  When she came in, she
stood at the door curtseying and looking pale.  Father said:

"Well?"

"I thought, sir and ma'am, that I had better come and tell you about
Master Sent Leger.  I would have come at once, but I feared to disturb
you."

"Well?"  Father had a stern way with servants.  When I'm head of the
family I'll tread them under my feet.  That's the way to get real
devotion from servants!

"If you please, sir, I took the young gentleman into my room and ordered
a nice breakfast for him, for I could see he was half famished--a growing
boy like him, and so tall!  Presently it came along.  It was a good
breakfast, too!  The very smell of it made even me hungry.  There were
eggs and frizzled ham, and grilled kidneys, and coffee, and buttered
toast, and bloater-paste--"

"That will do as to the menu," said mother.  "Go on!"

"When it was all ready, and the maid had gone, I put a chair to the table
and said, 'Now, sir, your breakfast is ready!'  He stood up and said,
'Thank you, madam; you are very kind!' and he bowed to me quite nicely,
just as if I was a lady, ma'am!"

"Go on," said mother.

"Then, sir, he held out his hand and said, 'Good-bye, and thank you,' and
he took up his cap.

"'But aren't you going to have any breakfast, sir?' I says.

"'No, thank you, madam,' he said; 'I couldn't eat here . . . in this
house, I mean!'  Well, ma'am, he looked so lonely that I felt my heart
melting, and I ventured to ask him if there was any mortal thing I could
do for him.  'Do tell me, dear,' I ventured to say.  'I am an old woman,
and you, sir, are only a boy, though it's a fine man you will be--like
your dear, splendid father, which I remember so well, and gentle like
your poor dear mother.'

"'You're a dear!' he says; and with that I took up his hand and kissed
it, for I remember his poor dear mother so well, that was dead only a
year.  Well, with that he turned his head away, and when I took him by
the shoulders and turned him round--he is only a young boy, ma'am, for
all he is so big--I saw that the tears were rolling down his cheeks.
With that I laid his head on my breast--I've had children of my own,
ma'am, as you know, though they're all gone.  He came willing enough, and
sobbed for a little bit.  Then he straightened himself up, and I stood
respectfully beside him.

"'Tell Mr. Melton,' he said, 'that I shall not trouble him about the
trustee business.'

"'But won't you tell him yourself, sir, when you see him?' I says.

"'I shall not see him again,' he says; 'I am going back now!'

"Well, ma'am, I knew he'd had no breakfast, though he was hungry, and
that he would walk as he come, so I ventured to say: 'If you won't take
it a liberty, sir, may I do anything to make your going easier?  Have you
sufficient money, sir?  If not, may I give, or lend, you some?  I shall
be very proud if you will allow me to.'

"'Yes,' he says quite hearty.  'If you will, you might lend me a
shilling, as I have no money.  I shall not forget it.'  He said, as he
took the coin: 'I shall return the amount, though I never can the
kindness.  I shall keep the coin.'  He took the shilling, sir--he
wouldn't take any more--and then he said good-bye.  At the door he turned
and walked back to me, and put his arms round me like a real boy does,
and gave me a hug, and says he:

"'Thank you a thousand times, Mrs. Martindale, for your goodness to me,
for your sympathy, and for the way you have spoken of my father and
mother.  You have seen me cry, Mrs. Martindale,' he said; 'I don't often
cry: the last time was when I came back to the lonely house after my poor
dear was laid to rest.  But you nor any other shall ever see a tear of
mine again.'  And with that he straightened out his big back and held up
his fine proud head, and walked out.  I saw him from the window striding
down the avenue.  My! but he is a proud boy, sir--an honour to your
family, sir, say I respectfully.  And there, the proud child has gone
away hungry, and he won't, I know, ever use that shilling to buy food!"

Father was not going to have that, you know, so he said to her:

"He does not belong to my family, I would have you to know.  True, he is
allied to us through the female side; but we do not count him or his in
my family."  He turned away and began to read a book.  It was a decided
snub to her.

But mother had a word to say before Mrs. Martindale was done with.
Mother has a pride of her own, and doesn't brook insolence from
inferiors; and the housekeeper's conduct seemed to be rather presuming.
Mother, of course, isn't quite our class, though her folk are quite
worthy and enormously rich.  She is one of the Dalmallingtons, the salt
people, one of whom got a peerage when the Conservatives went out.  She
said to the housekeeper:

"I think, Mrs. Martindale, that I shall not require your services after
this day month!  And as I don't keep servants in my employment when I
dismiss them, here is your month's wages due on the 25th of this month,
and another month in lieu of notice.  Sign this receipt."  She was
writing a receipt as she spoke.  The other signed it without a word, and
handed it to her.  She seemed quite flabbergasted.  Mother got up and
sailed--that is the way that mother moves when she is in a wax--out of
the room.

Lest I should forget it, let me say here that the dismissed housekeeper
was engaged the very next day by the Countess of Salop.  I may say in
explanation that the Earl of Salop, K.G., who is Lord-Lieutenant of the
County, is jealous of father's position and his growing influence.
Father is going to contest the next election on the Conservative side,
and is sure to be made a Baronet before long.

    MY DEAR GODSON,

    I am truly sorry I am unable to agree with your request that I should
    acquiesce in your desire to transfer to Miss Janet MacKelpie the
    property bequeathed to you by your mother, of which property I am a
    trustee.  Let me say at once that, had it been possible to me to do
    so, I should have held it a privilege to further such a wish--not
    because the beneficiare whom you would create is a near kinswoman of
    my own.  That, in truth, is my real difficulty.  I have undertaken a
    trust made by an honourable lady on behalf of her only son--son of a
    man of stainless honour, and a dear friend of my own, and whose son
    has a rich heritage of honour from both parents, and who will, I am
    sure, like to look back on his whole life as worthy of his parents,
    and of those whom his parents trusted.  You will see, I am sure, that
    whatsoever I might grant regarding anyone else, my hands are tied in
    this matter.

    And now let me say, my dear boy, that your letter has given me the
    most intense pleasure.  It is an unspeakable delight to me to find in
    the son of your father--a man whom I loved, and a boy whom I
    love--the same generosity of spirit which endeared your father to all
    his comrades, old as well as young.  Come what may, I shall always be
    proud of you; and if the sword of an old soldier--it is all I
    have--can ever serve you in any way, it and its master's life are,
    and shall be, whilst life remains to him, yours.

    It grieves me to think that Janet cannot, through my act, be given
    that ease and tranquillity of spirit which come from competence.
    But, my dear Rupert, you will be of full age in seven years more.
    Then, if you are in the same mind--and I am sure you will not
    change--you, being your own master, can do freely as you will.  In
    the meantime, to secure, so far as I can, my dear Janet against any
    malign stroke of fortune, I have given orders to my factor to remit
    semi-annually to Janet one full half of such income as may be derived
    in any form from my estate of Croom.  It is, I am sorry to say,
    heavily mortgaged; but of such as is--or may be, free from such
    charge as the mortgage entails--something at least will, I trust,
    remain to her.  And, my dear boy, I can frankly say that it is to me
    a real pleasure that you and I can be linked in one more bond in this
    association of purpose.  I have always held you in my heart as though
    you were my own son.  Let me tell you now that you have acted as I
    should have liked a son of my own, had I been blessed with one, to
    have acted.  God bless you, my dear.

                                                               Yours ever,
                                                    COLIN ALEX. MACKELPIE.

    MY DEAR NEPHEW,

    Your letter of the 30th ult. received.  Have carefully considered
    matter stated, and have come to the conclusion that my duty as a
    trustee would not allow me to give full consent, as you wish.  Let me
    explain.  The testator, in making her will, intended that such
    fortune as she had at disposal should be used to supply to you her
    son such benefits as its annual product should procure.  To this end,
    and to provide against wastefulness or foolishness on your part, or,
    indeed, against any generosity, howsoever worthy, which might
    impoverish you and so defeat her benevolent intentions regarding your
    education, comfort, and future good, she did not place the estate
    directly in your hands, leaving you to do as you might feel inclined
    about it.  But, on the contrary, she entrusted the corpus of it in
    the hands of men whom she believed should be resolute enough and
    strong enough to carry out her intent, even against any cajolements
    or pressure which might be employed to the contrary.  It being her
    intention, then, that such trustees as she appointed would use for
    your benefit the interest accruing annually from the capital at
    command, _and that only_ (as specifically directed in the will), so
    that on your arriving at full age the capital entrusted to us should
    be handed over to you intact, I find a hard-and-fast duty in the
    matter of adhering exactly to the directions given.  I have no doubt
    that my co-trustees regard the matter in exactly the same light.
    Under the circumstances, therefore, we, the trustees, have not only a
    single and united duty towards you as the object of the testator's
    wishes, but towards each other as regards the manner of the carrying
    out of that duty.  I take it, therefore, that it would not be
    consonant with the spirit of the trust or of our own ideas in
    accepting it that any of us should take a course pleasant to himself
    which would or might involve a stern opposition on the part of other
    of the co-trustees.  We have each of us to do the unpleasant part of
    this duty without fear or favour.  You understand, of course, that
    the time which must elapse before you come into absolute possession
    of your estate is a limited one.  As by the terms of the will we are
    to hand over our trust when you have reached the age of twenty-one,
    there are only seven years to expire.  But till then, though I should
    gladly meet your wishes if I could, I must adhere to the duty which I
    have undertaken.  At the expiration of that period you will be quite
    free to divest yourself of your estate without protest or comment of
    any man.

    Having now expressed as clearly as I can the limitations by which I
    am bound with regard to the corpus of your estate, let me say that in
    any other way which is in my power or discretion I shall be most
    happy to see your wishes carried out so far as rests with me.
    Indeed, I shall undertake to use what influence I may possess with my
    co-trustees to induce them to take a similar view of your wishes.  In
    my own thinking you are quite free to use your own property in your
    own way.  But as, until you shall have attained your majority, you
    have only life-user in your mother's bequest, you are only at liberty
    to deal with the annual increment.  On our part as trustees we have a
    first charge on that increment to be used for purposes of your
    maintenance, clothes, and education.  As to what may remain over each
    half-year, you will be free to deal with it as you choose.  On
    receiving from you a written authorization to your trustees, if you
    desire the whole sum or any part of it to be paid over to Miss Janet
    MacKelpie, I shall see that it is effected.  Believe me, that our
    duty is to protect the corpus of the estate, and to this end we may
    not act on any instruction to imperil it.  But there our warranty
    stops.  We can deal during our trusteeship with the corpus only.
    Further, lest there should arise any error on your part, we can deal
    with any general instruction for only so long as it may remain
    unrevoked.  You are, and must be, free to alter your instructions or
    authorizations at any time.  Thus your latest document must be used
    for our guidance.

    As to the general principle involved in your wish I make no comment.
    You are at liberty to deal with your own how you will.  I quite
    understand that your impulse is a generous one, and I fully believe
    that it is in consonance with what had always been the wishes of my
    sister.  Had she been happily alive and had to give judgment of your
    intent, I am convinced that she would have approved.  Therefore, my
    dear nephew, should you so wish, I shall be happy for her sake as
    well as your own to pay over on your account (as a confidential
    matter between you and me), but from my own pocket, a sum equal to
    that which you wish transferred to Miss Janet MacKelpie.  On hearing
    from you I shall know how to act in the matter.  With all good
    wishes,

                                                         Believe me to be,
                                                  Your affectionate uncle,
                                                             ROGER MELTON.

    TO RUPERT SENT LEGER, ESQ.

_Letter from Rupert Sent Leger to Roger Melton_,

                                                           _July_ 5, 1892.

    MY DEAR UNCLE,

    Thank you heartily for your kind letter.  I quite understand, and now
    see that I should not have asked you as a trustee, such a thing.  I
    see your duty clearly, and agree with your view of it.  I enclose a
    letter directed to my trustees, asking them to pay over annually till
    further direction to Miss Janet MacKelpie at this address whatever
    sum may remain over from the interest of my mother's bequest after
    deduction of such expenses as you may deem fit for my maintenance,
    clothing, and education, together with a sum of one pound sterling
    per month, which was the amount my dear mother always gave me for my
    personal use--"pocket-money," she called it.

    With regard to your most kind and generous offer to give to my dear
    Aunt Janet the sum which I would have given myself, had such been in
    my power, I thank you most truly and sincerely, both for my dear aunt
    (to whom, of course, I shall not mention the matter unless you
    specially authorize me) and myself.  But, indeed, I think it will be
    better not to offer it.  Aunt Janet is very proud, and would not
    accept any benefit.  With me, of course, it is different, for since I
    was a wee child she has been like another mother to me, and I love
    her very much.  Since my mother died--and she, of course, was
    all-in-all to me--there has been no other.  And in such a love as
    ours pride has no place.  Thank you again, dear uncle, and God bless
    you.

                                                       Your loving nephew,
                                                        RUPERT SENT LEGER.



ERNEST ROGER HALBARD MELTON'S RECORD--_Continued_.


And now _re_ the remaining one of Sir Geoffrey's children, Roger.  He was
the third child and third son, the only daughter, Patience, having been
born twenty years after the last of the four sons.  Concerning Roger, I
shall put down all I have heard of him from my father and grandfather.
From my grand-aunt I heard nothing, I was a very small kid when she died;
but I remember seeing her, but only once.  A very tall, handsome woman of
a little over thirty, with very dark hair and light-coloured eyes.  I
think they were either grey or blue, but I can't remember which.  She
looked very proud and haughty, but I am bound to say that she was very
nice to me.  I remember feeling very jealous of Rupert because his mother
looked so distinguished.  Rupert was eight years older than me, and I was
afraid he would beat me if I said anything he did not like.  So I was
silent except when I forgot to be, and Rupert said very unkindly, and I
think very unfairly, that I was "A sulky little beast."  I haven't forgot
that, and I don't mean to.  However, it doesn't matter much what he said
or thought.  There he is--if he is at all--where no one can find him,
with no money or nothing, for what little he had he settled when he came
of age, on the MacSkelpie.  He wanted to give it to her when his mother
died, but father, who was a trustee, refused; and Uncle Roger, as I call
him, who is another, thought the trustees had no power to allow Rupert to
throw away his matrimony, as I called it, making a joke to father when he
called it patrimony.  Old Sir Colin MacSkelpie, who is the third, said he
couldn't take any part in such a permission, as the MacSkelpie was his
niece.  He is a rude old man, that.  I remember when, not remembering his
relationship, I spoke of the MacSkelpie, he caught me a clip on the ear
that sent me across the room.  His Scotch is very broad.  I can hear him
say, "Hae some attempt at even Soothern manners, and dinna misca' yer
betters, ye young puddock, or I'll wring yer snoot!"  Father was, I could
see, very much offended, but he didn't say anything.  He remembered, I
think, that the General is a V.C. man, and was fond of fighting duels.
But to show that the fault was not his, _he_ wrung _my_ ear--and the same
ear too!  I suppose he thought that was justice!  But it's only right to
say that he made up for it afterwards.  When the General had gone he gave
me a five-pound note.

I don't think Uncle Roger was very pleased with the way Rupert behaved
about the legacy, for I don't think he ever saw him from that day to
this.  Perhaps, of course, it was because Rupert ran away shortly
afterwards; but I shall tell about that when I come to him.  After all,
why should my uncle bother about him?  He is not a Melton at all, and I
am to be Head of the House--of course, when the Lord thinks right to take
father to Himself!  Uncle Roger has tons of money, and he never married,
so if he wants to leave it in the right direction he needn't have any
trouble.  He made his money in what he calls "the Eastern Trade."  This,
so far as I can gather, takes in the Levant and all east of it.  I know
he has what they call in trade "houses" in all sorts of places--Turkey,
and Greece, and all round them, Morocco, Egypt, and Southern Russia, and
the Holy Land; then on to Persia, India, and all round it; the
Chersonese, China, Japan, and the Pacific Islands.  It is not to be
expected that we landowners can know much about trade, but my uncle
covers--or alas! I must say "covered"--a lot of ground, I can tell you.
Uncle Roger was a very grim sort of man, and only that I was brought up
to try and be kind to him I shouldn't ever have dared to speak to him.
But when was a child father and mother--especially mother--forced me to
go and see him and be affectionate to him.  He wasn't ever even civil to
me, that I can remember--grumpy old bear!  But, then, he never saw Rupert
at all, so that I take it Master R--- is out of the running altogether
for testamentary honours.  The last time I saw him myself he was
distinctly rude.  He treated me as a boy, though I was getting on for
eighteen years of age.  I came into his office without knocking; and
without looking up from his desk, where he was writing, he said: "Get
out!  Why do you venture to disturb me when I'm busy?  Get out, and be
damned to you!"  I waited where I was, ready to transfix him with my eye
when he should look up, for I cannot forget that when my father dies I
shall be Head of my House.  But when he did there was no transfixing
possible.  He said quite coolly:

"Oh, it's you, is it?  I thought it was one of my office boys.  Sit down,
if you want to see me, and wait till I am ready."  So I sat down and
waited.  Father always said that I should try to conciliate and please my
uncle.  Father is a very shrewd man, and Uncle Roger is a very rich one.

But I don't think Uncle R--- is as shrewd as he thinks he is.  He
sometimes makes awful mistakes in business.  For instance, some years ago
he bought an enormous estate on the Adriatic, in the country they call
the "Land of Blue Mountains."  At least, he says he bought it.  He told
father so in confidence.  But he didn't show any title-deeds, and I'm
greatly afraid he was "had."  A bad job for me that he was, for father
believes he paid an enormous sum for it, and as I am his natural heir, it
reduces his available estate to so much less.

And now about Rupert.  As I have said, he ran away when he was about
fourteen, and we did not hear about him for years.  When we--or, rather,
my father--did hear of him, it was no good that he heard.  He had gone as
a cabin-boy on a sailing ship round the Horn.  Then he joined an
exploring party through the centre of Patagonia, and then another up in
Alaska, and a third to the Aleutian Islands.  After that he went through
Central America, and then to Western Africa, the Pacific Islands, India,
and a lot of places.  We all know the wisdom of the adage that "A rolling
stone gathers no moss"; and certainly, if there be any value in moss,
Cousin Rupert will die a poor man.  Indeed, nothing will stand his
idiotic, boastful wastefulness.  Look at the way in which, when he came
of age, he made over all his mother's little fortune to the MacSkelpie! I
am sure that, though Uncle Roger made no comment to my father, who, as
Head of our House, should, of course, have been informed, he was not
pleased.  My mother, who has a good fortune in her own right, and has had
the sense to keep it in her own control--as I am to inherit it, and it is
not in the entail, I am therefore quite impartial--I can approve of her
spirited conduct in the matter.  We never did think much of Rupert,
anyhow; but now, since he is in the way to be a pauper, and therefore a
dangerous nuisance, we look on him as quite an outsider.  We know what he
really is.  For my own part, I loathe and despise him.  Just now we are
irritated with him, for we are all kept on tenterhooks regarding my dear
Uncle Roger's Will.  For Mr. Trent, the attorney who regulated my dear
uncle's affairs and has possession of the Will, says it is necessary to
know where every possible beneficiary is to be found before making the
Will public, so we all have to wait.  It is especially hard on me, who am
the natural heir.  It is very thoughtless indeed of Rupert to keep away
like that.  I wrote to old MacSkelpie about it, but he didn't seem to
understand or to be at all anxious--he is not the heir!  He said that
probably Rupert Sent Leger--he, too, keeps to the old spelling--did not
know of his uncle's death, or he would have taken steps to relieve our
anxiety.  Our anxiety, forsooth!  We are not anxious; we only wish to
_know_.  And if we--and especially me--who have all the annoyance of
thinking of the detestable and unfair death-duties, are anxious, we
should be so.  Well, anyhow, he'll get a properly bitter disappointment
and set down when he does turn up and discovers that he is a pauper
without hope!

                                * * * * *

To-day we (father and I) had letters from Mr. Trent, telling us that the
whereabouts of "Mr. Rupert Sent Leger" had been discovered, and that a
letter disclosing the fact of poor Uncle Roger's death had been sent to
him.  He was at Titicaca when last heard of.  So goodness only knows when
he may get the letter, which "asks him to come home at once, but only
gives to him such information about the Will as has already been given to
every member of the testator's family."  And that is nil.  I dare say we
shall be kept waiting for months before we get hold of the estate which
is ours.  It is too bad!

    DEAR SIR,

    I am glad to be able to inform you that I have just heard by letter
    from Mr. Rupert St. Leger that he intended leaving Rio de Janeiro by
    the S.S. _Amazon_, of the Royal Mail Company, on December 15.  He
    further stated that he would cable just before leaving Rio de
    Janeiro, to say on what day the ship was expected to arrive in
    London.  As all the others possibly interested in the Will of the
    late Roger Melton, and whose names are given to me in his
    instructions regarding the reading of the Will, have been advised,
    and have expressed their intention of being present at that event on
    being apprised of the time and place, I now beg to inform you that by
    cable message received the date scheduled for arrival at the Port of
    London was January 1 prox.  I therefore beg to notify you, subject to
    postponement due to the non-arrival of the _Amazon_, the reading of
    the Will of the late Roger Melton, Esq., will take place in my office
    on Thursday, January 3 prox., at eleven o'clock a.m.

                                             I have the honour to be, sir,
                                                         Yours faithfully,
                                                     EDWARD BINGHAM TRENT.

                                                                    SALOP.

ERNEST ROGER HALBARD MELTON'S RECORD.


                                                        _January_ 4, 1907.

The reading of Uncle Roger's Will is over.  Father got a duplicate of Mr.
Trent's letter to me, and of the cable and two telegrams pasted into this
Record.  We both waited patiently till the third--that is, we did not say
anything.  The only impatient member of our family was my mother.  She
_did_ say things, and if old Trent had been here his ears would have been
red.  She said what ridiculous nonsense it was delaying the reading of
the Will, and keeping the Heir waiting for the arrival of an obscure
person who wasn't even a member of the family, inasmuch as he didn't bear
the name.  I don't think it's quite respectful to one who is some day to
be Head of the House!  I thought father was weakening in his patience
when he said: "True, my dear--true!" and got up and left the room.  Some
time afterwards when I passed the library I heard him walking up and
down.

Father and I went up to town on the afternoon of Wednesday, January 2.
We stayed, of course, at Claridge's, where we always stay when we go to
town.  Mother wanted to come, too, but father thought it better not.  She
would not agree to stay at home till we both promised to send her
separate telegrams after the reading.

At five minutes to eleven we entered Mr. Trent's office.  Father would
not go a moment earlier, as he said it was bad form to seem eager at any
time, but most of all at the reading of a will.  It was a rotten grind,
for we had to be walking all over the neighbourhood for half an hour
before it was time, not to be too early.

When we went into the room we found there General Sir Colin MacKelpie and
a big man, very bronzed, whom I took to be Rupert St. Leger--not a very
creditable connection to look at, I thought!  He and old MacKelpie took
care to be in time!  Rather low, I thought it.  Mr. St. Leger was reading
a letter.  He had evidently come in but lately, for though he seemed to
be eager about it, he was only at the first page, and I could see that
there were many sheets.  He did not look up when we came in, or till he
had finished the letter; and you may be sure that neither I nor my father
(who, as Head of the House, should have had more respect from him) took
the trouble to go to him.  After all, he is a pauper and a wastrel, and
he has not the honour of bearing our Name.  The General, however, came
forward and greeted us both cordially.  He evidently had forgotten--or
pretended to have--the discourteous way he once treated me, for he spoke
to me quite in a friendly way--I thought more warmly than he did to
father.  I was pleased to be spoken to so nicely, for, after all,
whatever his manners may be, he is a distinguished man--has won the V.C.
and a Baronetcy.  He got the latter not long ago, after the Frontier War
in India.  I was not, however, led away into cordiality myself.  I had
not forgotten his rudeness, and I thought that he might be sucking up to
me.  I knew that when I had my dear Uncle Roger's many millions I should
be a rather important person; and, of course, he knew it too.  So I got
even with him for his former impudence.  When he held out his hand I put
one finger in it, and said, "How do?"  He got very red and turned away.
Father and he had ended by glaring at each other, so neither of us was
sorry to be done with him.  All the time Mr. St. Leger did not seem to
see or hear anything, but went on reading his letter.  I thought the old
MacSkelpie was going to bring him into the matter between us, for as he
turned away I heard him say something under his breath.  It sounded like
"Help!" but Mr. S--- did not hear.  He certainly no notice of it.

As the MacS--- and Mr. S--- sat quite silent, neither looking at us, and
as father was sitting on the other side of the room with his chin in his
hand, and as I wanted to show that I was indifferent to the two S's, I
took out this notebook, and went on with the Record, bringing it up to
this moment.



THE RECORD--_Continued_.


When I had finished writing I looked over at Rupert.

When he saw us, he jumped up and went over to father and shook his hand
quite warmly.  Father took him very coolly.  Rupert, however, did not
seem to see it, but came towards me heartily.  I happened to be doing
something else at the moment, and at first I did not see his hand; but
just as I was looking at it the clock struck eleven.  Whilst it was
striking Mr. Trent came into the room.  Close behind him came his clerk,
carrying a locked tin box.  There were two other men also.  He bowed to
us all in turn, beginning with me.  I was standing opposite the door; the
others were scattered about.  Father sat still, but Sir Colin and Mr. St.
Leger rose.  Mr. Trent not did shake hands with any of us--not even me.
Nothing but his respectful bow.  That is the etiquette for an attorney, I
understand, on such formal occasions.

He sat down at the end of the big table in the centre of the room, and
asked us to sit round.  Father, of course, as Head of the Family, took
the seat at his right hand.  Sir Colin and St. Leger went to the other
side, the former taking the seat next to the attorney.  The General
knows, of course, that a Baronet takes precedence at a ceremony.  I may
be a Baronet some day myself, and have to know these things.

The clerk took the key which his master handed to him, opened the tin
box, and took from it a bundle of papers tied with red tape.  This he
placed before the attorney, and put the empty box behind him on the
floor.  Then he and the other man sat at the far end of the table; the
latter took out a big notebook and several pencils, and put them before
him.  He was evidently a shorthand-writer.   Mr. Trent removed the tape
from the bundle of papers, which he placed a little distance in front of
him.  He took a sealed envelope from the top, broke the seal, opened the
envelope, and from it took a parchment, in the folds of which were some
sealed envelopes, which he laid in a heap in front of the other paper.
Then he unfolded the parchment, and laid it before him with the outside
page up.  He fixed his glasses, and said:

"Gentlemen, the sealed envelope which you have seen me open is endorsed
'My Last Will and Testament--ROGER MELTON, _June_, 1906.'  This
document"--holding it up--"is as follows:

    "'I Roger Melton of Openshaw Grange in the County of Dorset; of
    number one hundred and twenty-three Berkeley Square London; and of
    the Castle of Vissarion in the Land of the Blue Mountains, being of
    sound mind do make this my Last Will and Testament on this day Monday
    the eleventh day of the month of June in the year of Our Lord one
    thousand nine hundred and six at the office of my old friend and
    Attorney Edward Bingham Trent in number one hundred and seventy-six
    Lincoln's Inn Fields London hereby revoking all other wills that I
    may have formerly made and giving this as my sole and last Will
    making dispositions of my property as follows:

    "'1.  To my kinsman and nephew Ernest Halbard Melton Esquire, justice
    of the Peace, Humcroft the County of Salop, for his sole use and
    benefit the sum of twenty thousand pounds sterling free of all Duties
    Taxes and charges whatever to be paid out of my Five per centum Bonds
    of the City of Montreal, Canada.

    "'2.  To my respected friend and colleague as co-trustee to the Will
    of my late sister Patience late widow of the late Captain Rupert Sent
    Leger who predeceased her, Major-General Sir Colin Alexander
    MacKelpie, Baronet, holder of the Victoria Cross, Knight Commander of
    the Order of the Bath, of Croom in the county of Ross Scotland a sum
    of Twenty thousand pounds sterling free of all Taxes and charges
    whatsoever; to be paid out of my Five per centum Bonds of the City of
    Toronto, Canada.

    "'3.  To Miss Janet MacKelpie presently residing at Croom in the
    County of Ross Scotland the sum of Twenty thousand pounds sterling
    free of all Duties Taxes and Charges whatsoever, to be paid out of my
    Five per centum Bonds of the London County Council.

    "'4.  To the various persons charities and Trustees named in the
    schedule attached to this Will and marked A. the various sums
    mentioned therein, all free of Duties and Taxes and charges
    whatsoever.'"

Here Mr. Trent read out the list here following, and announced for our
immediate understanding of the situation the total amount as two hundred
and fifty thousand pounds.  Many of the beneficiaries were old friends,
comrades, dependents, and servants, some of them being left quite large
sums of money and specific objects, such as curios and pictures.

    "'5.  To my kinsman and nephew Ernest Roger Halbard Melton presently

    thousand pounds sterling.

    and seventy-six Lincoln's Inn Fields sum of Twenty thousand pounds
    sterling free from all Duties Taxes and Charges whatsoever to be paid
    out of my Five per centum Bonds of the city of Manchester England.

    "'7.  To my dear nephew Rupert Sent Leger only son of my dear sister
    Patience Melton by her marriage with Captain Rupert Sent Leger the
    sum of one thousand pounds sterling.  I also bequeath to the said
    Rupert Sent Leger a further sum conditional upon his acceptance of
    the terms of a letter addressed to him marked B, and left in the
    custody of the above Edward Bingham Trent and which letter is an
    integral part of this my Will.  In case of the non-acceptance of the
    conditions of such letter, I devise and bequeath the whole of the
    sums and properties reserved therein to the executors herein
    appointed Colin Alexander MacKelpie and Edward Bingham Trent in trust
    to distribute the same in accordance with the terms of the letter in
    the present custody of Edward Bingham Trent marked C, and now
    deposited sealed with my seal in the sealed envelope containing my
    last Will to be kept in the custody of the said Edward Bingham Trent
    and which said letter C is also an integral part of my Will.  And in
    case any doubt should arise as to my ultimate intention as to the
    disposal of my property the above-mentioned Executors are to have
    full power to arrange and dispose all such matters as may seem best
    to them without further appeal.  And if any beneficiary under this
    Will shall challenge the same or any part of it, or dispute the
    validity thereof, he shall forfeit to the general estate the bequest
    made herein to him, and any such bequest shall cease and be void to
    all intents and purposes whatsoever.

    "'8.  For proper compliance with laws and duties connected with
    testamentary proceedings and to keep my secret trusts secret I direct
    my Executors to pay all Death, Estate, Settlement, Legacy,
    Succession, or other duties charges impositions and assessments
    whatever on the residue of my estate beyond the bequests already
    named, at the scale charged in the case of most distant relatives or
    strangers in blood.

    "'9.  I hereby appoint as my Executors Major-General Sir Colin
    Alexander MacKelpie, Baronet, of Croom in the County of Ross, and

    their discretion in any circumstance which may arise in the carrying
    out my wishes as expressed in this Will.  As reward for their
    services in this capacity as Executors they are to receive each out
    of the general estate a sum of one hundred thousand pounds sterling

    entrusted by my Will to both.  And if both Executors should die then

    "'JOHN COLSON caretaker of 176 Lincoln's Inn Fields and Verger of St.
    Tabitha's Church Clerkenwell London.'"

When Mr. Trent had finished the reading he put all the papers together,
and tied them up in a bundle again with the red tape.  Holding the bundle
in his hand, he stood up, saying as he did so:

"That is all, gentlemen, unless any of you wish to ask me any questions;
in which case I shall answer, of course, to the best of my power.  I
shall ask you, Sir Colin, to remain with me, as we have to deal with some
matters, or to arrange a time when we may meet to do so.  And you also,
Mr. Sent Leger, as there is this letter to submit to you.  It is
necessary that you should open it in the presence of the executors, but
there is no necessity that anyone else should be present."

The first to speak was my father.  Of course, as a county gentleman of
position and estate, who is sometimes asked to take the chair at
Sessions--of course, when there is not anyone with a title present--he
found himself under the duty of expressing himself first.  Old MacKelpie
has superior rank; but this was a family affair, in which my father is
Head of the House, whilst old MacKelpie is only an outsider brought into
it--and then only to the distaff side, by the wife of a younger brother
of the man who married into our family.  Father spoke with the same look
on his face as when he asks important questions of witnesses at Quarter
Sessions.

"I should like some points elucidated."  The attorney bowed (he gets his
120 thou', any way, so he can afford to be oily--suave, I suppose he
would call it); so father looked at a slip of paper in his hand and
asked:

"How much is the amount of the whole estate?"

The attorney answered quickly, and I thought rather rudely.  He was red
in the face, and didn't bow this time; I suppose a man of his class
hasn't more than a very limited stock of manners:

"That, sir, I am not at liberty to tell you.  And I may say that I would
not if I could."

"Is it a million?" said father again.  He was angry this time, and even
redder than the old attorney.  The attorney said in answer, very quietly
this time:

"Ah, that's cross-examining.  Let me say, sir, that no one can know that
until the accountants to be appointed for the purpose have examined the
affairs of the testator up to date."

Mr. Rupert St. Leger, who was looking all this time angrier than even the
attorney or my father--though at what he had to be angry about I can't
imagine--struck his fist on the table and rose up as if to speak, but as
he caught sight of both old MacKelpie and the attorney he sat down again.
_Mem._--Those three seem to agree too well.  I must keep a sharp eye on
them.  I didn't think of this part any more at the time, for father asked
another question which interested me much:

"May I ask why the other matters of the Will are not shown to us?"  The
attorney wiped his spectacles carefully with a big silk bandanna
handkerchief before he answered:

"Simply because each of the two letters marked 'B' and 'C' is enclosed
with instructions regarding their opening and the keeping secret of their
contents.  I shall call your attention to the fact that both envelopes
are sealed, and that the testator and both witnesses have signed their
names across the flap of each envelope.  I shall read them.  The letter
marked 'B,' directed to 'Rupert Sent Leger,' is thus endorsed:

    "'This letter is to be given to Rupert Sent Leger by the Trustees and
    is to be opened by him in their presence.  He is to take such copy or
    make such notes as he may wish and is then to hand the letter with
    envelope to the Executors who are at once to read it, each of them
    being entitled to make copy or notes if desirous of so doing.  The
    letter is then to be replaced in its envelope and letter and envelope
    are to be placed in another envelope to be endorsed on outside as to
    its contents and to be signed across the flap by both the Executors
    and by the said Rupert Sent Leger.

                                          "'(Signed) ROGER MELTON 1/6/'06.

"The letter marked 'C,' directed to 'Edward Bingham Trent,' is thus
endorsed:

    "'This letter directed to Edward Bingham Trent is to be kept by him
    unopened for a term of two years after the reading of my Last Will
    unless said period is earlier terminated by either the acceptance or
    refusal of Rupert Sent Leger to accept the conditions mentioned in my
    letter to him marked 'B' which he is to receive and read in the
    presence of my Executors at the same meeting as but subsequent to the
    Reading of the clauses (except those to be ultimately numbers ten and
    eleven) of my Last Will.  This letter contains instructions as to
    what both the Executors and the said Rupert Sent Leger are to do when
    such acceptance or refusal of the said Rupert Sent Leger has been
    made known, or if he omit or refuse to make any such acceptance or
    refusal, at the end of two years next after my decease.

    "'(Signed) ROGER MELTON 1/6/'06.'"

When the attorney had finished reading the last letter he put it
carefully in his pocket.  Then he took the other letter in his hand, and
stood up.  "Mr. Rupert Sent Leger," he said, "please to open this letter,
and in such a way that all present may see that the memorandum at top of
the contents is given as--

    "'B.  To be read as clause ten of my Will.'"

St. Leger rolled up his sleeves and cuffs just as if he was going to
perform some sort of prestidigitation--it was very theatrical and
ridiculous--then, his wrists being quite bare, he opened the envelope and
took out the letter.  We all saw it quite well.  It was folded with the
first page outward, and on the top was written a line just as the
attorney said.  In obedience to a request from the attorney, he laid both
letter and envelope on the table in front of him.  The clerk then rose
up, and, after handing a piece of paper to the attorney, went back to his
seat.  Mr. Trent, having written something on the paper, asked us all who
were present, even the clerk and the shorthand man, to look at the
memorandum on the letter and what was written on the envelope, and to
sign the paper, which ran:

"We the signatories of this paper hereby declare that we have seen the
sealed letter marked B and enclosed in the Will of Roger Melton opened in
the presence of us all including Mr. Edward Bingham Trent and Sir Colin
Alexander MacKelpie and we declare that the paper therein contained was
headed 'B.  To be read as clause ten of my Will' and that there were no
other contents in the envelope.  In attestation of which we in the
presence of each other append our signatures."

The attorney motioned to my father to begin.  Father is a cautious man,
and he asked for a magnifying-glass, which was shortly brought to him by
a clerk for whom the clerk in the room called.  Father examined the
envelope all over very carefully, and also the memorandum at top of the
paper.  Then, without a word, he signed the paper.  Father is a just man.
Then we all signed.  The attorney folded the paper and put it in an
envelope.  Before closing it he passed it round, and we all saw that it
had not been tampered with.  Father took it out and read it, and then put
it back.  Then the attorney asked us all to sign it across the flap,
which we did.  Then he put the sealing-wax on it and asked father to seal
it with his own seal.  He did so.  Then he and MacKelpie sealed it also
with their own seals, Then he put it in another envelope, which he sealed
himself, and he and MacKelpie signed it across the flap.

Then father stood up, and so did I.  So did the two men--the clerk and
the shorthand writer.  Father did not say a word till we got out into the
street.  We walked along, and presently we passed an open gate into the
fields.  He turned back, saying to me:

"Come in here.  There is no one about, and we can be quiet.  I want to
speak to you."  When we sat down on a seat with none other near it,
father said:

"You are a student of the law.  What does all that mean?"  I thought it a
good occasion for an epigram, so I said one word:

"Bilk!"

"H'm!" said father; "that is so far as you and I are concerned.  You with
a beggarly ten thousand, and I with twenty.  But what is, or will be, the
effect of those secret trusts?"

"Oh, that," I said, "will, I dare say, be all right.  Uncle Roger
evidently did not intend the older generation to benefit too much by his
death.  But he only gave Rupert St. Leger one thousand pounds, whilst he
gave me ten.  That looks as if he had more regard for the direct line.
Of course--"  Father interrupted me:

"But what was the meaning of a further sum?"

"I don't know, father.  There was evidently some condition which he was
to fulfil; but he evidently didn't expect that he would.  Why, otherwise,
did he leave a second trust to Mr. Trent?"

"True!" said father.  Then he went on: "I wonder why he left those
enormous sums to Trent and old MacKelpie.  They seem out of all
proportion as executors' fees, unless--"

"Unless what, father?"

"Unless the fortune he has left is an enormous one.  That is why I
asked."

"And that," I laughed, "is why he refused to answer."

"Why, Ernest, it must run into big figures."

"Right-ho, father.  The death-duties will be annoying.  What a beastly
swindle the death-duties are!  Why, I shall suffer even on your own
little estate . . . "

"That will do!" he said curtly.  Father is so ridiculously touchy.  One
would think he expects to live for ever.  Presently he spoke again:

"I wonder what are the conditions of that trust.  They are as
important--almost--as the amount of the bequest--whatever it is.  By the
way, there seems to be no mention in the will of a residuary legatee.
Ernest, my boy, we may have to fight over that."

"How do you make that out, father?" I asked.  He had been very rude over
the matter of the death-duties of his own estate, though it is entailed
and I _must_ inherit.  So I determined to let him see that I know a good
deal more than he does--of law, at any rate.  "I fear that when we come
to look into it closely that dog won't fight.  In the first place, that
may be all arranged in the letter to St. Leger, which is a part of the
Will.  And if that letter should be inoperative by his refusal of the
conditions (whatever they may be), then the letter to the attorney begins
to work.  What it is we don't know, and perhaps even he doesn't--I looked
at it as well as I could--and we law men are trained to observation.  But
even if the instructions mentioned as being in Letter C fail, then the
corpus of the Will gives full power to Trent to act just as he darn
pleases.  He can give the whole thing to himself if he likes, and no one
can say a word.  In fact, he is himself the final court of appeal."

"H'm!" said father to himself.  "It is a queer kind of will, I take it,
that can override the Court of Chancery.  We shall perhaps have to try it
before we are done with this!"  With that he rose, and we walked home
together--without saying another word.

My mother was very inquisitive about the whole thing--women always are.
Father and I between us told her all it was necessary for her to know.  I
think we were both afraid that, woman-like, she would make trouble for us
by saying or doing something injudicious.  Indeed, she manifested such
hostility towards Rupert St. Leger that it is quite on the cards that she
may try to injure him in some way.  So when father said that he would
have to go out shortly again, as he wished to consult his solicitor, I
jumped up and said I would go with him, as I, too, should take advice as
to how I stood in the matter.

    "This letter an integral part of my Last Will regards the entire
    residue of my estate beyond the specific bequests made in the body of
    my Will.  It is to appoint as Residuary Legatee of such Will--in case
    he may accept in due form the Conditions herein laid down--my dear
    Nephew Rupert Sent Leger only son of my sister Patience Melton now
    deceased by her marriage with Captain Rupert Sent Leger also now
    deceased.  On his acceptance of the Conditions and the fulfilment of
    the first of them the Entire residue of my estate after payments of
    all specific Legacies and of all my debts and other obligations is to
    become his absolute property to be dealt with or disposed of as he
    may desire.  The following are the conditions.

    "1.  He is to accept provisionally by letter addressed to my
    Executors a sum of nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand pounds
    sterling free of all Duties Taxes or other imposts.  This he will
    hold for a period of six months from the date of the Reading of my
    Last Will and have user of the accruements thereto calculated at the
    rate of ten per centum per annum which amount he shall under no
    circumstances be required to replace.  At the end of said six months
    he must express in writing directed to the Executors of my Will his
    acceptance or refusal of the other conditions herein to follow.  But
    if he may so choose he shall be free to declare in writing to the
    Executors within one week from the time of the Reading of the Will
    his wish to accept or to withdraw altogether from the responsibility
    of this Trust.  In case of withdrawal he is to retain absolutely and
    for his own use the above-mentioned sum of nine hundred and
    ninety-nine thousand pounds sterling free of all Duties Taxes and
    imposts whatsoever making with the specific bequest of one thousand
    pounds a clear sum of one million pounds sterling free of all
    imposts.  And he will from the moment of the delivery of such written
    withdrawal cease to have any right or interest whatsoever in the
    further disposition of my estate under this instrument.  Should such
    written withdrawal be received by my Executors they shall have
    possession of such residue of my estate as shall remain after the
    payment of the above sum of nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand
    pounds sterling and the payment of all Duties Taxes assessments or
    Imposts as may be entailed by law by its conveyance to the said
    Rupert Sent Leger and these my Executors shall hold the same for the
    further disposal of it according to the instructions given in the
    letter marked C and which is also an integral part of my Last Will
    and Testament.

    "2.  If at or before the expiration of the six months above-mentioned
    the said Rupert Sent Leger shall have accepted the further conditions
    herein stated, he is to have user of the entire income produced by
    such residue of my estate the said income being paid to him Quarterly
    on the usual Quarter Days by the aforesaid Executors to wit Major
    General Sir Colin Alexander MacKelpie Bart. and Edward Bingham Trent
    to be used by him in accordance with the terms and conditions
    hereinafter mentioned.

    "3.  The said Rupert Sent Leger is to reside for a period of at least
    six months to begin not later than three months from the reading of
    my Will in the Castle of Vissarion in the Land of the Blue Mountains.
    And if he fulfil the Conditions imposed on him and shall thereby
    become possessed of the residue of my estate he is to continue to
    reside there in part for a period of one year.  He is not to change
    his British Nationality except by a formal consent of the Privy
    Council of Great Britain.

    "At the end of a year and a half from the Reading of my Will he is to
    report in person to my Executors of the expenditure of amounts paid
    or due by him in the carrying out of the Trust and if they are
    satisfied that same are in general accord with the conditions named
    in above-mentioned letter marked C and which is an integral part of
    my Will they are to record their approval on such Will which can then
    go for final Probate and Taxation.  On the Completion of which the
    said Rupert Sent Leger shall become possessed absolutely and without
    further act or need of the entire residue of my estate.  In witness
    whereof, etc.

                                                  "(Signed) ROGER MELTON."

    MEMORANDA MADE BY EDWARD BINGHAM TRENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE WILL OF
    ROGER MELTON.

                                                        _January_ 3, 1907.

    The interests and issues of all concerned in the Will and estate of
    the late Roger Melton of Openshaw Grange are so vast that in case any
    litigation should take place regarding the same, I, as the solicitor,
    having the carriage of the testator's wishes, think it well to make
    certain memoranda of events, conversations, etc., not covered by
    documentary evidence.  I make the first memorandum immediately after
    the event, whilst every detail of act and conversation is still fresh
    in my mind.  I shall also try to make such comments thereon as may
    serve to refresh my memory hereafter, and which in case of my death
    may perhaps afford as opinions contemporaneously recorded some
    guiding light to other or others who may later on have to continue
    and complete the tasks entrusted to me.

    I.

    CONCERNING THE READING OF THE WILL OF ROGER MELTON.

    When, beginning at 11 o'clock a.m. on this the forenoon of Thursday,
    the 3rd day of January, 1907, I opened the Will and read it in full,
    except the clauses contained in the letters marked "B" and "C"; there
    were present in addition to myself, the following:

    1.  Ernest Halbard Melton, J.P, nephew of the testator.

    2.  Ernest Roger Halbard Melton, son of the above.

    3.  Rupert Sent Leger, nephew of the testator.

    4.  Major-General Sir Colin Alexander MacKelpie, Bart., co-executor
    with myself of the Will.

    5.  Andrew Rossiter, my clerk, one of the witnesses of the testator's
    Will.

    6.  Alfred Nugent, stenographer (of Messrs. Castle's office, 21,
    Bream's Buildings, W.C.).

When the Will had been read, Mr. E. H. Melton asked the value of the
estate left by the testator, which query I did not feel empowered or
otherwise able to answer; and a further query, as to why those present
were not shown the secret clauses of the Will.  I answered by reading the
instructions endorsed on the envelopes of the two letters marked "B" and
"C," which were sufficiently explanatory.

But, lest any question should hereafter arise as to the fact that the
memoranda in letters marked "B" and "C," which were to be read as clauses
10 and 11 of the Will, I caused Rupert Sent Leger to open the envelope
marked "B" in the presence of all in the room.  These all signed a paper
which I had already prepared, to the effect that they had seen the
envelope opened, and that the memorandum marked "B.  To be read as clause
ten of my Will," was contained in the envelope, of which it was to be the
sole contents.  Mr. Ernest Halbard Melton, J.P., before signing,
carefully examined with a magnifying-glass, for which he had asked, both
the envelope and the heading of the memorandum enclosed in the letter.
He was about to turn the folded paper which was lying on the table over,
by which he might have been able to read the matter of the memorandum had
he so desired.  I at once advised him that the memorandum he was to sign
dealt only with the heading of the page, and not with the matter.  He
looked very angry, but said nothing, and after a second scrutiny signed.
I put the memorandum in an envelope, which we all signed across the flap.
Before signing, Mr Ernest Halbard Melton took out the paper and verified
it.  I then asked him to close it, which he did, and when the sealing-wax
was on it he sealed it with his own seal.  Sir Colin A. MacKelpie and I
also appended our own seals.  I put the envelope in another, which I
sealed with my own seal, and my co-executor and I signed it across the
flap and added the date.  I took charge of this.  When the others present
had taken their departure, my co-executor and I, together with Mr. Rupert
Sent Leger, who had remained at my request, went into my private room.

Here Mr. Rupert Sent Leger read the memorandum marked "B," which is to be
read as clause 10 of the Will.  He is evidently a man of considerable
nerve, for his face was quite impassive as he read the document, which
conveyed to him (subject to the conditions laid down) a fortune which has
no equal in amount in Europe, even, so far as I know, amongst the crowned
heads.  When he had read it over a second time he stood up and said:

"I wish I had known my uncle better.  He must have had the heart of a
king.  I never heard of such generosity as he has shown me.  Mr. Trent, I
see, from the conditions of this memorandum, or codicil, or whatever it
is, that I am to declare within a week as to whether I accept the
conditions imposed on me.  Now, I want you to tell me this: must I wait a
week to declare?"  In answer, I told him that the testator's intention
was manifestly to see that he had full time to consider fully every point
before making formal decision and declaration.  But, in answer to the
specific question, I could answer that he might make declaration when he
would, provided it was _within_, or rather not after, the week named.  I
added:

"But I strongly advise you not to act hurriedly.  So enormous a sum is
involved that you may be sure that all possible efforts will be made by
someone or other to dispossess you of your inheritance, and it will be
well that everything shall be done, not only in perfect order, but with
such manifest care and deliberation that there can be no question as to
your intention."

"Thank you, sir," he answered; "I shall do as you shall kindly advise me
in this as in other things.  But I may tell you now--and you, too, my
dear Sir Colin--that I not only accept my Uncle Roger's conditions in
this, but that when the time comes in the other matters I shall accept
every condition that he had in his mind--and that I may know of--in
everything."  He looked exceedingly in earnest, and it gave me much
pleasure to see and hear him.  It was just what a young man should do who
had seen so generously treated.  As the time had now come, I gave him the
bulky letter addressed to him, marked "D" which I had in my safe.  As I
fulfilled my obligation in the matter, I said:

"You need not read the letter here.  You can take it away with you, and
read it by yourself at leisure.  It is your own property, without any
obligation whatever attached to it.  By the way, perhaps it would be well
if you knew.  I have a copy sealed up in an envelope, and endorsed, 'To
be opened if occasion should arise,' but not otherwise.  Will you see me
to-morrow, or, better still, dine with me alone here to-night?  I should
like to have a talk with you, and you may wish to ask me some questions."
He answered me cordially.  I actually felt touched by the way he said
good-bye before he went away.  Sir Colin MacKelpie went with him, as Sent
Leger was to drop him at the Reform.

    My Dear Nephew,

    When (if ever) you receive this you will know that (with the
    exception of some definite bequests) I have left to you, under
    certain conditions, the entire bulk of my fortune--a fortune so great
    that by its aid as a help, a man of courage and ability may carve out
    for himself a name and place in history.  The specific conditions
    contained in Clause 10 of my Will have to be observed, for such I
    deem to be of service to your own fortune; but herein I give my
    advice, which you are at liberty to follow or not as you will, and my
    wishes, which I shall try to explain fully and clearly, so that you
    may be in possession of my views in case you should desire to carry
    them out, or, at least, to so endeavour that the results I hope for
    may be ultimately achieved.  First let me explain--for your
    understanding and your guidance--that the power, or perhaps it had
    better be called the pressure, behind the accumulation of my fortune
    has been ambition.  In obedience to its compulsion, I toiled early
    and late until I had so arranged matters that, subject to broad
    supervision, my ideas could be carried out by men whom I had selected
    and tested, and not found wanting.  This was for years to the
    satisfaction, and ultimately to the accumulation by these men of
    fortune commensurate in some measure to their own worth and their
    importance to my designs.  Thus I had accumulated, whilst still a
    young man, a considerable fortune.  This I have for over forty years
    used sparingly as regards my personal needs, daringly with regard to
    speculative investments.  With the latter I took such very great
    care, studying the conditions surrounding them so thoroughly, that
    even now my schedule of bad debts or unsuccessful investments is
    almost a blank.  Perhaps by such means things flourished with me, and
    wealth piled in so fast that at times I could hardly use it to
    advantage.  This was all done as the forerunner of ambition, but I
    was over fifty years of age when the horizon of ambition itself
    opened up to me.  I speak thus freely, my dear Rupert, as when you
    read it I shall have passed away, and not ambition nor the fear of
    misunderstanding, nor even of scorn can touch me.  My ventures in
    commerce and finance covered not only the Far East, but every foot of
    the way to it, so that the Mediterranean and all its opening seas
    were familiar to me.  In my journeyings up and down the Adriatic I
    was always struck by the great beauty and seeming richness--native
    richness--of the Land of the Blue Mountains.  At last Chance took me
    into that delectable region.  When the "Balkan Struggle" of '90 was
    on, one of the great Voivodes came to me in secret to arrange a large
    loan for national purposes.  It was known in financial circles of
    both Europe and Asia that I took an active part in the _haute
    politique_ of national treasuries, and the Voivode Vissarion came to
    me as to one able and willing to carry out his wishes.  After
    confidential pour-parlers, he explained to me that his nation was in
    the throes of a great crisis.  As you perhaps know, the gallant
    little Nation in the Land of the Blue Mountains has had a strange
    history.  For more than a thousand years--ever since its settlement
    after the disaster of Rossoro--it had maintained its national
    independence under several forms of Government.  At first it had a
    King whose successors became so despotic that they were dethroned.
    Then it was governed by its Voivodes, with the combining influence of
    a Vladika somewhat similar in power and function to the
    Prince-Bishops of Montenegro; afterwards by a Prince; or, as at
    present, by an irregular elective Council, influenced in a modified
    form by the Vladika, who was then supposed to exercise a purely
    spiritual function.  Such a Council in a small, poor nation did not
    have sufficient funds for armaments, which were not immediately and
    imperatively necessary; and therefore the Voivode Vissarion, who had
    vast estates in his own possession, and who was the present
    representative a family which of old had been leaders in the land,
    found it a duty to do on his own account that which the State could
    not do.  For security as to the loan which he wished to get, and
    which was indeed a vast one, he offered to sell me his whole estate
    if I would secure to him a right to repurchase it within a given time
    (a time which I may say has some time ago expired).  He made it a
    condition that the sale and agreement should remain a strict secret
    between us, as a widespread knowledge that his estate had changed
    hands would in all probability result in my death and his own at the
    hands of the mountaineers, who are beyond everything loyal, and were
    jealous to the last degree.  An attack by Turkey was feared, and new
    armaments were required; and the patriotic Voivode was sacrificing
    his own great fortune for the public good.  What a sacrifice this was
    he well knew, for in all discussions regarding a possible change in
    the Constitution of the Blue Mountains it was always taken for
    granted that if the principles of the Constitution should change to a
    more personal rule, his own family should be regarded as the Most
    Noble.  It had ever been on the side of freedom in olden time; before
    the establishment of the Council, or even during the rule of the
    Voivodes, the Vissarion had every now and again stood out against the
    King or challenged the Princedom.  The very name stood for freedom,
    for nationality, against foreign oppression; and the bold
    mountaineers were devoted to it, as in other free countries men
    follow the flag.

    Such loyalty was a power and a help in the land, for it knew danger
    in every form; and anything which aided the cohesion of its integers
    was a natural asset.  On every side other powers, great and small,
    pressed the land, anxious to acquire its suzerainty by any
    means--fraud or force.  Greece, Turkey, Austria, Russia, Italy,
    France, had all tried in vain.  Russia, often hurled back, was
    waiting an opportunity to attack.  Austria and Greece, although
    united by no common purpose or design, were ready to throw in their
    forces with whomsoever might seem most likely to be victor.  Other
    Balkan States, too, were not lacking in desire to add the little
    territory of the Blue Mountains to their more ample possessions.
    Albania, Dalmatia, Herzegovina, Servia, Bulgaria, looked with lustful
    eyes on the land, which was in itself a vast natural fortress, having
    close under its shelter perhaps the finest harbour between Gibraltar
    and the Dardanelles.

    But the fierce, hardy mountaineers were unconquerable.  For centuries
    they had fought, with a fervour and fury that nothing could withstand
    or abate, attacks on their independence.  Time after time, century
    after century, they had opposed with dauntless front invading armies
    sent against them.  This unquenchable fire of freedom had had its
    effect.  One and all, the great Powers knew that to conquer that
    little nation would be no mean task, but rather that of a tireless
    giant.  Over and over again had they fought with units against
    hundreds, never ceasing until they had either wiped out their foes
    entirely or seen them retreat across the frontier in diminished
    numbers.

    For many years past, however, the Land of the Blue Mountains had
    remained unassailable, for all the Powers and States had feared lest
    the others should unite against the one who should begin the attack.

    At the time I speak of there was a feeling throughout the Blue
    Mountains--and, indeed, elsewhere--that Turkey was preparing for a
    war of offence.  The objective of her attack was not known anywhere,
    but here there was evidence that the Turkish "Bureau of Spies" was in
    active exercise towards their sturdy little neighbour.  To prepare
    for this, the Voivode Peter Vissarion approached me in order to
    obtain the necessary "sinews of war."

    The situation was complicated by the fact that the Elective Council
    was at present largely held together by the old Greek Church, which
    was the religion of the people, and which had had since the beginning
    its destinies linked in a large degree with theirs.  Thus it was
    possible that if a war should break out, it might easily
    become--whatever might have been its cause or beginnings--a war of
    creeds.  This in the Balkans must be largely one of races, the end of
    which no mind could diagnose or even guess at.

    I had now for some time had knowledge of the country and its people,
    and had come to love them both.  The nobility of Vissarion's
    self-sacrifice at once appealed to me, and I felt that I, too, should
    like to have a hand in the upholding of such a land and such a
    people.  They both deserved freedom.  When Vissarion handed me the
    completed deed of sale I was going to tear it up; but he somehow
    recognized my intention, and forestalled it.  He held up his hand
    arrestingly as he said:

    "I recognize your purpose, and, believe me, I honour you for it from
    the very depths of my soul.  But, my friend, it must not be.  Our
    mountaineers are proud beyond belief.  Though they would allow
    me--who am one of themselves, and whose fathers have been in some way
    leaders and spokesmen amongst them for many centuries--to do all that
    is in my power to do--and what, each and all, they would be glad to
    do were the call to them--they would not accept aid from one outside
    themselves.  My good friend, they would resent it, and might show to
    you, who wish us all so well, active hostility, which might end in
    danger, or even death.  That was why, my friend, I asked to put a
    clause in our agreement, that I might have right to repurchase my
    estate, regarding which you would fain act so generously."

    Thus it is, my dear nephew Rupert, only son of my dear sister, that I
    hereby charge you solemnly as you value me--as you value yourself--as
    you value honour, that, should it ever become known that that noble
    Voivode, Peter Vissarion, imperilled himself for his country's good,
    and if it be of danger or evil repute to him that even for such a
    purpose he sold his heritage, you shall at once and to the knowledge
    of the mountaineers--though not necessarily to others--reconvey to
    him or his heirs the freehold that he was willing to part with--and
    that he has _de facto_ parted with by the effluxion of the time
    during which his right of repurchase existed.  This is a secret trust
    and duty which is between thee and me alone in the first instance; a
    duty which I have undertaken on behalf of my heirs, and which must be
    carried out, at whatsoever cost may ensue.  You must not take it that
    it is from any mistrust of you or belief that you will fail that I
    have taken another measure to insure that this my cherished idea is
    borne out.  Indeed, it is that the law may, in case of need--for no
    man can know what may happen after his own hand be taken from the
    plough--be complied with, that I have in another letter written for
    the guidance of others, directed that in case of any failure to carry
    out this trust--death or other--the direction become a clause or
    codicil to my Will.  But in the meantime I wish that this be kept a
    secret between us two.  To show you the full extent of my confidence,
    let me here tell you that the letter alluded to above is marked "C,"
    and directed to my solicitor and co-executor, Edward Bingham Trent,
    which is finally to be regarded as clause eleven of my Will.  To
    which end he has my instructions and also a copy of this letter,
    which is, in case of need, and that only, to be opened, and is to be
    a guide to my wishes as to the carrying out by you of the conditions
    on which you inherit.

    And now, my dear nephew, let me change to another subject more dear
    to me--yourself.  When you read this I shall have passed away, so
    that I need not be hampered now by that reserve which I feel has
    grown upon me through a long and self-contained life.  Your mother
    was very dear to me.  As you know, she was twenty years younger than
    her youngest brother, who was two years younger than me.  So we were
    all young men when she was a baby, and, I need not say, a pet amongst
    us--almost like our own child to each of us, as well as our sister.
    You knew her sweetness and high quality, so I need say nothing of
    these; but I should like you to understand that she was very dear to
    me.  When she and your father came to know and love each other I was
    far away, opening up a new branch of business in the interior of
    China, and it was not for several months that I got home news.  When
    I first heard of him they had already been married.  I was delighted
    to find that they were very happy.  They needed nothing that I could
    give.  When he died so suddenly I tried to comfort her, and all I had
    was at her disposal, did she want it.  She was a proud woman--though
    not with me.  She had come to understand that, though I seemed cold
    and hard (and perhaps was so generally), I was not so to her.  But
    she would not have help of any kind.  When I pressed her, she told me
    that she had enough for your keep and education and her own
    sustenance for the time she must still live; that your father and she
    had agreed that you should be brought up to a healthy and strenuous
    life rather than to one of luxury; and she thought that it would be
    better for the development of your character that you should learn to
    be self-reliant and to be content with what your dear father had left
    you.  She had always been a wise and thoughtful girl, and now all her
    wisdom and thought were for you, your father's and her child.  When
    she spoke of you and your future, she said many things which I
    thought memorable.  One of them I remember to this day.  It was
    apropos of my saying that there is a danger of its own kind in
    extreme poverty.  A young man might know too much want.  She answered
    me: "True!  That is so!  But there is a danger that overrides it;"
    and after a time went on:

    "It is better not to know wants than not to know want!"  I tell you,
    boy, that is a great truth, and I hope you will remember it for
    yourself as well as a part of the wisdom of your mother.  And here
    let me say something else which is a sort of corollary of that wise
    utterance:

    I dare say you thought me very hard and unsympathetic that time I
    would not, as one of your trustees, agree to your transferring your
    little fortune to Miss MacKelpie.  I dare say you bear a grudge
    towards me about it up to this day.  Well, if you have any of that
    remaining, put it aside when you know the truth.  That request of
    yours was an unspeakable delight to me.  It was like your mother
    coming back from the dead.  That little letter of yours made me wish
    for the first time that I had a son--and that he should be like you.
    I fell into a sort of reverie, thinking if I were yet too old to
    marry, so that a son might be with me in my declining years--if such
    were to ever be for me.  But I concluded that this might not be.
    There was no woman whom I knew or had ever met with that I could love
    as your mother loved your father and as he loved her.  So I resigned
    myself to my fate.  I must go my lonely road on to the end.  And then
    came a ray of light into my darkness: there was you.  Though you
    might not feel like a son to me--I could not expect it when the
    memory of that sweet relationship was more worthily filled.  But I
    could feel like a father to you.  Nothing could prevent that or
    interfere with it, for I would keep it as my secret in the very holy
    of holies of my heart, where had been for thirty years the image of a
    sweet little child--your mother.  My boy, when in your future life
    you shall have happiness and honour and power, I hope you will
    sometimes give a thought to the lonely old man whose later years your
    very existence seemed to brighten.

    The thought of your mother recalled me to my duty.  I had undertaken
    for her a sacred task: to carry out her wishes regarding her son.  I
    knew how she would have acted.  It might--would--have been to her a
    struggle of inclination and duty; and duty would have won.  And so I
    carried out my duty, though I tell you it was a harsh and bitter task
    to me at the time.  But I may tell you that I have since been glad
    when I think of the result.  I tried, as you may perhaps remember, to
    carry out your wishes in another way, but your letter put the
    difficulty of doing so so clearly before me that I had to give it up.
    And let me tell you that that letter endeared you to me more than
    ever.

    I need not tell you that thenceforth I followed your life very
    closely.  When you ran away to sea, I used in secret every part of
    the mechanism of commerce to find out what had become of you.  Then,
    until you had reached your majority, I had a constant watch kept upon
    you--not to interfere with you in any way, but so that I might be
    able to find you should need arise.  When in due course I heard of
    your first act on coming of age I was satisfied.  I had to know of
    the carrying out of your original intention towards Janet Mac Kelpie,
    for the securities had to be transferred.

    From that time on I watched--of course through other eyes--your chief
    doings.  It would have been a pleasure to me to have been able to
    help in carrying out any hope or ambition of yours, but I realized
    that in the years intervening between your coming of age and the
    present moment you were fulfilling your ideas and ambitions in your
    own way, and, as I shall try to explain to you presently, my
    ambitions also.  You were of so adventurous a nature that even my own
    widely-spread machinery of acquiring information--what I may call my
    private "intelligence department"--was inadequate.  My machinery was
    fairly adequate for the East--in great part, at all events.  But you
    went North and South, and West also, and, in addition, you essayed
    realms where commerce and purely real affairs have no
    foothold--worlds of thought, of spiritual import, of psychic
    phenomena--speaking generally, of mysteries.  As now and again I was
    baffled in my inquiries, I had to enlarge my mechanism, and to this
    end started--not in my own name, of course--some new magazines
    devoted to certain branches of inquiry and adventure.  Should you
    ever care to know more of these things, Mr. Trent, in whose name the
    stock is left, will be delighted to give you all details.  Indeed,
    these stocks, like all else I have, shall be yours when the time
    comes, if you care to ask for them.  By means of _The Journal of
    Adventure_, _The Magazine of Mystery_, _Occultism_, _Balloon and
    Aeroplane_, _The Submarine_, _Jungle and Pampas_, _The Ghost World_,
    _The Explorer_, _Forest and Island_, _Ocean and Creek_, I was often
    kept informed when I should otherwise have been ignorant of your
    whereabouts and designs.  For instance, when you had disappeared into
    the Forest of the Incas, I got the first whisper of your strange
    adventures and discoveries in the buried cities of Eudori from a
    correspondent of _The Journal of Adventure_ long before the details
    given in _The Times_ of the rock-temple of the primeval savages,
    where only remained the little dragon serpents, whose giant ancestors
    were rudely sculptured on the sacrificial altar.  I well remember how
    I thrilled at even that meagre account of your going in alone into
    that veritable hell.  It was from _Occultism_ that I learned how you
    had made a stay alone in the haunted catacombs of Elora, in the far
    recesses of the Himalayas, and of the fearful experiences which, when
    you came out shuddering and ghastly, overcame to almost epileptic
    fear those who had banded themselves together to go as far as the
    rock-cut approach to the hidden temple.

    All such things I read with rejoicing.  You were shaping yourself for
    a wider and loftier adventure, which would crown more worthily your
    matured manhood.  When I read of you in a description of Mihask, in
    Madagascar, and the devil-worship there rarely held, I felt I had
    only to wait for your home-coming in order to broach the enterprise I
    had so long contemplated.  This was what I read:

    "He is a man to whom no adventure is too wild or too daring.  His
    reckless bravery is a byword amongst many savage peoples and amongst
    many others not savages, whose fears are not of material things, but
    of the world of mysteries in and beyond the grave.  He dares not only
    wild animals and savage men; but has tackled African magic and Indian
    mysticism.  The Psychical Research Society has long exploited his
    deeds of valiance, and looked upon him as perhaps their most trusted
    agent or source of discovery.  He is in the very prime of life, of
    almost giant stature and strength, trained to the use of all arms of
    all countries, inured to every kind of hardship, subtle-minded and
    resourceful, understanding human nature from its elemental form up.
    To say that he is fearless would be inadequate.  In a word, he is a
    man whose strength and daring fit him for any enterprise of any kind.
    He would dare and do anything in the world or out of it, on the earth
    or under it, in the sea or--in the air, fearing nothing material or
    unseen, not man or ghost, nor God nor Devil."

    If you ever care to think of it, I carried that cutting in my
    pocket-book from that hour I read it till now.

    Remember, again, I say, that I never interfered in the slightest way
    in any of your adventures.  I wanted you to "dree your own weird," as
    the Scotch say; and I wanted to know of it--that was all.  Now, as I
    hold you fully equipped for greater enterprise, I want to set your
    feet on the road and to provide you with the most potent
    weapon--beyond personal qualities--for the winning of great honour--a
    gain, my dear nephew, which, I am right sure, does and will appeal to
    you as it has ever done to me.  I have worked for it for more than
    fifty years; but now that the time has come when the torch is
    slipping from my old hands, I look to you, my dearest kinsman, to
    lift it and carry it on.

    The little nation of the Blue Mountains has from the first appealed
    to me.  It is poor and proud and brave.  Its people are well worth
    winning, and I would advise you to throw in your lot with them.  You
    may find them hard to win, for when peoples, like individuals, are
    poor and proud, these qualities are apt to react on each other to an
    endless degree.  These men are untamable, and no one can ever succeed
    with them unless he is with them in all-in-all, and is a leader
    recognized.  But if you can win them they are loyal to death.  If you
    are ambitious--and I know you are--there may be a field for you in
    such a country.  With your qualifications, fortified by the fortune
    which I am happy enough to be able to leave you, you may dare much
    and go far.  Should I be alive when you return from your exploration
    in Northern South America, I may have the happiness of helping you to
    this or any other ambition, and I shall deem it a privilege to share
    it with you; but time is going on.  I am in my seventy-second year .
    . . the years of man are three-score and ten--I suppose you
    understand; I do . . . Let me point out this: For ambitious projects
    the great nationalities are impossible to a stranger--and in our own
    we are limited by loyalty (and common-sense).  It is only in a small
    nation that great ambitions can be achieved.  If you share my own
    views and wishes, the Blue Mountains is your ground.  I hoped at one
    time that I might yet become a Voivode--even a great one.  But age
    has dulled my personal ambitions as it has cramped my powers.  I no
    longer dream of such honour for myself, though I do look on it as a
    possibility for you if you care for it.  Through my Will you will
    have a great position and a great estate, and though you may have to
    yield up the latter in accordance with my wish, as already expressed
    in this letter, the very doing so will give you an even greater hold
    than this possession in the hearts of the mountaineers, should they
    ever come to know it.  Should it be that at the time you inherit from
    me the Voivode Vissarion should not be alive, it may serve or aid you
    to know that in such case you would be absolved from any conditions
    of mine, though I trust you would in that, as in all other matters,
    hold obligation enforced by your own honour as to my wishes.
    Therefore the matter stands thus: If Vissarion lives, you will
    relinquish the estates.  Should such not be the case, you will act as
    you believe that I would wish you to.  In either case the
    mountaineers should not know from you in any way of the secret
    contracts between Vissarion and myself.  Enlightenment of the many
    should (if ever) come from others than yourself.  And unless such
    take place, you would leave the estates without any _quid pro quo_
    whatever.  This you need not mind, for the fortune you will inherit
    will leave you free and able to purchase other estates in the Blue
    Mountains or elsewhere that you may select in the world.

    If others attack, attack them, and quicker and harder than they can,
    if such be a possibility.  Should it ever be that you inherit the
    Castle of Vissarion on the Spear of Ivan, remember that I had it
    secretly fortified and armed against attack.  There are not only
    massive grilles, but doors of chilled bronze where such be needed.
    My adherent Rooke, who has faithfully served me for nearly forty
    years, and has gone on my behalf on many perilous expeditions, will,
    I trust, serve you in the same way.  Treat him well for my sake, if
    not for your own.  I have left him provision for a life of ease; but
    he would rather take a part in dangerous enterprises.  He is silent
    as the grave and as bold as a lion.  He knows every detail of the
    fortification and of the secret means of defence.  A word in your
    ear--he was once a pirate.  He was then in his extreme youth, and
    long since changed his ways in this respect; but from this fact you
    can understand his nature.  You will find him useful should occasion
    ever arise.  Should you accept the conditions of my letter, you are
    to make the Blue Mountains--in part, at least--your home, living
    there a part of the year, if only for a week, as in England men of
    many estates share the time amongst them.  To this you are not bound,
    and no one shall have power to compel you or interfere with you.  I
    only express a hope.  But one thing I do more than hope--I desire, if
    you will honour my wishes, that, come what may, you are to keep your
    British nationality, unless by special arrangement with and consent
    of the Privy Council.  Such arrangement to be formally made by my
    friend, Edward Bingham Trent, or whomsoever he may appoint by deed or
    will to act in the matter, and made in such a way that no act save
    that alone of Parliament in all its estates, and endorsed by the
    King, may or can prevail against it.

    My last word to you is, Be bold and honest, and fear not.  Most
    things--even kingship--_somewhere_ may now and again be won by the
    sword.  A brave heart and a strong arm may go far.  But whatever is
    so won cannot be held merely by the sword.  Justice alone can hold in
    the long run.  Where men trust they will follow, and the rank and
    file of people want to follow, not to lead.  If it be your fortune to
    lead, be bold.  Be wary, if you will; exercise any other faculties
    that may aid or guard.  Shrink from nothing.  Avoid nothing that is
    honourable in itself.  Take responsibility when such presents itself.
    What others shrink from, accept.  That is to be great in what world,
    little or big, you move.  Fear nothing, no matter of what kind danger
    may be or whence it come.  The only real way to meet danger is to
    despise it--except with your brains.  Meet it in the gate, not the
    hall.

    My kinsman, the name of my race and your own, worthily mingled in
    your own person, now rests with you!

    MY DEAREST AUNT JANET,

    You will, I know, be rejoiced to hear of the great good-fortune which
    has come to me through the Will of Uncle Roger.  Perhaps Sir Colin
    will have written to you, as he is one of the executors, and there is
    a bequest to you, so I must not spoil his pleasure of telling you of
    that part himself.  Unfortunately, I am not free to speak fully of my
    own legacy yet, but I want you to know that at worst I am to receive
    an amount many times more than I ever dreamt of possessing through
    any possible stroke of fortune.  So soon as I can leave
    London--where, of course, I must remain until things are settled--I
    am coming up to Croom to see you, and I hope I shall by then be able
    to let you know so much that you will be able to guess at the
    extraordinary change that has come to my circumstances.  It is all
    like an impossible dream: there is nothing like it in the "Arabian
    Nights."  However, the details must wait, I am pledged to secrecy for
    the present.  And you must be pledged too.  You won't mind, dear,
    will you?  What I want to do at present is merely to tell you of my
    own good-fortune, and that I shall be going presently to live for a
    while at Vissarion.  Won't you come with me, Aunt Janet?  We shall
    talk more of this when I come to Croom; but I want you to keep the
    subject in your mind.

                                                               Your loving
                                                                   RUPERT.

_From Rupert Sent Leger's Journal_.

                                                        _January_ 4, 1907.

    Things have been humming about me so fast that I have had hardly time
    to think.  But some of the things have been so important, and have so
    changed my entire outlook on life, that it may be well to keep some
    personal record of them.  I may some day want to remember some
    detail--perhaps the sequence of events, or something like that--and
    it may be useful.  It ought to be, if there is any justice in things,
    for it will be an awful swot to write it when I have so many things
    to think of now.  Aunt Janet, I suppose, will like to keep it locked
    up for me, as she does with all my journals and papers.  That is one
    good thing about Aunt Janet amongst many: she has no curiosity, or
    else she has some other quality which keeps her from prying as other
    women would.  It would seem that she has not so much as opened the
    cover of one of my journals ever in her life, and that she would not
    without my permission.  So this can in time go to her also.

    I dined last night with Mr. Trent, by his special desire.  The dinner
    was in his own rooms.  Dinner sent in from the hotel.  He would not
    have any waiters at all, but made them send in the dinner all at
    once, and we helped ourselves.  As we were quite alone, we could talk
    freely, and we got over a lot of ground while we were dining.  He
    began to tell me about Uncle Roger.  I was glad of that, for, of
    course, I wanted to know all I could of him, and the fact was I had
    seen very little of him.  Of course, when I was a small kid he was
    often in our house, for he was very fond of mother, and she of him.
    But I fancy that a small boy was rather a nuisance to him.  And then
    I was at school, and he was away in the East.  And then poor mother
    died while he was living in the Blue Mountains, and I never saw him
    again.  When I wrote to him about Aunt Janet he answered me very
    kindly but he was so very just in the matter that I got afraid of
    him.  And after that I ran away, and have been roaming ever since; so
    there was never a chance of our meeting.  But that letter of his has
    opened my eyes.  To think of him following me that way all over the
    world, waiting to hold out a helping hand if I should want it, I only
    wish I had known, or even suspected, the sort of man he was, and how
    he cared for me, and I would sometimes have come back to see him, if
    I had to come half round the world.  Well, all I can do now is to
    carry out his wishes; that will be my expiation for my neglect.  He
    knew what he wanted exactly, and I suppose I shall come in time to
    know it all and understand it, too.

    I was thinking something like this when Mr. Trent began to talk, so
    that all he said fitted exactly into my own thought.  The two men
    were evidently great friends--I should have gathered that, anyhow,
    from the Will--and the letters--so I was not surprised when Mr. Trent
    told me that they had been to school together, Uncle Roger being a
    senior when he was a junior; and had then and ever after shared each
    other's confidence.  Mr. Trent, I gathered, had from the very first
    been in love with my mother, even when she was a little girl; but he
    was poor and shy, and did not like to speak.  When he had made up his
    mind to do so, he found that she had by then met my father, and could
    not help seeing that they loved each other.  So he was silent.  He
    told me he had never said a word about it to anyone--not even to my
    Uncle Roger, though he knew from one thing and another, though he
    never spoke of it, that he would like it.  I could not help seeing
    that the dear old man regarded me in a sort of parental way--I have
    heard of such romantic attachments being transferred to the later
    generation.  I was not displeased with it; on the contrary, I liked
    him better for it.  I love my mother so much--I always think of her
    in the present--that I cannot think of her as dead.  There is a tie
    between anyone else who loved her and myself.  I tried to let Mr.
    Trent see that I liked him, and it pleased him so much that I could
    see his liking for me growing greater.  Before we parted he told me
    that he was going to give up business.  He must have understood how
    disappointed I was--for how could I ever get along at all without
    him?--for he said, as he laid a hand quite affectionately, I
    thought--on my shoulder:

    "I shall have one client, though, whose business I always hope to
    keep, and for whom I shall be always whilst I live glad to act--if he
    will have me."  I did not care to speak as I took his hand.  He
    squeezed mine, too, and said very earnestly:

    "I served your uncle's interests to the very best of my ability for
    nearly fifty years.  He had full confidence in me, and I was proud of
    his trust.  I can honestly say, Rupert--you won't mind me using that
    familiarity, will you?--that, though the interests which I guarded
    were so vast that without abusing my trust I could often have used my
    knowledge to my personal advantage, I never once, in little matters
    or big, abused that trust--no, not even rubbed the bloom off it.  And
    now that he has remembered me in his Will so generously that I need
    work no more, it will be a very genuine pleasure and pride to me to
    carry out as well as I can the wishes that I partly knew, and now
    realize more fully towards you, his nephew."

    In the long chat which we had, and which lasted till midnight, he
    told me many very interesting things about Uncle Roger.  When, in the
    course of conversation, he mentioned that the fortune Uncle Roger
    left must be well over a hundred millions, I was so surprised that I
    said out loud--I did not mean to ask a question:

    "How on earth could a man beginning with nothing realize such a
    gigantic fortune?"

    "By all honest ways," he answered, "and his clever human insight.  He
    knew one half of the world, and so kept abreast of all public and
    national movements that he knew the critical moment to advance money
    required.  He was always generous, and always on the side of freedom.
    There are nations at this moment only now entering on the
    consolidation of their liberty, who owe all to him, who knew when and
    how to help.  No wonder that in some lands they will drink to his
    memory on great occasions as they used to drink his health."

    "As you and I shall do now, sir!" I said, as I filled my glass and
    stood up.  We drank it in bumpers.  We did not say a word, either of
    us; but the old gentleman held out his hand, and I took it.  And so,
    holding hands, we drank in silence.  It made me feel quite choky; and
    I could see that he, too, was moved.

    I asked Mr. Rupert Sent Leger to dine with me at my office alone, as
    I wished to have a chat with him.  To-morrow Sir Colin and I will
    have a formal meeting with him for the settlement of affairs, but I
    thought it best to have an informal talk with him alone first, as I
    wished to tell him certain matters which will make our meeting
    to-morrow more productive of utility, as he can now have more full
    understanding of the subjects which we have to discuss.  Sir Colin is
    all that can be in manhood, and I could wish no better colleague in
    the executorship of this phenomenal Will; but he has not had the
    privilege of a lifelong friendship with the testator as I have had.
    And as Rupert Sent Leger had to learn intimate details regarding his
    uncle, I could best make my confidences alone.  To-morrow we shall
    have plenty of formality.  I was delighted with Rupert.  He is just
    what I could have wished his mother's boy to be--or a son of my own
    to be, had I had the good-fortune to have been a father.  But this is
    not for me.  I remember long, long ago reading a passage in Lamb's
    Essays which hangs in my mind: "The children of Alice call Bartrum
    father."  Some of my old friends would laugh to see _me_ write this,
    but these memoranda are for my eyes alone, and no one shall see them
    till after my death, unless by my own permission.  The boy takes some
    qualities after his father; he has a daring that is disturbing to an
    old dryasdust lawyer like me.  But somehow I like him more than I
    ever liked anyone--any man--in my life--more even than his uncle, my
    old friend, Roger Melton; and Lord knows I had much cause to like
    him.  I have more than ever now.  It was quite delightful to see the
    way the young adventurer was touched by his uncle's thought of him.
    He is a truly gallant fellow, but venturesome exploits have not
    affected the goodness of heart.  It is a pleasure to me to think that
    Roger and Colin came together apropos of the boy's thoughtful
    generosity towards Miss MacKelpie.  The old soldier will be a good
    friend to him, or I am much mistaken.  With an old lawyer like me,
    and an old soldier like him, and a real old gentlewoman like Miss
    MacKelpie, who loves the very ground he walks on, to look after him,
    together with all his own fine qualities and his marvellous
    experience of the world, and the gigantic wealth that will surely be
    his, that young man will go far.

    MY DEAREST AUNT JANET,

    It is all over--the first stage of it; and that is as far as I can
    get at present.  I shall have to wait for a few days--or it may be
    weeks--in London for the doing of certain things now necessitated by
    my acceptance of Uncle Roger's bequest.  But as soon as I can, dear,
    I shall come down to Croom and spend with you as many days as
    possible.  I shall then tell you all I am at liberty to tell, and I
    shall thank you personally for your consent to come with me to
    Vissarion.  Oh, how I wish my dear mother had lived to be with us!
    It would have made her happy, I know, to have come; and then we three
    who shared together the old dear, hard days would have shared in the
    same way the new splendour.  I would try to show all my love and
    gratitude to you both . . . You must take the whole burden of it now,
    dear, for you and I are alone.  No, not alone, as we used to be, for
    I have now two old friends who are already dear to me.  One is so to
    you already.  Sir Colin is simply splendid, and so, in his own way,
    is Mr. Trent.  I am lucky, Aunt Janet, to have two such men to think
    of affairs for me.  Am I not?  I shall send you a wire as soon as
    ever I can see my way to get through my work; and I want you to think
    over all the things you ever wished for in your life, so that I
    may--if there is any mortal way of doing so--get them for you.  You
    will not stand in the way of my having this great pleasure, will you,
    dear?  Good-bye.

                                                               Your loving
                                                                   RUPERT.

    The formal meeting of Sir Colin and myself with Rupert Sent Leger
    went off quite satisfactorily.  From what he had said yesterday, and
    again last night, I had almost come to expect an unreserved
    acceptance of everything stated or implied in Roger Melton's Will;
    but when we had sat round the table--this appeared, by the way, to be
    a formality for which we were all prepared, for we sat down as if by
    instinct--the very first words he said were:

    "As I suppose I must go through this formality, I may as well say at
    once that I accept every possible condition which was in the mind of
    Uncle Roger; and to this end I am prepared to sign, seal, and
    deliver--or whatever is the ritual--whatever document you,
    sir"--turning to me--"may think necessary or advisable, and of which
    you both approve."  He stood up and walked about the room for a few
    moments, Sir Colin and I sitting quite still, silent.  He came back
    to his seat, and after a few seconds of nervousness--a rare thing
    with him, I fancy--said: "I hope you both understand--of course, I
    know you do; I only speak because this is an occasion for
    formality--that I am willing to accept, and at once!  I do so,
    believe me, not to get possession of this vast fortune, but because
    of him who has given it.  The man who was fond of me, and who trusted
    me, and yet had strength to keep his own feelings in check--who
    followed me in spirit to far lands and desperate adventures, and who,
    though he might be across the world from me, was ready to put out a
    hand to save or help me, was no common man; and his care of my
    mother's son meant no common love for my dear mother.  And so she and
    I together accept his trust, come of it what may.  I have been
    thinking it over all night, and all the time I could not get out of
    the idea that mother was somewhere near me.  The only thought that
    could debar me from doing as I wished to do--and intend to do--would
    be that she would not approve.  Now that I am satisfied she would
    approve, I accept.  Whatever may result or happen, I shall go on
    following the course that he has set for me.  So help me, God!"  Sir
    Colin stood up, and I must say a more martial figure I never saw.  He
    was in full uniform, for he was going on to the King's levee after
    our business.  He drew his sword from the scabbard and laid it naked
    on the table before Rupert, and said:

    "You are going, sir, into a strange and danger country--I have been
    reading about it since we met--and you will be largely alone amongst
    fierce mountaineers who resent the very presence of a stranger, and
    to whom you are, and must be, one.  If you should ever be in any
    trouble and want a man to stand back to back with you, I hope you
    will give me the honour!"  As he said this pointed to his sword.
    Rupert and I were also standing now--one cannot sit down in the
    presence of such an act as that.  "You are, I am proud to say, allied
    with my family: and I only wish to God it was closer to myself."
    Rupert took him by the hand and bent his head before him as answered:

    "The honour is mine, Sir Colin; and no greater can come to any man
    than that which you have just done me.  The best way I can show how I
    value it will be to call on you if I am ever in such a tight place.
    By Jove, sir, this is history repeating itself.  Aunt Janet used to
    tell me when I was a youngster how MacKelpie of Croom laid his sword
    before Prince Charlie.  I hope I may tell her of this; it would make
    her so proud and happy.  Don't imagine, sir, that I am thinking
    myself a Charles Edward.  It is only that Aunt Janet is so good to me
    that I might well think I was."

    Sir Colin bowed grandly:

    "Rupert Sent Leger, my dear niece is a woman of great discretion and
    discernment.  And, moreover, I am thinking she has in her some of the
    gift of Second Sight that has been a heritage of our blood.  And I am
    one with my niece--in everything!"  The whole thing was quite regal
    in manner; it seemed to take me back to the days of the Pretender.

    It was not, however, a time for sentiment, but for action--we had met
    regarding the future, not the past; so I produced the short document
    I had already prepared.  On the strength of his steadfast declaration
    that he would accept the terms of the Will and the secret letters, I
    had got ready a formal acceptance.  When I had once again formally
    asked Mr. Sent Leger's wishes, and he had declared his wish to
    accept, I got in a couple of my clerks as witnesses.

    Then, having again asked him in their presence if it was his wish to
    declare acceptance of the conditions, the document was signed and
    witnessed, Sir Colin and I both appending our signatures to the
    Attestation.

    And so the first stage of Rupert Sent Leger's inheritance is
    completed.  The next step will not have to be undertaken on my part
    until the expiration of six months from his entry on his estate at
    Vissarion.  As he announces his intention of going within a
    fortnight, this will mean practically a little over six months from
    now.




BOOK II: VISSARION


_Letter from Rupert Sent Leger_, _Castle of Vissarion_, _the Spear of
Ivan_, _Land of the Blue Mountains_, _to Miss Janet MacKelpie_, _Croom
Castle_, _Ross-shire_, _N.B._

                                                       _January_ 23, 1907.

    MY DEAREST AUNT JANET,

    As you see, I am here at last.  Having got my formal duty done, as
    you made me promise--my letters reporting arrival to Sir Colin and
    Mr. Trent are lying sealed in front of me ready to post (for nothing
    shall go before yours)--I am free to speak to you.

    This is a most lovely place, and I hope you will like it.  I am quite
    sure you will.  We passed it in the steamer coming from Trieste to
    Durazzo.  I knew the locality from the chart, and it was pointed out
    to me by one of the officers with whom I had become quite friendly,
    and who kindly showed me interesting places whenever we got within
    sight of shore.  The Spear of Ivan, on which the Castle stands, is a
    headland running well out into the sea.  It is quite a peculiar
    place--a sort of headland on a headland, jutting out into a deep,
    wide bay, so that, though it is a promontory, it is as far away from
    the traffic of coast life as anything you can conceive.  The main
    promontory is the end of a range of mountains, and looms up vast,
    towering over everything, a mass of sapphire blue.  I can well
    understand how the country came to be called the "Land of the Blue
    Mountains," for it is all mountains, and they are all blue!  The
    coast-line is magnificent--what is called "iron-bound"--being all
    rocky; sometimes great frowning precipices; sometimes jutting spurs
    of rock; again little rocky islets, now and again clad with trees and
    verdure, at other places stark and bare.  Elsewhere are little rocky
    bays and indentations--always rock, and often with long, interesting
    caves.  Some of the shores of the bays are sandy, or else ridges of
    beautiful pebbles, where the waves make endless murmur.

    But of all the places I have seen--in this land or any other--the
    most absolutely beautiful is Vissarion.  It stands at the ultimate
    point of the promontory--I mean the little, or, rather, lesser
    promontory--that continues on the spur of the mountain range.  For
    the lesser promontory or extension of the mountain is in reality
    vast; the lowest bit of cliff along the sea-front is not less than a
    couple of hundred feet high.  That point of rock is really very
    peculiar.  I think Dame Nature must, in the early days of her
    housekeeping--or, rather, house-_building_--have intended to give her
    little child, man, a rudimentary lesson in self-protection.  It is
    just a natural bastion such as a titanic Vauban might have designed
    in primeval times.  So far as the Castle is concerned, it is alone
    visible from the sea.  Any enemy approaching could see only that
    frowning wall of black rock, of vast height and perpendicular
    steepness.  Even the old fortifications which crown it are not built,
    but cut in the solid rock.  A long narrow creek of very deep water,
    walled in by high, steep cliffs, runs in behind the Castle, bending
    north and west, making safe and secret anchorage.  Into the creek
    falls over a precipice a mountain-stream, which never fails in volume
    of water.  On the western shore of that creek is the Castle, a huge
    pile of buildings of every style of architecture, from the Twelfth
    century to where such things seemed to stop in this dear old-world
    land--about the time of Queen Elizabeth.  So it is pretty
    picturesque.  I can tell you.  When we got the first glimpse of the
    place from the steamer the officer, with whom I was on the bridge,
    pointed towards it and said:

    "That is where we saw the dead woman floating in a coffin."  That was
    rather interesting, so I asked him all about it.  He took from his
    pocket-book a cutting from an Italian paper, which he handed to me.
    As I can read and speak Italian fairly well, it was all right; but as
    you, my dear Aunt Janet, are not skilled in languages, and as I doubt
    if there is any assistance of the kind to be had at Croom, I do not
    send it.  But as I have heard that the item has been produced in the
    last number of _The Journal of Occultism_, you will be easily able to
    get it.  As he handed me the cutting he said: "I am Destilia!"  His
    story was so strange that I asked him a good many questions about it.
    He answered me quite frankly on every point, but always adhering
    stoutly to the main point--namely, that it was no phantom or mirage,
    no dream or imperfect vision in a fog.  "We were four in all who saw
    it," he said--"three from the bridge and the Englishman,
    Caulfield--from the bows--whose account exactly agreed with what we
    saw.  Captain Mirolani and Falamano and I were all awake and in good
    trim.  We looked with our night-glasses, which are more than usually
    powerful.  You know, we need good glasses for the east shore of the
    Adriatic and for among the islands to the south.  There was a full
    moon and a brilliant light.  Of course we were a little way off, for
    though the Spear of Ivan is in deep water, one has to be careful of
    currents, for it is in just such places that the dangerous currents
    run."  The agent of Lloyd's told me only a few weeks ago that it was
    only after a prolonged investigation of the tidal and sea currents
    that the house decided to except from ordinary sea risks losses due
    to a too close course by the Spear of Ivan.  When I tried to get a
    little more definite account of the coffin-boat and the dead lady
    that is given in _The Journal of Occultism_ he simply shrugged his
    shoulders.  "Signor, it is all," he said.  "That Englishman wrote
    everything after endless questioning."

    So you see, my dear, that our new home is not without superstitious
    interests of its own.  It is rather a nice idea, is it not, to have a
    dead woman cruising round our promontory in a coffin?  I doubt if
    even at Croom you can beat that.  "Makes the place kind of homey," as
    an American would say.  When you come, Aunt Janet, you will not feel
    lonesome, at any rate, and it will save us the trouble of importing
    some of your Highland ghosts to make you feel at home in the new
    land.  I don't know, but we might ask the stiff to come to tea with
    us.  Of course, it would be a late tea.  Somewhere between midnight
    and cock-crow would be about the etiquette of the thing, I fancy!

    But I must tell you all the realities of the Castle and around it.
    So I will write again within a day or two, and try to let you know
    enough to prepare you for coming here.  Till then adieu, my dear.

                                                               Your loving

    I hope I did not frighten you, dear Aunt Janet, by the yarn of the
    lady in the coffin.  But I know you are not afraid; you have told me
    too many weird stories for me to dread that.  Besides, you have
    Second Sight--latent, at all events.  However, there won't be any
    more ghosts, or about ghosts, in this letter.  I want to tell you all
    about our new home.  I am so glad you are coming out so soon; I am
    beginning to feel so lonesome--I walk about sometimes aimlessly, and
    find my thoughts drifting in such an odd way.  If I didn't know
    better, I might begin to think I was in love!  There is no one here
    to be in love with; so make your mind easy, Aunt Janet.  Not that you
    would be unhappy, I know, dear, if I _did_ fall in love.  I suppose I
    must marry some day.  It is a duty now, I know, when there is such an
    estate as Uncle Roger has left me.  And I know this: I shall never
    marry any woman unless I love her.  And I am right sure that if I do
    love her you will love her, too, Aunt Janet!  Won't you, dear?  It
    wouldn't be half a delight if you didn't.  It won't if you don't.
    There, now!

    But before I begin to describe Vissarion I shall throw a sop to you
    as a chatelaine; that may give you patience to read the rest.  The
    Castle needs a lot of things to make it comfortable--as you would
    consider it.  In fact, it is absolutely destitute of everything of a
    domestic nature.  Uncle Roger had it vetted on the defence side, and
    so far it could stand a siege.  But it couldn't cook a dinner or go
    through a spring-cleaning!  As you know, I am not much up in domestic
    matters, and so I cannot give you details; but you may take it that
    it wants everything.  I don't mean furniture, or silver, or even
    gold-plate, or works of art, for it is full of the most magnificent
    old things that you can imagine.  I think Uncle Roger must have been
    a collector, and gathered a lot of good things in all sorts of
    places, stored them for years, and then sent them here.  But as to
    glass, china, delft, all sorts of crockery, linen, household
    appliances and machinery, cooking utensils--except of the
    simplest--there are none.  I don't think Uncle Roger could have lived
    here more than on a temporary picnic.  So far as I only am concerned,
    I am all right; a gridiron and a saucepan are all _I_ want--and I can
    use them myself.  But, dear Aunt Janet, I don't want you to pig it.
    I would like you to have everything you can imagine, and all of the
    very best.  Cost doesn't count now for us, thanks to Uncle Roger; and
    so I want you to order all.  I know you, dear--being a woman--won't
    object to shopping.  But it will have to be wholesale.  This is an
    enormous place, and will swallow up all you can buy--like a
    quicksand.  Do as you like about choosing, but get all the help you
    can.  Don't be afraid of getting too much.  You can't, or of being
    idle when you are here.  I assure you that when you come there will
    be so much to do and so many things to think of that you will want to
    get away from it all.  And, besides, Aunt Janet, I hope you won't be
    too long.  Indeed, I don't wish to be selfish, but your boy is
    lonely, and wants you.  And when you get here you will be an EMPRESS.
    I don't altogether like doing so, lest I should offend a
    millionairess like you; but it may facilitate matters, and the way's
    of commerce are strict, though devious.  So I send you a cheque for
    1,000 pounds for the little things: and a letter to the bank to
    honour your own cheques for any amount I have got.

    I think, by the way, I should, if I were you, take or send out a few
    servants--not too many at first, only just enough to attend on our
    two selves.  You can arrange to send for any more you may want later.
    Engage them, and arrange for their being paid--when they are in our
    service we must treat them well--and then they can be at our call as
    you find that we want them.  I think you should secure, say, fifty or
    a hundred--'tis an awfu' big place, Aunt Janet!  And in the same way
    will you secure--and, of course, arrange for pay similarly--a hundred
    men, exclusive of any servants you think it well to have.  I should
    like the General, if he can give the time, to choose or pass them.  I
    want clansmen that I can depend on, if need be.  We are going to live
    in a country which is at present strange to us, and it is well to
    look things in the face.  I know Sir Colin will only have men who are
    a credit to Scotland and to Ross and to Croom--men who will impress
    the Blue Mountaineers.  I know they will take them to their
    hearts--certainly if any of them are bachelors the girls will!
    Forgive me!  But if we are to settle here, our followers will
    probably want to settle also.  Moreover, the Blue Mountaineers may
    want followers also!  And will want them to settle, too, and have
    successors!

    Now for the description of the place.  Well, I simply can't just now.
    It is all so wonderful and so beautiful.  The Castle--I have written
    so much already about other things that I really must keep the Castle
    for another letter!  Love to Sir Colin if he is at Croom.  And oh,
    dear Aunt Janet, how I wish that my dear mother was coming out!  It
    all seems so dark and empty without her.  How she would have enjoyed
    it!  How proud she would have been!  And, my dear, if she could be
    with us again, how grateful she would have been to you for all you
    have done for her boy!  As I am, believe me, most truly and sincerely
    and affectionately grateful.

                                                               Your loving
                                                                   RUPERT.

    MY DEAR AUNT JANET,

    Please read this as if it was a part of the letter I wrote yesterday.

    The Castle itself is so vast that I really can't describe it in
    detail.  So I am waiting till you come; and then you and I will go
    over it together and learn all that we can about it.  We shall take
    Rooke with us, and, as he is supposed to know every part of it, from
    the keep to the torture-chamber, we can spend a few days over it.  Of
    course, I have been over most of it, since I came--that, is, I went
    at various times to see different portions--the battlements, the
    bastions, the old guard-room, the hall, the chapel, the walls, the
    roof.  And I have been through some of the network of rock passages.
    Uncle Roger must have spent a mint of money on it, so far as I can
    see; and though I am not a soldier, I have been in so many places
    fortified in different ways that I am not entirely ignorant of the
    subject.  He has restored it in such an up-to-date way that it is
    practically impregnable to anything under big guns or a siege-train.
    He has gone so far as to have certain outworks and the keep covered
    with armoured plating of what looks like harveyized steel.  You will
    wonder when you see it.  But as yet I really know only a few rooms,
    and am familiar with only one--my own room.  The drawing-room--not
    the great hall, which is a vast place; the library--a magnificent
    one, but in sad disorder--we must get a librarian some day to put it
    in trim; and the drawing-room and boudoir and bedroom suite which I
    have selected for you, are all fine.  But my own room is what suits
    me best, though I do not think you would care for it for yourself.
    If you do, you shall have it.  It was Uncle Roger's own room when he
    stayed here; living in it for a few days served to give me more
    insight to his character--or rather to his mind--than I could have
    otherwise had.  It is just the kind of place I like myself; so,
    naturally, I understand the other chap who liked it too.  It is a
    fine big room, not quite within the Castle, but an outlying part of
    it.  It is not detached, or anything of that sort, but is a sort of
    garden-room built on to it.  There seems to have been always some
    sort of place where it is, for the passages and openings inside seem
    to accept or recognize it.  It can be shut off if necessary--it would
    be in case of attack--by a great slab of steel, just like the door of
    a safe, which slides from inside the wall, and can be operated from
    either inside or outside--if you know how.  That is from my room or
    from within the keep.  The mechanism is a secret, and no one but
    Rooke and I know it.  The room opens out through a great French
    window--the French window is modern, I take it, and was arranged by
    or for Uncle Roger; I think there must have been always a large
    opening there, for centuries at least--which opens on a wide terrace
    or balcony of white marble, extending right and left.  From this a
    white marble stair lies straight in front of the window, and leads
    down to the garden.  The balcony and staircase are quite ancient--of
    old Italian work, beautifully carved, and, of course, weather-worn
    through centuries.  There is just that little tinging of green here
    and there which makes all outdoor marble so charming.  It is hard to
    believe at times that it is a part of a fortified castle, it is so
    elegant and free and open.  The first glance of it would make a
    burglar's heart glad.  He would say to himself: "Here is the sort of
    crib I like when I'm on the job.  You can just walk in and out as you
    choose."  But, Aunt Janet, old Roger was cuter than any burglar.  He
    had the place so guarded that the burglar would have been a baffled
    burglar.  There are two steel shields which can slide out from the
    wall and lock into the other side right across the whole big window.
    One is a grille of steel bands that open out into diamond-shaped
    lozenges.  Nothing bigger than a kitten could get through; and yet
    you can see the garden and the mountains and the whole view--much the
    same as you ladies can see through your veils.  The other is a great
    sheet of steel, which slides out in a similar way in different
    grooves.  It is not, of course, so heavy and strong as the safe-door
    which covers the little opening in the main wall, but Rooke tells me
    it is proof against the heaviest rifle-hall.

    Having told you this, I must tell you, too, Aunt Janet, lest you
    should be made anxious by the _arriere-pensee_ of all these warlike
    measures of defence, that I always sleep at night with one of these
    iron screens across the window.  Of course, when I am awake I leave
    it open.  As yet I have tried only, but not used, the grille; and I
    don't think I shall ever use anything else, for it is a perfect
    guard.  If it should be tampered with from outside it would sound an
    alarm at the head of the bed, and the pressing of a button would roll
    out the solid steel screen in front of it.  As a matter of fact, I
    have been so used to the open that I don't feel comfortable shut in.
    I only close windows against cold or rain.  The weather here is
    delightful--as yet, at all events--but they tell me that the rainy
    season will be on us before very long.

    I think you will like my den, aunty dear, though it will doubtless be
    a worry to you to see it so untidy.  But that can't be helped.  I
    must be untidy _somewhere_; and it is best in my own den!

    Again I find my letter so long that I must cut it off now and go on
    again to-night.  So this must go as it stands.  I shall not cause you
    to wait to hear all I can tell you about our new home.

                                                               Your loving
                                                                   RUPERT.

    MY DEAR AUNT JANET,

    My den looks out, as I told you in my last letter, on the garden, or,
    to speak more accurately, on _one_ of the gardens, for there are
    acres of them.  This is the old one, which must be almost as old as
    the Castle itself, for it was within the defences in the old days of
    bows.  The wall that surrounds the inner portion of it has long ago
    been levelled, but sufficient remains at either end where it joined
    the outer defences to show the long casemates for the bowmen to shoot
    through and the raised stone gallery where they stood.  It is just
    the same kind of building as the stone-work of the sentry's walk on
    the roof and of the great old guard-room under it.

    But whatever the garden may have been, and no matter how it was
    guarded, it is a most lovely place.  There are whole sections of
    garden here of various styles--Greek, Italian, French, German, Dutch,
    British, Spanish, African, Moorish--all the older nationalities.  I
    am going to have a new one laid out for you--a Japanese garden.  I
    have sent to the great gardener of Japan, Minaro, to make the plans
    for it, and to come over with workmen to carry it out.  He is to
    bring trees and shrubs and flowers and stone-work, and everything
    that can be required; and you shall superintend the finishing, if not
    the doing, of it yourself.  We have such a fine head of water here,
    and the climate is, they tell me, usually so lovely that we can do
    anything in the gardening way.  If it should ever turn out that the
    climate does not suit, we shall put a great high glass roof over it,
    and _make_ a suitable climate.

    This garden in front of my room is the old Italian garden.  It must
    have been done with extraordinary taste and care, for there is not a
    bit of it which is not rarely beautiful.  Sir Thomas Browne himself,
    for all his _Quincunx_, would have been delighted with it, and have
    found material for another "Garden of Cyrus."  It is so big that
    there are endless "episodes" of garden beauty I think all Italy must
    have been ransacked in old times for garden stone-work of exceptional
    beauty; and these treasures have been put together by some
    master-hand.  Even the formal borders of the walks are of old porous
    stone, which takes the weather-staining so beautifully, and are
    carved in endless variety.  Now that the gardens have been so long
    neglected or left in abeyance, the green staining has become perfect.
    Though the stone-work is itself intact, it has all the picturesque
    effect of the wear and ruin wrought by many centuries.  I am having
    it kept for you just as it is, except that I have had the weeds and
    undergrowth cleared away so that its beauties might be visible.

    But it is not merely the architect work of the garden that is so
    beautiful, nor is the assembling there of the manifold wealth of
    floral beauty--there is the beauty that Nature creates by the hand of
    her servant, Time.  You see, Aunt Janet, how the beautiful garden
    inspires a danger-hardened old tramp like me to high-grade sentiments
    of poetic fancy!  Not only have limestone and sandstone, and even
    marble, grown green in time, but even the shrubs planted and then
    neglected have developed new kinds of beauty of their own.  In some
    far-distant time some master-gardener of the Vissarions has tried to
    realize an idea--that of tiny plants that would grow just a little
    higher than the flowers, so that the effect of an uneven floral
    surface would be achieved without any hiding of anything in the
    garden seen from anywhere.  This is only my reading of what has been
    from the effect of what is!  In the long period of neglect the shrubs
    have outlived the flowers.  Nature has been doing her own work all
    the time in enforcing the survival of the fittest.  The shrubs have
    grown and grown, and have overtopped flower and weed, according to
    their inherent varieties of stature; to the effect that now you see
    irregularly scattered through the garden quite a number--for it is a
    big place--of vegetable products which from a landscape standpoint
    have something of the general effect of statues without the cramping
    feeling of detail.  Whoever it was that laid out that part of the
    garden or made the choice of items, must have taken pains to get
    strange specimens, for all those taller shrubs are in special
    colours, mostly yellow or white--white cypress, white holly, yellow
    yew, grey-golden box, silver juniper, variegated maple, spiraea, and
    numbers of dwarf shrubs whose names I don't know.  I only know that
    when the moon shines--and this, my dear Aunt Janet, is the very land
    of moonlight itself!--they all look ghastly pale.  The effect is
    weird to the last degree, and I am sure that you will enjoy it.  For
    myself, as you know, uncanny things hold no fear.  I suppose it is
    that I have been up against so many different kinds of fears, or,
    rather, of things which for most people have terrors of their own,
    that I have come to have a contempt--not an active contempt, you
    know, but a tolerative contempt--for the whole family of them.  And
    you, too, will enjoy yourself here famously, I know.  You'll have to
    collect all the stories of such matters in our new world and make a
    new book of facts for the Psychical Research Society.  It will be
    nice to see your own name on a title-page, won't it, Aunt Janet?

    MY DEAR AUNT JANET,

    I stopped writing last night--do you know why?  Because I wanted to
    write more!  This sounds a paradox, but it is true.  The fact is
    that, as I go on telling you of this delightful place, I keep finding
    out new beauties myself.  Broadly speaking, it _is all_ beautiful.
    In the long view or the little view--as the telescope or the
    microscope directs--it is all the same.  Your eye can turn on nothing
    that does not entrance you.  I was yesterday roaming about the upper
    part of time Castle, and came across some delightful nooks, which at
    once I became fond of, and already like them as if I had known them
    all my life.  I felt at first a sense of greediness when I had
    appropriated to myself several rooms in different places--I who have
    never in my life had more than one room which I could call my
    own--and that only for a time!  But when I slept on it the feeling
    changed, and its aspect is now not half bad.  It is now under another
    classification--under a much more important label--_proprietorship_.
    If I were writing philosophy, I should here put in a cynical remark:

    "Selfishness is an appanage of poverty.  It might appear in the
    stud-book as by 'Morals' out of 'Wants.'"

    I have now three bedrooms arranged as my own particular dens.  One of
    the other two was also a choice of Uncle Roger's.  It is at the top
    of one of the towers to the extreme east, and from it I can catch the
    first ray of light over the mountains.  I slept in it last night, and
    when I woke, as in my travelling I was accustomed to do, at dawn, I
    saw from my bed through an open window--a small window, for it is in
    a fortress tower--the whole great expanse to the east.  Not far off,
    and springing from the summit of a great ruin, where long ago a seed
    had fallen, rose a great silver-birch, and the half-transparent,
    drooping branches and hanging clusters of leaf broke the outline of
    the grey hills beyond, for the hills were, for a wonder, grey instead
    of blue.  There was a mackerel sky, with the clouds dropping on the
    mountain-tops till you could hardly say which was which.  It was a
    mackerel sky of a very bold and extraordinary kind--not a dish of
    mackerel, but a world of mackerel!  The mountains are certainly most
    lovely.  In this clear air they usually seem close at hand.  It was
    only this morning, with the faint glimpse of the dawn whilst the
    night clouds were still unpierced by the sunlight, that I seemed to
    realize their greatness.  I have seen the same enlightening effect of
    aerial perspective a few times before--in Colorado, in Upper India,
    in Thibet, and in the uplands amongst the Andes.

    There is certainly something in looking at things from above which
    tends to raise one's own self-esteem.  From the height, inequalities
    simply disappear.  This I have often felt on a big scale when
    ballooning, or, better still, from an aeroplane.  Even here from the
    tower the outlook is somehow quite different from below.  One
    realizes the place and all around it, not in detail, but as a whole.
    I shall certainly sleep up here occasionally, when you have come and
    we have settled down to our life as it is to be.  I shall live in my
    own room downstairs, where I can have the intimacy of the garden.
    But I shall appreciate it all the more from now and again losing the
    sense of intimacy for a while, and surveying it without the sense of
    one's own self-importance.

    I hope you have started on that matter of the servants.  For myself,
    I don't care a button whether or not there are any servants at all;
    but I know well that you won't come till you have made your
    arrangements regarding them!  Another thing, Aunt Janet.  You must
    not be killed with work here, and it is all so vast . . . Why can't
    you get some sort of secretary who will write your letters and do all
    that sort of thing for you?  I know you won't have a man secretary;
    but there are lots of women now who can write shorthand and
    typewrite.  You could doubtless get one in the clan--someone with a
    desire to better herself.  I know you would make her happy here.  If
    she is not too young, all the better; she will have learned to hold
    her tongue and mind her own business, and not be too inquisitive.
    That would be a nuisance when we are finding our way about in a new
    country and trying to reconcile all sorts of opposites in a whole new
    country with new people, whom at first we shan't understand, and who
    certainly won't understand us; where every man carries a gun with as
    little thought of it as he has of buttons!  Good-bye for a while.

                                                               Your loving
                                                                   RUPERT.

    I am back in my own room again.  Already it seems to me that to get
    here again is like coming home.  I have been going about for the last
    few days amongst the mountaineers and trying to make their
    acquaintance.  It is a tough job; and I can see that there will be
    nothing but to stick to it.  They are in reality the most primitive
    people I ever met--the most fixed to their own ideas, which belong to
    centuries back.  I can understand now what people were like in
    England--not in Queen Elizabeth's time, for that was civilized time,
    but in the time of Coeur-de-Lion, or even earlier--and all the time
    with the most absolute mastery of weapons of precision.  Every man
    carries a rifle--and knows how to use it, too.  I do believe they
    would rather go without their clothes than their guns if they had to
    choose between them.  They also carry a handjar, which used to be
    their national weapon.  It is a sort of heavy, straight cutlass, and
    they are so expert with it as well as so strong that it is as facile
    in the hands of a Blue Mountaineer as is a foil in the hands of a
    Persian _maitre d'armes_.  They are so proud and reserved that they
    make one feel quite small, and an "outsider" as well.  I can see
    quite well that they rather resent my being here at all.  It is not
    personal, for when alone with me they are genial, almost brotherly;
    but the moment a few of them get together they are like a sort of
    jury, with me as the criminal before them.  It is an odd situation,
    and quite new to me.  I am pretty well accustomed to all sorts of
    people, from cannibals to Mahatmas, but I'm blessed if I ever struck
    such a type as this--so proud, so haughty, so reserved, so distant,
    so absolutely fearless, so honourable, so hospitable.  Uncle Roger's
    head was level when he chose them out as a people to live amongst.
    Do you know, Aunt Janet, I can't help feeling that they are very much
    like your own Highlanders--only more so.  I'm sure of one thing: that
    in the end we shall get on capitally together.  But it will be a slow
    job, and will need a lot of patience.  I have a feeling in my bones
    that when they know me better they will be very loyal and very true;
    and I am not a hair's-breadth afraid of them or anything they shall
    or might do.  That is, of course, if I live long enough for them to
    have time to know me.  Anything may happen with such an indomitable,
    proud people to whom pride is more than victuals.  After all, it only
    needs one man out of a crowd to have a wrong idea or to make a
    mistake as to one's motive--and there you are.  But it will be all
    right that way, I am sure.  I am come here to stay, as Uncle Roger
    wished.  And stay I shall even if it has to be in a little bed of my
    own beyond the garden--seven feet odd long, and not too narrow--or
    else a stone-box of equal proportions in the vaults of St. Sava's
    Church across the Creek--the old burial-place of the Vissarions and
    other noble people for a good many centuries back . . .

    I have been reading over this letter, dear Aunt Janet, and I am
    afraid the record is rather an alarming one.  But don't you go
    building up superstitious horrors or fears on it.  Honestly, I am
    only joking about death--a thing to which I have been rather prone
    for a good many years back.  Not in very good taste, I suppose, but
    certainly very useful when the old man with the black wings goes
    flying about you day and night in strange places, sometimes visible
    and at others invisible.  But you can always hear wings, especially
    in the dark, when you cannot see them.  _You_ know that, Aunt Janet,
    who come of a race of warriors, and who have special sight behind or
    through the black curtain.

    Honestly, I am in no whit afraid of the Blue Mountaineers, nor have I
    a doubt of them.  I love them already for their splendid qualities,
    and I am prepared to love them for themselves.  I feel, too, that
    they will love me (and incidentally they are sure to love you).  I
    have a sort of undercurrent of thought that there is something in
    their minds concerning me--something not painful, but disturbing;
    something that has a base in the past; something that has hope in it
    and possible pride, and not a little respect.  As yet they can have
    had no opportunity of forming such impression from seeing me or from
    any thing I have done.  Of course, it may be that, although they are
    fine, tall, stalwart men, I am still a head and shoulders over the
    tallest of them that I have yet seen.  I catch their eyes looking up
    at me as though they were measuring me, even when they are keeping
    away from me, or, rather, keeping me from them at arm's length.  I
    suppose I shall understand what it all means some day.  In the
    meantime there is nothing to do but to go on my own way--which is
    Uncle Roger's--and wait and be patient and just.  I have learned the
    value of that, any way, in my life amongst strange peoples.
    Good-night.

                                                               Your loving
                                                                   RUPERT.

    MY DEAR AUNT JANET,

    I am more than rejoiced to hear that you are coming here so soon.
    This isolation is, I think, getting on my nerves.  I thought for a
    while last night that I was getting on, but the reaction came all too
    soon.  I was in my room in the east turret, the room on the
    _corbeille_, and saw here and there men passing silently and swiftly
    between the trees as though in secret.  By-and-by I located their
    meeting-place, which was in a hollow in the midst of the wood just
    outside the "natural" garden, as the map or plan of the castle calls
    it.  I stalked that place for all I was worth, and suddenly walked
    straight into the midst of them.  There were perhaps two or three
    hundred gathered, about the very finest lot of men I ever saw in my
    life.  It was in its way quite an experience, and one not likely to
    be repeated, for, as I told you, in this country every man carries a
    rifle, and knows how to use it.  I do not think I have seen a single
    man (or married man either) without his rifle since I came here.  I
    wonder if they take them with them to bed!  Well, the instant after I
    stood amongst them every rifle in the place was aimed straight at me.
    Don't be alarmed, Aunt Janet; they did not fire at me.  If they had I
    should not be writing to you now.  I should be in that little bit of
    real estate or the stone box, and about as full of lead as I could
    hold.  Ordinarily, I take it, they would have fired on the instant;
    that is the etiquette here.  But this time they--all separately but
    all together--made a new rule.  No one said a word or, so far as I
    could see, made a movement.  Here came in my own experience.  I had
    been more than once in a tight place of something of the same kind,
    so I simply behaved in the most natural way I could.  I felt
    conscious--it was all in a flash, remember--that if I showed fear or
    cause for fear, or even acknowledged danger by so much as even
    holding up my hands, I should have drawn all the fire.  They all
    remained stock-still, as though they had been turned into stone, for
    several seconds.  Then a queer kind of look flashed round them like
    wind over corn--something like the surprise one shows unconsciously
    on waking in a strange place.  A second after they each dropped the
    rifle to the hollow of his arm and stood ready for anything.  It was
    all as regular and quick and simultaneous as a salute at St. James's
    Palace.

    Happily I had no arms of any kind with me, so that there could be no
    complication.  I am rather a quick hand myself when there is any
    shooting to be done.  However, there was no trouble here, but the
    contrary; the Blue Mountaineers--it sounds like a new sort of Bond
    Street band, doesn't it?--treated me in quite a different way than
    they did when I first met them.  They were amazingly civil, almost
    deferential.  But, all time same, they were more distant than ever,
    and all the time I was there I could get not a whit closer to them.
    They seemed in a sort of way to be afraid or in awe of me.  No doubt
    that will soon pass away, and when we know one another better we
    shall become close friends.  They are too fine fellows not to be
    worth a little waiting for.  (That sentence, by the way, is a pretty
    bad sentence!  In old days you would have slippered me for it!)  Your
    journey is all arranged, and I hope you will be comfortable.  Rooke
    will meet you at Liverpool Street and look after everything.

    I shan't write again, but when we meet at Fiume I shall begin to tell
    you all the rest.  Till then, good-bye.  A good journey to you, and a
    happy meeting to us both.

                                                                   RUPERT.

_Letter from Janet MacKelpie_, _Vissarion_, _to Sir Colin MacKelpie_,
_United Service Club_, _London_.

                                                      _February_ 28, 1907.

    DEAREST UNCLE,

    I had a very comfortable journey all across Europe.  Rupert wrote to
    me some time ago to say that when I got to Vissarion I should be an
    Empress, and he certainly took care that on the way here I should be
    treated like one.  Rooke, who seems a wonderful old man, was in the
    next compartment to that reserved for me.  At Harwich he had
    everything arranged perfectly, and so right on to Fiume.  Everywhere
    there were attentive officials waiting.  I had a carriage all to
    myself, which I joined at Antwerp--a whole carriage with a suite of
    rooms, dining-room, drawing-room, bedroom, even bath-room.  There was
    a cook with a kitchen of his own on board, a real chef like a French
    nobleman in disguise.  There were also a waiter and a servant-maid.
    My own maid Maggie was quite awed at first.  We were as far as
    Cologne before she summoned up courage to order them about.  Whenever
    we stopped Rooke was on the platform with local officials, and kept
    the door of my carriage like a sentry on duty.

    At Fiume, when the train slowed down, I saw Rupert waiting on the
    platform.  He looked magnificent, towering over everybody there like
    a giant.  He is in perfect health, and seemed glad to see me.  He
    took me off at once on an automobile to a quay where an electric
    launch was waiting.  This took us on board a beautiful big
    steam-yacht, which was waiting with full steam up and--how he got
    there I don't know--Rooke waiting at the gangway.

    I had another suite all to myself.  Rupert and I had dinner
    together--I think the finest dinner I ever sat down to.  This was
    very nice of Rupert, for it was all for me.  He himself only ate a
    piece of steak and drank a glass of water.  I went to bed early, for,
    despite the luxury of the journey, I was very tired.

    I awoke in the grey of the morning, and came on deck.  We were close
    to the coast.  Rupert was on the bridge with the Captain, and Rooke
    was acting as pilot.  When Rupert saw me, he ran down the ladder and
    took me up on the bridge.  He left me there while he ran down again
    and brought me up a lovely fur cloak which I had never seen.  He put
    it on me and kissed me.  He is the tenderest-hearted boy in the
    world, as well as the best and bravest!  He made me take his arm
    whilst he pointed out Vissarion, towards which we were steering.  It
    is the most lovely place I ever saw.  I won't stop to describe it
    now, for it will be better that you see it for yourself and enjoy it
    all fresh as I did.

    The Castle is an immense place.  You had better ship off, as soon as
    all is ready here and you can arrange it, the servants whom I
    engaged; and I am not sure that we shall not want as many more.
    There has hardly been a mop or broom on the place for centuries, and
    I doubt if it ever had a thorough good cleaning all over since it was
    built.  And, do you know, Uncle, that it might be well to double that
    little army of yours that you are arranging for Rupert?  Indeed, the
    boy told me himself that he was going to write to you about it.  I
    think old Lachlan and his wife, Sandy's Mary, had better be in charge
    of the maids when they come over.  A lot of lassies like yon will be
    iller to keep together than a flock of sheep.  So it will be wise to
    have authority over them, especially as none of them speaks a word of
    foreign tongues.  Rooke--you saw him at the station at Liverpool
    Street--will, if he be available, go over to bring the whole body
    here.  He has offered to do it if I should wish.  And, by the way, I
    think it will be well, when the time comes for their departure, if
    not only the lassies, but Lachlan and Sandy's Mary, too, will call
    him _Mister_ Rooke.  He is a very important person indeed here.  He
    is, in fact, a sort of Master of the Castle, and though he is very
    self-suppressing, is a man of rarely fine qualities.  Also it will be
    well to keep authority.  When your clansmen come over, he will have
    charge of them, too.  Dear me!  I find I have written such a long
    letter, I must stop and get to work.  I shall write again.

                                                    Your very affectionate
                                                                    JANET.

_From the Same to the Same_.

    DEAREST UNCLE,

    All goes well here, and as there is no news, I only write because you
    are a dear, and I want to thank you for all the trouble you have
    taken for me--and for Rupert.  I think we had better wait awhile
    before bringing out the servants.  Rooke is away on some business for
    Rupert, and will not be back for some time; Rupert thinks it may be a
    couple of months.  There is no one else that he could send to take
    charge of the party from home, and I don't like the idea of all those
    lassies coming out without an escort.  Even Lachlan and Sandy's Mary
    are ignorant of foreign languages and foreign ways.  But as soon as
    Rooke returns we can have them all out.  I dare say you will have
    some of your clansmen ready by then, and I think the poor girls, who
    may feel a bit strange in a new country like this, where the ways are
    so different from ours, will feel easier when they know that there
    are some of their own mankind near them.  Perhaps it might be well
    that those of them who are engaged to each other--I know there are
    some--should marry before they come out here.  It will be more
    convenient in many ways, and will save lodgment, and, besides, these
    Blue Mountaineers are very handsome men.  Good-night.

                                                                    JANET.

    MY DEAR JANET,

    I have duly received both your letters, and am delighted to find you
    are so well pleased with your new home.  It must certainly be a very
    lovely and unique place, and I am myself longing to see it.  I came
    up here three days ago, and am, as usual, feeling all the better for
    a breath of my native air.  Time goes on, my dear, and I am beginning
    to feel not so young as I was.  Tell Rupert that the men are all fit,
    and longing to get out to him.  They are certainly a fine lot of men.
    I don't think I ever saw a finer.  I have had them drilled and
    trained as soldiers, and, in addition, have had them taught a lot of
    trades just as they selected themselves.  So he shall have nigh him
    men who can turn their hands to anything--not, of course, that they
    all know every trade, but amongst them there is someone who can do
    whatever may be required.  There are blacksmiths, carpenters,
    farriers, saddle-makers, gardeners, plumbers, cutlers, gunsmiths, so,
    as they all are farmers by origin and sportsmen by practice, they
    will make a rare household body of men.  They are nearly all
    first-class shots, and I am having them practise with revolvers.
    They are being taught fencing and broadsword and ju-jitsu; I have
    organized them in military form, with their own sergeants and
    corporals.  This morning I had an inspection, and I assure you, my
    dear, they could give points to the Household troop in matters of
    drill.  I tell you I am proud of my clansmen!

    I think you are quite wise about waiting to bring out the lassies,
    and wiser still about the marrying.  I dare say there will be more
    marrying when they all get settled in a foreign country.  I shall be
    glad of it, for as Rupert is going to settle there, it will be good
    for him to have round him a little colony of his own people.  And it
    will be good for them, too, for I know he will be good to them--as
    you will, my dear.  The hills are barren here, and life is hard, and
    each year there is more and more demand for crofts, and sooner or
    later our people must thin out.  And mayhap our little settlement of
    MacKelpie clan away beyond the frontiers of the Empire may be some
    service to the nation and the King.  But this is a dream!  I see that
    here I am beginning to realise in myself one part of Isaiah's
    prophecy:

    "Your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream
    dreams."

    By the way, my dear, talking about dreams, I am sending you out some
    boxes of books which were in your rooms.  They are nearly all on odd
    subjects that _we_ understand--Second Sight, Ghosts, Dreams (that was
    what brought the matter to my mind just now), superstitions,
    Vampires, Wehr-Wolves, and all such uncanny folk and things.  I
    looked over some of these books, and found your marks and underlining
    and comments, so I fancy you will miss them in your new home.  You
    will, I am sure, feel more at ease with such old friends close to
    you.  I have taken the names and sent the list to London, so that
    when you pay me a visit again you will be at home in all ways.  If
    you come to me altogether, you will be more welcome still--if
    possible.  But I am sure that Rupert, who I know loves you very much,
    will try to make you so happy that you will not want to leave him.
    So I will have to come out often to see you both, even at the cost of
    leaving Croom for so long.  Strange, is it not? that now, when,
    through Roger Melton's more than kind remembrance of me, I am able to
    go where I will and do what I will, I want more and more to remain at
    home by my own ingle.  I don't think that anyone but you or Rupert
    could get me away from it.  I am working very hard at my little
    regiment, as I call it.  They are simply fine, and will, I am sure,
    do us credit.  The uniforms are all made, and well made, too.  There
    is not a man of them that does not look like an officer.  I tell you,
    Janet, that when we turn out the Vissarion Guard we shall feel proud
    of them.  I dare say that a couple of months will do all that can be
    done here.  I shall come out with them myself.  Rupert writes me that
    he thinks it will be more comfortable to come out direct in a ship of
    our own.  So when I go up to London in a few weeks' time I shall see
    about chartering a suitable vessel.  It will certainly save a lot of
    trouble to us and anxiety to our people.  Would it not be well when I
    am getting the ship, if I charter one big enough to take out all your
    lassies, too?  It is not as if they were strangers.  After all, my
    dear, soldiers are soldiers and lassies are lassies.  But these are
    all kinsfolk, as well as clansmen and clanswomen, and I, their Chief,
    shall be there.  Let me know your views and wishes in this respect.
    Mr. Trent, whom I saw before leaving London, asked me to "convey to
    you his most respectful remembrances"--these were his very words, and
    here they are.  Trent is a nice fellow, and I like him.  He has
    promised to pay me a visit here before the month is up, and I look
    forward to our both enjoying ourselves.

    Good-bye, my dear, and the Lord watch over you and our dear boy.

                                                  Your affectionate Uncle,
                                                COLIN ALEXANDER MACKELPIE.




BOOK III: THE COMING OF THE LADY


Rupert Sent Leger's Journal.


                                                          _April_ 3, 1907.

I have waited till now--well into midday--before beginning to set down
the details of the strange episode of last night.  I have spoken with
persons whom I know to be of normal type.  I have breakfasted, as usual
heartily, and have every reason to consider myself in perfect health and
sanity.  So that the record following may be regarded as not only true in
substance, but exact as to details.  I have investigated and reported on
too many cases for the Psychical Research Society to be ignorant of the
necessity for absolute accuracy in such matters of even the minutest
detail.

Yesterday was Tuesday, the second day of April, 1907.  I passed a day of
interest, with its fair amount of work of varying kinds.  Aunt Janet and
I lunched together, had a stroll round the gardens after tea--especially
examining the site for the new Japanese garden, which we shall call
"Janet's Garden."  We went in mackintoshes, for the rainy season is in
its full, the only sign of its not being a repetition of the Deluge being
that breaks in the continuance are beginning.  They are short at present
but will doubtless enlarge themselves as the season comes towards an end.
We dined together at seven.  After dinner I had a cigar, and then joined
Aunt Janet for an hour in her drawing-room.  I left her at half-past ten,
when I went to my own room and wrote some letters.  At ten minutes past
eleven I wound my watch, so I know the time accurately.  Having prepared
for bed, I drew back the heavy curtain in front of my window, which opens
on the marble steps into the Italian garden.  I had put out my light
before drawing back the curtain, for I wanted to have a look at the scene
before turning in.  Aunt Janet has always had an old-fashioned idea of
the need (or propriety, I hardly know which) of keeping windows closed
and curtains drawn.  I am gradually getting her to leave my room alone in
this respect, but at present the change is in its fitful stage, and of
course I must not hurry matters or be too persistent, as it would hurt
her feelings.  This night was one of those under the old regime.  It was
a delight to look out, for the scene was perfect of its own kind.  The
long spell of rain--the ceaseless downpour which had for the time flooded
everywhere--had passed, and water in abnormal places rather trickled than
ran.  We were now beginning to be in the sloppy rather than the deluged
stage.  There was plenty of light to see by, for the moon had begun to
show out fitfully through the masses of flying clouds.  The uncertain
light made weird shadows with the shrubs and statues in the garden.  The
long straight walk which leads from the marble steps is strewn with fine
sand white from the quartz strand in the nook to the south of the Castle.
Tall shrubs of white holly, yew, juniper, cypress, and variegated maple
and spiraea, which stood at intervals along the walk and its branches,
appeared ghost-like in the fitful moonlight.  The many vases and statues
and urns, always like phantoms in a half-light, were more than ever
weird.  Last night the moonlight was unusually effective, and showed not
only the gardens down to the defending wall, but the deep gloom of the
great forest-trees beyond; and beyond that, again, to where the mountain
chain began, the forest running up their silvered slopes flamelike in
form, deviated here and there by great crags and the outcropping rocky
sinews of the vast mountains.

Whilst I was looking at this lovely prospect, I thought I saw something
white flit, like a modified white flash, at odd moments from one to
another of the shrubs or statues--anything which would afford cover from
observation.  At first I was not sure whether I really saw anything or
did not.  This was in itself a little disturbing to me, for I have been
so long trained to minute observation of facts surrounding me, on which
often depend not only my own life, but the lives of others, that I have
become accustomed to trust my eyes; and anything creating the faintest
doubt in this respect is a cause of more or less anxiety to me.  Now,
however, that my attention was called to myself, I looked more keenly,
and in a very short time was satisfied that something was
moving--something clad in white.  It was natural enough that my thoughts
should tend towards something uncanny--the belief that this place is
haunted, conveyed in a thousand ways of speech and inference.  Aunt
Janet's eerie beliefs, fortified by her books on occult subjects--and of
late, in our isolation from the rest of the world, the subject of daily
conversations--helped to this end.  No wonder, then, that, fully awake
and with senses all on edge, I waited for some further manifestation from
this ghostly visitor--as in my mind I took it to be.  It must surely be a
ghost or spiritual manifestation of some kind which moved in this silent
way.  In order to see and hear better, I softly moved back the folding
grille, opened the French window, and stepped out, bare-footed and
pyjama-clad as I was, on the marble terrace.  How cold the wet marble
was!  How heavy smelled the rain-laden garden!  It was as though the
night and the damp, and even the moonlight, were drawing the aroma from
all the flowers that blossomed.  The whole night seemed to exhale heavy,
half-intoxicating odours!  I stood at the head of the marble steps, and
all immediately before me was ghostly in the extreme--the white marble
terrace and steps, the white walks of quartz-sand glistening under the
fitful moonlight; the shrubs of white or pale green or yellow,--all
looking dim and ghostly in the glamorous light; the white statues and
vases.  And amongst them, still flitting noiselessly, that mysterious
elusive figure which I could not say was based on fact or imagination.  I
held my breath, listening intently for every sound; but sound there was
none, save those of the night and its denizens.  Owls hooted in the
forest; bats, taking advantage of the cessation of the rain, flitted
about silently, like shadows in the air.  But there was no more sign of
moving ghost or phantom, or whatever I had seen might have been--if,
indeed, there had been anything except imagination.

So, after waiting awhile, I returned to my room, closed the window, drew
the grille across again, and dragged the heavy curtain before the
opening; then, having extinguished my candles, went to bed in the dark.
In a few minutes I must have been asleep.

"What was that?"  I almost heard the words of my own thought as I sat up
in bed wide awake.  To memory rather than present hearing the disturbing
sound had seemed like the faint tapping at the window.  For some seconds
I listened, mechanically but intently, with bated breath and that quick
beating of the heart which in a timorous person speaks for fear, and for
expectation in another.  In the stillness the sound came again--this time
a very, very faint but unmistakable tapping at the glass door.

I jumped up, drew back the curtain, and for a moment stood appalled.

There, outside on the balcony, in the now brilliant moonlight, stood a
woman, wrapped in white grave-clothes saturated with water, which dripped
on the marble floor, making a pool which trickled slowly down the wet
steps.  Attitude and dress and circumstance all conveyed the idea that,
though she moved and spoke, she was not quick, but dead.  She was young
and very beautiful, but pale, like the grey pallor of death.  Through the
still white of her face, which made her look as cold as the wet marble
she stood on, her dark eyes seemed to gleam with a strange but enticing
lustre.  Even in the unsearching moonlight, which is after all rather
deceptive than illuminative, I could not but notice one rare quality of
her eyes.  Each had some quality of refraction which made it look as
though it contained a star.  At every movement she made, the stars
exhibited new beauties, of more rare and radiant force.  She looked at me
imploringly as the heavy curtain rolled back, and in eloquent gestures
implored me to admit her.  Instinctively I obeyed; I rolled back the
steel grille, and threw open the French window.  I noticed that she
shivered and trembled as the glass door fell open.  Indeed, she seemed so
overcome with cold as to seem almost unable to move.  In the sense of her
helplessness all idea of the strangeness of the situation entirely
disappeared.  It was not as if my first idea of death taken from her
cerements was negatived.  It was simply that I did not think of it at
all; I was content to accept things as they were--she was a woman, and in
some dreadful trouble; that was enough.

I am thus particular about my own emotions, as I may have to refer to
them again in matters of comprehension or comparison.  The whole thing is
so vastly strange and abnormal that the least thing may afterwards give
some guiding light or clue to something otherwise not understandable.  I
have always found that in recondite matters first impressions are of more
real value than later conclusions.  We humans place far too little
reliance on instinct as against reason; and yet instinct is the great
gift of Nature to all animals for their protection and the fulfilment of
their functions generally.

When I stepped out on the balcony, not thinking of my costume, I found
that the woman was benumbed and hardly able to move.  Even when I asked
her to enter, and supplemented my words with gestures in case she should
not understand my language, she stood stock-still, only rocking slightly
to and fro as though she had just strength enough left to balance herself
on her feet.  I was afraid, from the condition in which she was, that she
might drop down dead at any moment.  So I took her by the hand to lead
her in.  But she seemed too weak to even make the attempt.  When I pulled
her slightly forward, thinking to help her, she tottered, and would have
fallen had I not caught her in my arms.  Then, half lifting her, I moved
her forwards.  Her feet, relieved of her weight, now seemed able to make
the necessary effort; and so, I almost carrying her, we moved into the
room.  She was at the very end of her strength; I had to lift her over
the sill.  In obedience to her motion, I closed the French window and
bolted it.  I supposed the warmth of the room--though cool, it was warmer
than the damp air without--affected her quickly, for on the instant she
seemed to begin to recover herself.  In a few seconds, as though she had
reacquired her strength, she herself pulled the heavy curtain across the
window.  This left us in darkness, through which I heard her say in
English:

"Light.  Get a light!"

I found matches, and at once lit a candle.  As the wick flared, she moved
over to the door of the room, and tried if the lock and bolt were
fastened.  Satisfied as to this, she moved towards me, her wet shroud
leaving a trail of moisture on the green carpet.  By this time the wax of
the candle had melted sufficiently to let me see her clearly.  She was
shaking and quivering as though in an ague; she drew the wet shroud
around her piteously.  Instinctively I spoke:

"Can I do anything for you?"

She answered, still in English, and in a voice of thrilling, almost
piercing sweetness, which seemed somehow to go straight to my heart, and
affected me strangely: "Give me warmth."

I hurried to the fireplace.  It was empty; there was no fire laid.  I
turned to her, and said:

"Wait just a few minutes here.  I shall call someone, and get help--and
fire."

Her voice seemed to ring with intensity as she answered without a pause:

"No, no!  Rather would I be"--here she hesitated for an instant, but as
she caught sight of her cerements went on hurriedly--"as I am.  I trust
you--not others; and you must not betray my trust."  Almost instantly she
fell into a frightful fit of shivering, drawing again her death-clothes
close to her, so piteously that it wrung my heart.  I suppose I am a
practical man.  At any rate, I am accustomed to action.  I took from its
place beside my bed a thick Jaeger dressing-gown of dark brown--it was,
of course, of extra length--and held it out to her as I said:

"Put that on.  It is the only warm thing here which would be suitable.
Stay; you must remove that wet--wet"--I stumbled about for a word that
would not be offensive--"that frock--dress--costume--whatever it is."  I
pointed to where, in the corner of the room, stood a chintz-covered
folding-screen which fences in my cold sponge bath, which is laid ready
for me overnight, as I am an early riser.

She bowed gravely, and taking the dressing-gown in a long, white,
finely-shaped hand, bore it behind the screen.  There was a slight
rustle, and then a hollow "flop" as the wet garment fell on the floor;
more rustling and rubbing, and a minute later she emerged wrapped from
head to foot in the long Jaeger garment, which trailed on the floor
behind her, though she was a tall woman.  She was still shivering
painfully, however.  I took a flask of brandy and a glass from a
cupboard, and offered her some; but with a motion of her hand she refused
it, though she moaned grievously.

"Oh, I am so cold--so cold!"  Her teeth were chattering.  I was pained at
her sad condition, and said despairingly, for I was at my wits' end to
know what to do:

"Tell me anything that I can do to help you, and I will do it.  I may not
call help; there is no fire--nothing to make it with; you will not take
some brandy.  What on earth can I do to give you warmth?"

Her answer certainly surprised me when it came, though it was practical
enough--so practical that I should not have dared to say it.  She looked
me straight in the face for a few seconds before speaking.  Then, with an
air of girlish innocence which disarmed suspicion and convinced me at
once of her simple faith, she said in a voice that at once thrilled me
and evoked all my pity:

"Let me rest for a while, and cover me up with rugs.  That may give me
warmth.  I am dying of cold.  And I have a deadly fear upon me--a deadly
fear.  Sit by me, and let me hold your hand.  You are big and strong, and
you look brave.  It will reassure me.  I am not myself a coward, but
to-night fear has got me by the throat.  I can hardly breathe.  Do let me
stay till I am warm.  If you only knew what I have gone through, and have
to go through still, I am sure you would pity me and help me."

To say that I was astonished would be a mild description of my feelings.
I was not shocked.  The life which I have led was not one which makes for
prudery.  To travel in strange places amongst strange peoples with
strange views of their own is to have odd experiences and peculiar
adventures now and again; a man without human passions is not the type
necessary for an adventurous life, such as I myself have had.  But even a
man of passions and experiences can, when he respects a woman, be
shocked--even prudish--where his own opinion of her is concerned.  Such
must bring to her guarding any generosity which he has, and any
self-restraint also.  Even should she place herself in a doubtful
position, her honour calls to his honour.  This is a call which may not
be--_must_ not be--unanswered.  Even passion must pause for at least a
while at sound of such a trumpet-call.

This woman I did respect--much respect.  Her youth and beauty; her
manifest ignorance of evil; her superb disdain of convention, which could
only come through hereditary dignity; her terrible fear and
suffering--for there must be more in her unhappy condition than meets the
eye--would all demand respect, even if one did not hasten to yield it.
Nevertheless, I thought it necessary to enter a protest against her
embarrassing suggestion.  I certainly did feel a fool when making it,
also a cad.  I can truly say it was made only for her good, and out of
the best of me, such as I am.  I felt impossibly awkward; and stuttered
and stumbled before I spoke:

"But surely--the convenances!  Your being here alone at night!  Mrs.
Grundy--convention--the--"

She interrupted me with an incomparable dignity--a dignity which had the
effect of shutting me up like a clasp-knife and making me feel a decided
inferior--and a poor show at that.  There was such a gracious simplicity
and honesty in it, too, such self-respecting knowledge of herself and her
position, that I could be neither angry nor hurt.  I could only feel
ashamed of myself, and of my own littleness of mind and morals.  She
seemed in her icy coldness--now spiritual as well as bodily--like an
incarnate figure of Pride as she answered:

"What are convenances or conventions to me!  If you only knew where I
have come from--the existence (if it can be called so) which I have
had--the loneliness--the horror!  And besides, it is for me to _make_
conventions, not to yield my personal freedom of action to them.  Even as
I am--even here and in this garb--I am above convention.  Convenances do
not trouble me or hamper me.  That, at least, I have won by what I have
gone through, even if it had never come to me through any other way.  Let
me stay."  She said the last words, in spite of all her pride,
appealingly.  But still, there was a note of high pride in all this--in
all she said and did, in her attitude and movement, in the tones of her
voice, in the loftiness of her carriage and the steadfast look of her
open, starlit eyes.  Altogether, there was something so rarely lofty in
herself and all that clad her that, face to face with it and with her, my
feeble attempt at moral precaution seemed puny, ridiculous, and out of
place.  Without a word in the doing, I took from an old chiffonier chest
an armful of blankets, several of which I threw over her as she lay, for
in the meantime, having replaced the coverlet, she had lain down at
length on the bed.  I took a chair, and sat down beside her.  When she
stretched out her hand from beneath the pile of wraps, I took it in mine,
saying:

"Get warm and rest.  Sleep if you can.  You need not fear; I shall guard
you with my life."

She looked at me gratefully, her starry eyes taking a new light more full
of illumination than was afforded by the wax candle, which was shaded
from her by my body . . . She was horribly cold, and her teeth chattered
so violently that I feared lest she should have incurred some dangerous
evil from her wetting and the cold that followed it.  I felt, however, so
awkward that I could find no words to express my fears; moreover, I
hardly dared say anything at all regarding herself after the haughty way
in which she had received my well-meant protest.  Manifestly I was but to
her as a sort of refuge and provider of heat, altogether impersonal, and
not to be regarded in any degree as an individual.  In these humiliating
circumstances what could I do but sit quiet--and wait developments?

Little by little the fierce chattering of her teeth began to abate as the
warmth of her surroundings stole through her.  I also felt, even in this
strangely awakening position, the influence of the quiet; and sleep began
to steal over me.  Several times I tried to fend it off, but, as I could
not make any overt movement without alarming my strange and beautiful
companion, I had to yield myself to drowsiness.  I was still in such an
overwhelming stupor of surprise that I could not even think freely.
There was nothing for me but to control myself and wait.  Before I could
well fix my thoughts I was asleep.

I was recalled to consciousness by hearing, even through the pall of
sleep that bound me, the crowing of a cock in some of the out-offices of
the castle.  At the same instant the figure, lying deathly still but for
the gentle heaving of her bosom, began to struggle wildly.  The sound had
won through the gates of her sleep also.  With a swift, gliding motion
she slipped from the bed to the floor, saying in a fierce whisper as she
pulled herself up to her full height:

"Let me out!  I must go!  I must go!"

By this time I was fully awake, and the whole position of things came to
me in an instant which I shall never--can never--forget: the dim light of
the candle, now nearly burned down to the socket, all the dimmer from the
fact that the first grey gleam of morning was stealing in round the edges
of the heavy curtain; the tall, slim figure in the brown dressing-gown
whose over-length trailed on the floor, the black hair showing glossy in
the light, and increasing by contrast the marble whiteness of the face,
in which the black eyes sent through their stars fiery gleams.  She
appeared quite in a frenzy of haste; her eagerness was simply
irresistible.

I was so stupefied with amazement, as well as with sleep, that I did not
attempt to stop her, but began instinctively to help her by furthering
her wishes.  As she ran behind the screen, and, as far as sound could
inform me,--began frantically to disrobe herself of the warm
dressing-gown and to don again the ice-cold wet shroud, I pulled back the
curtain from the window, and drew the bolt of the glass door.  As I did
so she was already behind me, shivering.  As I threw open the door she
glided out with a swift silent movement, but trembling in an agonized
way.  As she passed me, she murmured in a low voice, which was almost
lost in the chattering of her teeth:

"Oh, thank you--thank you a thousand times!  But I must go.  I _must_!  I
_must_!  I shall come again, and try to show my gratitude.  Do not
condemn me as ungrateful--till then."  And she was gone.

I watched her pass the length of the white path, flitting from shrub to
shrub or statue as she had come.  In the cold grey light of the
undeveloped dawn she seemed even more ghostly than she had done in the
black shadow of the night.

When she disappeared from sight in the shadow of the wood, I stood on the
terrace for a long time watching, in case I should be afforded another
glimpse of her, for there was now no doubt in my mind that she had for me
some strange attraction.  I felt even then that the look in those
glorious starry eyes would be with me always so long as I might live.
There was some fascination which went deeper than my eyes or my flesh or
my heart--down deep into the very depths of my soul.  My mind was all in
a whirl, so that I could hardly think coherently.  It all was like a
dream; the reality seemed far away.  It was not possible to doubt that
the phantom figure which had been so close to me during the dark hours of
the night was actual flesh and blood.  Yet she was so cold, so cold!
Altogether I could not fix my mind to either proposition: that it was a
living woman who had held my hand, or a dead body reanimated for the time
or the occasion in some strange manner.

The difficulty was too great for me to make up my mind upon it, even had
I wanted to.  But, in any case, I did not want to.  This would, no doubt,
come in time.  But till then I wished to dream on, as anyone does in a
dream which can still be blissful though there be pauses of pain, or
ghastliness, or doubt, or terror.

So I closed the window and drew the curtain again, feeling for the first
time the cold in which I had stood on the wet marble floor of the terrace
when my bare feet began to get warm on the soft carpet.  To get rid of
the chill feeling I got into the bed on which _she_ had lain, and as the
warmth restored me tried to think coherently.  For a short while I was
going over the facts of the night--or what seemed as facts to my
remembrance.  But as I continued to think, the possibilities of any
result seemed to get less, and I found myself vainly trying to reconcile
with the logic of life the grim episode of the night.  The effort proved
to be too much for such concentration as was left to me; moreover,
interrupted sleep was clamant, and would not be denied.  What I dreamt
of--if I dreamt at all--I know not.  I only know that I was ready for
waking when the time came.  It came with a violent knocking at my door.
I sprang from bed, fully awake in a second, drew the bolt, and slipped
back to bed.  With a hurried "May I come in?" Aunt Janet entered.  She
seemed relieved when she saw me, and gave without my asking an
explanation of her perturbation:

"Oh, laddie, I hae been so uneasy aboot ye all the nicht.  I hae had
dreams an' veesions an' a' sorts o' uncanny fancies.  I fear that--"  She
was by now drawing back the curtain, and as her eyes took in the marks of
wet all over the floor the current of her thoughts changed:

"Why, laddie, whativer hae ye been doin' wi' yer baith?  Oh, the mess ye
hae made!  'Tis sinful to gie sic trouble an' waste . . . "  And so she
went on.  I was glad to hear the tirade, which was only what a good
housewife, outraged in her sentiments of order, would have made.  I
listened in patience--with pleasure when I thought of what she would have
thought (and said) had she known the real facts.  I was well pleased to
have got off so easily.



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                         _April_ 10, 1907.

For some days after what I call "the episode" I was in a strange
condition of mind.  I did not take anyone--not even Aunt Janet--into
confidence.  Even she dear, and open-hearted and liberal-minded as she
is, might not have understood well enough to be just and tolerant; and I
did not care to hear any adverse comment on my strange visitor.  Somehow
I could not bear the thought of anyone finding fault with her or in her,
though, strangely enough, I was eternally defending her to myself; for,
despite my wishes, embarrassing thoughts _would_ come again and again,
and again in all sorts and variants of queries difficult to answer.  I
found myself defending her, sometimes as a woman hard pressed by
spiritual fear and physical suffering, sometimes as not being amenable to
laws that govern the Living.  Indeed, I could not make up my mind whether
I looked on her as a living human being or as one with some strange
existence in another world, and having only a chance foothold in our own.
In such doubt imagination began to work, and thoughts of evil, of danger,
of doubt, even of fear, began to crowd on me with such persistence and in
such varied forms that I found my instinct of reticence growing into a
settled purpose.  The value of this instinctive precaution was promptly
shown by Aunt Janet's state of mind, with consequent revelation of it.
She became full of gloomy prognostications and what I thought were morbid
fears.  For the first time in my life I discovered that Aunt Janet had
nerves!  I had long had a secret belief that she was gifted, to some
degree at any rate, with Second Sight, which quality, or whatever it is,
skilled in the powers if not the lore of superstition, manages to keep at
stretch not only the mind of its immediate pathic, but of others relevant
to it.  Perhaps this natural quality had received a fresh impetus from
the arrival of some cases of her books sent on by Sir Colin.  She
appeared to read and reread these works, which were chiefly on occult
subjects, day and night, except when she was imparting to me choice
excerpts of the most baleful and fearsome kind.  Indeed, before a week
was over I found myself to be an expert in the history of the cult, as
well as in its manifestations, which latter I had been versed in for a
good many years.

The result of all this was that it set me brooding.  Such, at least, I
gathered was the fact when Aunt Janet took me to task for it.  She always
speaks out according to her convictions, so that her thinking I brooded
was to me a proof that I did; and after a personal examination I
came--reluctantly--to the conclusion that she was right, so far, at any
rate, as my outer conduct was concerned.  The state of mind I was in,
however, kept me from making any acknowledgment of it--the real cause of
my keeping so much to myself and of being so _distrait_.  And so I went
on, torturing myself as before with introspective questioning; and she,
with her mind set on my actions, and endeavouring to find a cause for
them, continued and expounded her beliefs and fears.

Her nightly chats with me when we were alone after dinner--for I had come
to avoid her questioning at other times--kept my imagination at high
pressure.  Despite myself, I could not but find new cause for concern in
the perennial founts of her superstition.  I had thought, years ago, that
I had then sounded the depths of this branch of psychicism; but this new
phase of thought, founded on the really deep hold which the existence of
my beautiful visitor and her sad and dreadful circumstances had taken
upon me, brought me a new concern in the matter of self-importance.  I
came to think that I must reconstruct my self-values, and begin a fresh
understanding of ethical beliefs.  Do what I would, my mind would keep
turning on the uncanny subjects brought before it.  I began to apply them
one by one to my own late experience, and unconsciously to try to fit
them in turn to the present case.

The effect of this brooding was that I was, despite my own will, struck
by the similarity of circumstances bearing on my visitor, and the
conditions apportioned by tradition and superstition to such strange
survivals from earlier ages as these partial existences which are rather
Undead than Living--still walking the earth, though claimed by the world
of the Dead.  Amongst them are the Vampire, or the Wehr-Wolf.  To this
class also might belong in a measure the Doppelganger--one of whose dual
existences commonly belongs to the actual world around it.  So, too, the
denizens of the world of Astralism.  In any of these named worlds there
is a material presence--which must be created, if only for a single or
periodic purpose.  It matters not whether a material presence already
created can be receptive of a disembodied soul, or a soul unattached can
have a body built up for it or around it; or, again, whether the body of
a dead person can be made seeming quick through some diabolic influence
manifested in the present, or an inheritance or result of some baleful
use of malefic power in the past.  The result is the same in each case,
though the ways be widely different: a soul and a body which are not in
unity but brought together for strange purposes through stranger means
and by powers still more strange.

Through much thought and a process of exclusions the eerie form which
seemed to be most in correspondence with my adventure, and most suitable
to my fascinating visitor, appeared to be the Vampire.  Doppelganger,
Astral creations, and all such-like, did not comply with the conditions
of my night experience.  The Wehr-Wolf is but a variant of the Vampire,
and so needed not to be classed or examined at all.  Then it was that,
thus focussed, the Lady of the Shroud (for so I came to hold her in my
mind) began to assume a new force.  Aunt Janet's library afforded me
clues which I followed with avidity.  In my secret heart I hated the
quest, and did not wish to go on with it.  But in this I was not my own
master.  Do what I would--brush away doubts never so often, new doubts
and imaginings came in their stead.  The circumstance almost repeated the
parable of the Seven Devils who took the place of the exorcised one.
Doubts I could stand.  Imaginings I could stand.  But doubts and
imaginings together made a force so fell that I was driven to accept any
reading of the mystery which might presumably afford a foothold for
satisfying thought.  And so I came to accept tentatively the Vampire
theory--accept it, at least, so far as to examine it as judicially as was
given me to do.  As the days wore on, so the conviction grew.  The more I
read on the subject, the more directly the evidences pointed towards this
view.  The more I thought, the more obstinate became the conviction.  I
ransacked Aunt Janet's volumes again and again to find anything to the
contrary; but in vain.  Again, no matter how obstinate were my
convictions at any given time, unsettlement came with fresh thinking over
the argument, so that I was kept in a harassing state of uncertainty.

Briefly, the evidence in favour of accord between the facts of the case
and the Vampire theory were:

Her coming was at night--the time the Vampire is according to the theory,
free to move at will.

She wore her shroud--a necessity of coming fresh from grave or tomb; for
there is nothing occult about clothing which is not subject to astral or
other influences.

She had to be helped into my room--in strict accordance with what one
sceptical critic of occultism has called "the Vampire etiquette."

She made violent haste in getting away at cock-crow.

She seemed preternaturally cold; her sleep was almost abnormal in
intensity, and yet the sound of the cock-crowing came through it.

These things showed her to be subject to _some_ laws, though not in exact
accord within those which govern human beings.  Under the stress of such
circumstances as she must have gone through, her vitality seemed more
than human--the quality of vitality which could outlive ordinary burial.
Again, such purpose as she had shown in donning, under stress of some
compelling direction, her ice-cold wet shroud, and, wrapt in it, going
out again into the night, was hardly normal for a woman.

But if so, and if she was indeed a Vampire, might not whatever it may be
that holds such beings in thrall be by some means or other exorcised?  To
find the means must be my next task.  I am actually pining to see her
again.  Never before have I been stirred to my depths by anyone.  Come it
from Heaven or Hell, from the Earth or the Grave, it does not matter; I
shall make it my task to win her back to life and peace.  If she be
indeed a Vampire, the task may be hard and long; if she be not so, and if
it be merely that circumstances have so gathered round her as to produce
that impression, the task may be simpler and the result more sweet.  No,
not more sweet; for what can be more sweet than to restore the lost or
seemingly lost soul of the woman you love!  There, the truth is out at
last!  I suppose that I have fallen in love with her.  If so, it is too
late for me to fight against it.  I can only wait with what patience I
can till I see her again.  But to that end I can do nothing.  I know
absolutely nothing about her--not even her name.  Patience!



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                         _April_ 16, 1907.

The only relief I have had from the haunting anxiety regarding the Lady
of the Shroud has been in the troubled state of my adopted country.
There has evidently been something up which I have not been allowed to
know.  The mountaineers are troubled and restless; are wandering about,
singly and in parties, and holding meetings in strange places.  This is
what I gather used to be in old days when intrigues were on foot with
Turks, Greeks, Austrians, Italians, Russians.  This concerns me vitally,
for my mind has long been made up to share the fortunes of the Land of
the Blue Mountains.  For good or ill I mean to stay here: _J'y suis_,
_j'y reste_.  I share henceforth the lot of the Blue Mountaineers; and
not Turkey, nor Greece, nor Austria, nor Italy, nor Russia--no, not
France nor Germany either; not man nor God nor Devil shall drive me from
my purpose.  With these patriots I throw in my lot!  My only difficulty
seemed at first to be with the men themselves.  They are so proud that at
the beginning I feared they would not even accord me the honour of being
one of them!  However, things always move on somehow, no matter what
difficulties there be at the beginning.  Never mind!  When one looks back
at an accomplished fact the beginning is not to be seen--and if it were
it would not matter.  It is not of any account, anyhow.

I heard that there was going to be a great meeting near here yesterday
afternoon, and I attended it.  I think it was a success.  If such is any
proof, I felt elated as well as satisfied when I came away.  Aunt Janet's
Second Sight on the subject was comforting, though grim, and in a measure
disconcerting.  When I was saying good-night she asked me to bend down my
head.  As I did so, she laid her hands on it and passed them all over it.
I heard her say to herself:

"Strange!  There's nothing there; yet I could have sworn I saw it!"  I
asked her to explain, but she would not.  For once she was a little
obstinate, and refused point blank to even talk of the subject.  She was
not worried nor unhappy; so I had no cause for concern.  I said nothing,
but I shall wait and see.  Most mysteries become plain or disappear
altogether in time.  But about the meeting--lest I forget!

When I joined the mountaineers who had assembled, I really think they
were glad to see me; though some of them seemed adverse, and others did
not seem over well satisfied.  However, absolute unity is very seldom to
be found.  Indeed, it is almost impossible; and in a free community is
not altogether to be desired.  When it is apparent, the gathering lacks
that sense of individual feeling which makes for the real consensus of
opinion--which is the real unity of purpose.  The meeting was at first,
therefore, a little cold and distant.  But presently it began to thaw,
and after some fiery harangues I was asked to speak.  Happily, I had
begun to learn the Balkan language as soon as ever Uncle Roger's wishes
had been made known to me, and as I have some facility of tongues and a
great deal of experience, I soon began to know something of it.  Indeed,
when I had been here a few weeks, with opportunity of speaking daily with
the people themselves, and learned to understand the intonations and
vocal inflexions, I felt quite easy in speaking it.  I understood every
word which had up to then been spoken at the meeting, and when I spoke
myself I felt that they understood.  That is an experience which every
speaker has in a certain way and up to a certain point.  He knows by some
kind of instinct if his hearers are with him; if they respond, they must
certainly have understood.  Last night this was marked.  I felt it every
instant I was talking and when I came to realize that the men were in
strict accord with my general views, I took them into confidence with
regard to my own personal purpose.  It was the beginning of a mutual
trust; so for peroration I told them that I had come to the conclusion
that what they wanted most for their own protection and the security and
consolidation of their nation was arms--arms of the very latest pattern.
Here they interrupted me with wild cheers, which so strung me up that I
went farther than I intended, and made a daring venture.  "Ay," I
repeated, "the security and consolidation of your country--of _our_
country, for I have come to live amongst you.  Here is my home whilst I
live.  I am with you heart and soul.  I shall live with you, fight
shoulder to shoulder with you, and, if need be, shall die with you!"
Here the shouting was terrific, and the younger men raised their guns to
fire a salute in Blue Mountain fashion.  But on the instant the Vladika
{1} held up his hands and motioned them to desist.  In the immediate
silence he spoke, sharply at first, but later ascending to a high pitch
of single-minded, lofty eloquence.  His words rang in my ears long after
the meeting was over and other thoughts had come between them and the
present.

"Silence!" he thundered.  "Make no echoes in the forest or through the
hills at this dire time of stress and threatened danger to our land.
Bethink ye of this meeting, held here and in secret, in order that no
whisper of it may be heard afar.  Have ye all, brave men of the Blue
Mountains, come hither through the forest like shadows that some of you,
thoughtless, may enlighten your enemies as to our secret purpose?  The
thunder of your guns would doubtless sound well in the ears of those who
wish us ill and try to work us wrong.  Fellow-countrymen, know ye not
that the Turk is awake once more for our harming?  The Bureau of Spies
has risen from the torpor which came on it when the purpose against our
Teuta roused our mountains to such anger that the frontiers blazed with
passion, and were swept with fire and sword.  Moreover, there is a
traitor somewhere in the land, or else incautious carelessness has served
the same base purpose.  Something of our needs--our doing, whose secret
we have tried to hide, has gone out.  The myrmidons of the Turk are close
on our borders, and it may be that some of them have passed our guards
and are amidst us unknown.  So it behoves us doubly to be discreet.
Believe me that I share with you, my brothers, our love for the gallant
Englishman who has come amongst us to share our sorrows and
ambitions--and I trust it may be our joys.  We are all united in the wish
to do him honour--though not in the way by which danger might be carried
on the wings of love.  My brothers, our newest brother comes to us from
the Great Nation which amongst the nations has been our only friend, and
which has ere now helped us in our direst need--that mighty Britain whose
hand has ever been raised in the cause of freedom.  We of the Blue
Mountains know her best as she stands with sword in hand face to face
with our foes.  And this, her son and now our brother, brings further to
our need the hand of a giant and the heart of a lion.  Later on, when
danger does not ring us round, when silence is no longer our outer guard;
we shall bid him welcome in true fashion of our land.  But till then he
will believe--for he is great-hearted--that our love and thanks and
welcome are not to be measured by sound.  When the time comes, then shall
be sound in his honour--not of rifles alone, but bells and cannon and the
mighty voice of a free people shouting as one.  But now we must be wise
and silent, for the Turk is once again at our gates.  Alas! the cause of
his former coming may not be, for she whose beauty and nobility and whose
place in our nation and in our hearts tempted him to fraud and violence
is not with us to share even our anxiety."

Here his voice broke, and there arose from all a deep wailing sound,
which rose and rose till the woods around us seemed broken by a mighty
and long-sustained sob.  The orator saw that his purpose was
accomplished, and with a short sentence finished his harangue: "But the
need of our nation still remains!"  Then, with an eloquent gesture to me
to proceed, he merged in the crowd and disappeared.

How could I even attempt to follow such a speaker with any hope of
success?  I simply told them what I had already done in the way of help,
saying:

"As you needed arms, I have got them.  My agent sends me word through the
code between us that he has procured for me--for us--fifty thousand of
the newest-pattern rifles, the French Ingis-Malbron, which has surpassed
all others, and sufficient ammunition to last for a year of war.  The
first section is in hand, and will soon be ready for consignment.  There
are other war materials, too, which, when they arrive, will enable every
man and woman--even the children--of our land to take a part in its
defence should such be needed.  My brothers, I am with you in all things,
for good or ill!"

It made me very proud to hear the mighty shout which arose.  I had felt
exalted before, but now this personal development almost unmanned me.  I
was glad of the long-sustained applause to recover my self-control.

I was quite satisfied that the meeting did not want to hear any other
speaker, for they began to melt away without any formal notification
having been given.  I doubt if there will be another meeting soon again.
The weather has begun to break, and we are in for another spell of rain.
It is disagreeable, of course; but it has its own charm.  It was during a
spell of wet weather that the Lady of the Shroud came to me.  Perhaps the
rain may bring her again.  I hope so, with all my soul.



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                         _April_ 23, 1907.

The rain has continued for four whole days and nights, and the low-lying
ground is like a quagmire in places.  In the sunlight the whole mountains
glisten with running streams and falling water.  I feel a strange kind of
elation, but from no visible cause.  Aunt Janet rather queered it by
telling me, as she said good-night, to be very careful of myself, as she
had seen in a dream last night a figure in a shroud.  I fear she was not
pleased that I did not take it with all the seriousness that she did.  I
would not wound her for the world if I could help it, but the idea of a
shroud gets too near the bone to be safe, and I had to fend her off at
all hazards.  So when I doubted if the Fates regarded the visionary
shroud as of necessity appertaining to me, she said, in a way that was,
for her, almost sharp:

"Take care, laddie.  'Tis ill jesting wi' the powers o' time Unknown."

Perhaps it was that her talk put the subject in my mind.  The woman
needed no such aid; she was always there; but when I locked myself into
my room that night, I half expected to find her in the room.  I was not
sleepy, so I took a book of Aunt Janet's and began to read.  The title
was "On the Powers and Qualities of Disembodied Spirits."  "Your
grammar," said I to the author, "is hardly attractive, but I may learn
something which might apply to her.  I shall read your book."  Before
settling down to it, however, I thought I would have a look at the
garden.  Since the night of the visit the garden seemed to have a new
attractiveness for me: a night seldom passed without my having a last
look at it before turning in.  So I drew the great curtain and looked
out.

The scene was beautiful, but almost entirely desolate.  All was ghastly
in the raw, hard gleams of moonlight coming fitfully through the masses
of flying cloud.  The wind was rising, and the air was damp and cold.  I
looked round the room instinctively, and noticed that the fire was laid
ready for lighting, and that there were small-cut logs of wood piled
beside the hearth.  Ever since that night I have had a fire laid ready.
I was tempted to light it, but as I never have a fire unless I sleep in
the open, I hesitated to begin.  I went back to the window, and, opening
the catch, stepped out on the terrace.  As I looked down the white walk
and let my eyes range over the expanse of the garden, where everything
glistened as the moonlight caught the wet, I half expected to see some
white figure flitting amongst the shrubs and statues.  The whole scene of
the former visit came back to me so vividly that I could hardly believe
that any time had passed since then.  It was the same scene, and again
late in the evening.  Life in Vissarion was primitive, and early hours
prevailed--though not so late as on that night.

As I looked I thought I caught a glimpse of something white far away.  It
was only a ray of moonlight coming through the rugged edge of a cloud.
But all the same it set me in a strange state of perturbation.  Somehow I
seemed to lose sight of my own identity.  It was as though I was
hypnotized by the situation or by memory, or perhaps by some occult
force.  Without thinking of what I was doing, or being conscious of any
reason for it, I crossed the room and set light to the fire.  Then I blew
out the candle and came to the window again.  I never thought it might be
a foolish thing to do--to stand at a window with a light behind me in
this country, where every man carries a gun with him always.  I was in my
evening clothes, too, with my breast well marked by a white shirt.  I
opened the window and stepped out on the terrace.  There I stood for many
minutes, thinking.  All the time my eyes kept ranging over the garden.
Once I thought I saw a white figure moving, but it was not followed up,
so, becoming conscious that it was again beginning to rain, I stepped
back into the room, shut the window, and drew the curtain.  Then I
realized the comforting appearance of the fire, and went over and stood
before it.

Hark!  Once more there was a gentle tapping at the window.  I rushed over
to it and drew the curtain.

There, out on the rain-beaten terrace, stood the white shrouded figure,
more desolate-appearing than ever.  Ghastly pale she looked, as before,
but her eyes had an eager look which was new.  I took it that she was
attracted by the fire, which was by now well ablaze, and was throwing up
jets of flame as the dry logs crackled.  The leaping flames threw fitful
light across the room, and every gleam threw the white-clad figure into
prominence, showing the gleam of the black eyes, and fixing the stars
that lay in them.

Without a word I threw open the window, and, taking the white hand
extended to me, drew into the room the Lady of the Shroud.

As she entered and felt the warmth of the blazing fire, a glad look
spread over her face.  She made a movement as if to run to it.  But she
drew back an instant after, looking round with instinctive caution.  She
closed the window and bolted it, touched the lever which spread the
grille across the opening, and pulled close the curtain behind it.  Then
she went swiftly to the door and tried if it was locked.  Satisfied as to
this, she came quickly over to the fire, and, kneeling before it,
stretched out her numbed hands to the blaze.  Almost on the instant her
wet shroud began to steam.  I stood wondering.  The precautions of
secrecy in the midst of her suffering--for that she did suffer was only
too painfully manifest--must have presupposed some danger.  Then and
there my mind was made up that there should no harm assail her that I by
any means could fend off.  Still, the present must be attended to;
pneumonia and other ills stalked behind such a chill as must infallibly
come on her unless precautions were taken.  I took again the
dressing-gown which she had worn before and handed it to her, motioning
as I did so towards the screen which had made a dressing-room for her on
the former occasion.  To my surprise she hesitated.  I waited.  She
waited, too, and then laid down the dressing-gown on the edge of the
stone fender.  So I spoke:

"Won't you change as you did before?  Your--your frock can then be dried.
Do!  It will be so much safer for you to be dry clad when you resume your
own dress."

"How can I whilst you are here?"

Her words made me stare, so different were they from her acts of the
other visit.  I simply bowed--speech on such a subject would be at least
inadequate--and walked over to the window.  Passing behind the curtain, I
opened the window.  Before stepping out on to the terrace, I looked into
the room and said:

"Take your own time.  There is no hurry.  I dare say you will find there
all you may want.  I shall remain on the terrace until you summon me."
With that I went out on the terrace, drawing close the glass door behind
me.

I stood looking out on the dreary scene for what seemed a very short
time, my mind in a whirl.  There came a rustle from within, and I saw a
dark brown figure steal round the edge of the curtain.  A white hand was
raised, and beckoned me to come in.  I entered, bolting the window behind
me.  She had passed across the room, and was again kneeling before the
fire with her hands outstretched.  The shroud was laid in partially
opened folds on one side of the hearth, and was steaming heavily.  I
brought over some cushions and pillows, and made a little pile of them
beside her.

"Sit there," I said, "and rest quietly in the heat."  It may have been
the effect of the glowing heat, but there was a rich colour in her face
as she looked at me with shining eyes.  Without a word, but with a
courteous little bow, she sat down at once.  I put a thick rug across her
shoulders, and sat down myself on a stool a couple of feet away.

For fully five or six minutes we sat in silence.  At last, turning her
head towards me she said in a sweet, low voice:

"I had intended coming earlier on purpose to thank you for your very
sweet and gracious courtesy to me, but circumstances were such that I
could not leave my--my"--she hesitated before saying--"my abode.  I am
not free, as you and others are, to do what I will.  My existence is
sadly cold and stern, and full of horrors that appal.  But I _do_ thank
you.  For myself I am not sorry for the delay, for every hour shows me
more clearly how good and understanding and sympathetic you have been to
me.  I only hope that some day you may realize how kind you have been,
and how much I appreciate it."

"I am only too glad to be of any service," I said, feebly I felt, as I
held out my hand.  She did not seem to see it.  Her eyes were now on the
fire, and a warm blush dyed forehead and cheek and neck.  The reproof was
so gentle that no one could have been offended.  It was evident that she
was something coy and reticent, and would not allow me to come at present
more close to her, even to the touching of her hand.  But that her heart
was not in the denial was also evident in the glance from her glorious
dark starry eyes.  These glances--veritable lightning flashes coming
through her pronounced reserve--finished entirely any wavering there
might be in my own purpose.  I was aware now to the full that my heart
was quite subjugated.  I knew that I was in love--veritably so much in
love as to feel that without this woman, be she what she might, by my
side my future must be absolutely barren.

It was presently apparent that she did not mean to stay as long on this
occasion as on the last.  When the castle clock struck midnight she
suddenly sprang to her feet with a bound, saying:

"I must go!  There is midnight!"  I rose at once, the intensity of her
speech having instantly obliterated the sleep which, under the influence
of rest and warmth, was creeping upon me.  Once more she was in a frenzy
of haste, so I hurried towards the window, but as I looked back saw her,
despite her haste, still standing.  I motioned towards the screen, and
slipping behind the curtain, opened the window and went out on the
terrace.  As I was disappearing behind the curtain I saw her with the
tail of my eye lifting the shroud, now dry, from the hearth.

She was out through the window in an incredibly short time, now clothed
once more in that dreadful wrapping.  As she sped past me barefooted on
the wet, chilly marble which made her shudder, she whispered:

"Thank you again.  You _are_ good to me.  You can understand."

Once again I stood on the terrace, saw her melt like a shadow down the
steps, and disappear behind the nearest shrub.  Thence she flitted away
from point to point with exceeding haste.  The moonlight had now
disappeared behind heavy banks of cloud, so there was little light to see
by.  I could just distinguish a pale gleam here and there as she wended
her secret way.

For a long time I stood there alone thinking, as I watched the course she
had taken, and wondering where might be her ultimate destination.  As she
had spoken of her "abode," I knew there was some definitive objective of
her flight.

It was no use wondering.  I was so entirely ignorant of her surroundings
that I had not even a starting-place for speculation.  So I went in,
leaving the window open.  It seemed that this being so made one barrier
the less between us.  I gathered the cushions and rugs from before the
fire, which was no longer leaping, but burning with a steady glow, and
put them back in their places.  Aunt Janet might come in the morning, as
she had done before, and I did not wish to set her thinking.  She is much
too clever a person to have treading on the heels of a
mystery--especially one in which my own affections are engaged.  I wonder
what she would have said had she seen me kiss the cushion on which my
beautiful guest's head had rested?

When I was in bed, and in the dark save for the fading glow of the fire,
my thoughts became fixed that whether she came from Earth or Heaven or
Hell, my lovely visitor was already more to me than aught else in the
world.  This time she had, on going, said no word of returning.  I had
been so much taken up with her presence, and so upset by her abrupt
departure, that I had omitted to ask her.  And so I am driven, as before,
to accept the chance of her returning--a chance which I fear I am or may
be unable to control.

Surely enough Aunt Janet did come in the morning, early.  I was still
asleep when she knocked at my door.  With that purely physical
subconsciousness which comes with habit I must have realized the cause of
the sound, for I woke fully conscious of the fact that Aunt Janet had
knocked and was waiting to come in.  I jumped from bed, and back again
when I had unlocked the door.  When Aunt Janet came in she noticed the
cold of the room.

"Save us, laddie, but ye'll get your death o' cold in this room."  Then,
as she looked round and noticed the ashes of the extinct fire in the
grate:

"Eh, but ye're no that daft after a'; ye've had the sense to light yer
fire.  Glad I am that we had the fire laid and a wheen o' dry logs ready
to yer hand."  She evidently felt the cold air coming from the window,
for she went over and drew the curtain.  When she saw the open window,
she raised her hands in a sort of dismay, which to me, knowing how little
base for concern could be within her knowledge, was comic.  Hurriedly she
shut the window, and then, coming close over to my bed, said:

"Yon has been a fearsome nicht again, laddie, for yer poor auld aunty."

"Dreaming again, Aunt Janet?" I asked--rather flippantly as it seemed to
me.  She shook her head:

"Not so, Rupert, unless it be that the Lord gies us in dreams what we in
our spiritual darkness think are veesions."  I roused up at this.  When
Aunt Janet calls me Rupert, as she always used to do in my dear mother's
time, things are serious with her.  As I was back in childhood now,
recalled by her word, I thought the best thing I could do to cheer her
would be to bring her back there too--if I could.  So I patted the edge
of the bed as I used to do when I was a wee kiddie and wanted her to
comfort me, and said:

"Sit down, Aunt Janet, and tell me."  She yielded at once, and the look
of the happy old days grew over her face as though there had come a gleam
of sunshine.  She sat down, and I put out my hands as I used to do, and
took her hand between them.  There was a tear in her eye as she raised my
hand and kissed it as in old times.  But for the infinite pathos of it,
it would have been comic:

Aunt Janet, old and grey-haired, but still retaining her girlish slimness
of figure, petite, dainty as a Dresden figure, her face lined with the
care of years, but softened and ennobled by the unselfishness of those
years, holding up my big hand, which would outweigh her whole arm;
sitting dainty as a pretty old fairy beside a recumbent giant--for my
bulk never seems so great as when I am near this real little good fairy
of my life--seven feet beside four feet seven.

So she began as of old, as though she were about to soothe a frightened
child with a fairy tale:

"'Twas a veesion, I think, though a dream it may hae been.  But whichever
or whatever it was, it concerned my little boy, who has grown to be a big
giant, so much that I woke all of a tremble.  Laddie dear, I thought that
I saw ye being married."  This gave me an opening, though a small one,
for comforting her, so I took it at once:

"Why, dear, there isn't anything to alarm you in that, is there?  It was
only the other day when you spoke to me about the need of my getting
married, if it was only that you might have children of your boy playing
around your knees as their father used to do when he was a helpless wee
child himself."

"That is so, laddie," she answered gravely.  "But your weddin' was none
so merry as I fain would see.  True, you seemed to lo'e her wi' all yer
hairt.  Yer eyes shone that bright that ye might ha' set her afire, for
all her black locks and her winsome face.  But, laddie, that was not
all--no, not though her black een, that had the licht o' all the stars o'
nicht in them, shone in yours as though a hairt o' love an' passion, too,
dwelt in them.  I saw ye join hands, an' heard a strange voice that
talked stranger still, but I saw none ither.  Your eyes an' her eyes, an'
your hand an' hers, were all I saw.  For all else was dim, and the
darkness was close around ye twa.  And when the benison was spoken--I
knew that by the voices that sang, and by the gladness of her een, as
well as by the pride and glory of yours--the licht began to glow a wee
more, an' I could see yer bride.  She was in a veil o' wondrous fine
lace.  And there were orange-flowers in her hair, though there were
twigs, too, and there was a crown o' flowers on head wi' a golden band
round it.  And the heathen candles that stood on the table wi' the Book
had some strange effect, for the reflex o' it hung in the air o'er her
head like the shadow of a crown.  There was a gold ring on her finger and
a silver one on yours."  Here she paused and trembled, so that, hoping to
dispel her fears, I said, as like as I could to the way I used to when I
was a child:

"Go on, Aunt Janet."

She did not seem to recognize consciously the likeness between past and
present; but the effect was there, for she went on more like her old
self, though there was a prophetic gravity in her voice, more marked than
I had ever heard from her:

"All this I've told ye was well; but, oh, laddie, there was a dreadful
lack o' livin' joy such as I should expect from the woman whom my boy had
chosen for his wife--and at the marriage coupling, too!  And no wonder,
when all is said; for though the marriage veil o' love was fine, an' the
garland o' flowers was fresh-gathered, underneath them a' was nane ither
than a ghastly shroud.  As I looked in my veesion--or maybe dream--I
expectit to see the worms crawl round the flagstane at her feet.  If
'twas not Death, laddie dear, that stood by ye, it was the shadow o'
Death that made the darkness round ye, that neither the light o' candles
nor the smoke o' heathen incense could pierce.  Oh, laddie, laddie, wae
is me that I hae seen sic a veesion--waking or sleeping, it matters not!
I was sair distressed--so sair that I woke wi' a shriek on my lips and
bathed in cold sweat.  I would hae come doon to ye to see if you were
hearty or no--or even to listen at your door for any sound o' yer being
quick, but that I feared to alarm ye till morn should come.  I've counted
the hours and the minutes since midnight, when I saw the veesion, till I
came hither just the now."

"Quite right, Aunt Janet," I said, "and I thank you for your kind thought
for me in the matter, now and always."  Then I went on, for I wanted to
take precautions against the possibility of her discovery of my secret.
I could not bear to think that she might run my precious secret to earth
in any well-meant piece of bungling.  That would be to me disaster
unbearable.  She might frighten away altogether my beautiful visitor,
even whose name or origin I did not know, and I might never see her
again:

"You must never do that, Aunt Janet.  You and I are too good friends to
have sense of distrust or annoyance come between us--which would surely
happen if I had to keep thinking that you or anyone else might be
watching me."



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                         _April_ 27, 1907.

After a spell of loneliness which has seemed endless I have something to
write.  When the void in my heart was becoming the receptacle for many
devils of suspicion and distrust I set myself a task which might, I
thought, keep my thoughts in part, at any rate, occupied--to explore
minutely the neighbourhood round the Castle.  This might, I hoped, serve
as an anodyne to my pain of loneliness, which grew more acute as the
days, the hours, wore on, even if it should not ultimately afford me some
clue to the whereabouts of the woman whom I had now grown to love so
madly.

My exploration soon took a systematic form, as I intended that it should
be exhaustive.  I would take every day a separate line of advance from
the Castle, beginning at the south and working round by the east to the
north.  The first day only took me to the edge of the creek, which I
crossed in a boat, and landed at the base of the cliff opposite.  I found
the cliffs alone worth a visit.  Here and there were openings to caves
which I made up my mind to explore later.  I managed to climb up the
cliff at a spot less beetling than the rest, and continued my journey.
It was, though very beautiful, not a specially interesting place.  I
explored that spoke of the wheel of which Vissarion was the hub, and got
back just in time for dinner.

The next day I took a course slightly more to the eastward.  I had no
difficulty in keeping a straight path, for, once I had rowed across the
creek, the old church of St. Sava rose before me in stately gloom.  This
was the spot where many generations of the noblest of the Land of the
Blue Mountains had from time immemorial been laid to rest, amongst them
the Vissarions.  Again, I found the opposite cliffs pierced here and
there with caves, some with wide openings,--others the openings of which
were partly above and partly below water.  I could, however, find no
means of climbing the cliff at this part, and had to make a long detour,
following up the line of the creek till further on I found a piece of
beach from which ascent was possible.  Here I ascended, and found that I
was on a line between the Castle and the southern side of the mountains.
I saw the church of St. Sava away to my right, and not far from the edge
of the cliff.  I made my way to it at once, for as yet I had never been
near it.  Hitherto my excursions had been limited to the Castle and its
many gardens and surroundings.  It was of a style with which I was not
familiar--with four wings to the points of the compass.  The great
doorway, set in a magnificent frontage of carved stone of manifestly
ancient date, faced west, so that, when one entered, he went east.  To my
surprise--for somehow I expected the contrary--I found the door open.
Not wide open, but what is called ajar--manifestly not locked or barred,
but not sufficiently open for one to look in.  I entered, and after
passing through a wide vestibule, more like a section of a corridor than
an ostensible entrance, made my way through a spacious doorway into the
body of the church.  The church itself was almost circular, the openings
of the four naves being spacious enough to give the appearance of the
interior as a whole, being a huge cross.  It was strangely dim, for the
window openings were small and high-set, and were, moreover, filled with
green or blue glass, each window having a colour to itself.  The glass
was very old, being of the thirteenth or fourteenth century.  Such
appointments as there were--for it had a general air of desolation--were
of great beauty and richness,--especially so to be in a place--even a
church--where the door lay open, and no one was to be seen.  It was
strangely silent even for an old church on a lonesome headland.  There
reigned a dismal solemnity which seemed to chill me, accustomed as I have
been to strange and weird places.  It seemed abandoned, though it had not
that air of having been neglected which is so often to be noticed in old
churches.  There was none of the everlasting accumulation of dust which
prevails in places of higher cultivation and larger and more strenuous
work.

In the church itself or its appending chambers I could find no clue or
suggestion which could guide me in any way in my search for the Lady of
the Shroud.  Monuments there were in profusion--statues, tablets, and all
the customary memorials of the dead.  The families and dates represented
were simply bewildering.  Often the name of Vissarion was given, and the
inscription which it held I read through carefully, looking to find some
enlightenment of any kind.  But all in vain: there was nothing to see in
the church itself.  So I determined to visit the crypt.  I had no lantern
or candle with me, so had to go back to the Castle to secure one.

It was strange, coming in from the sunlight, here overwhelming to one so
recently accustomed to northern skies, to note the slender gleam of the
lantern which I carried, and which I had lit inside the door.  At my
first entry to the church my mind had been so much taken up with the
strangeness of the place, together with the intensity of wish for some
sort of clue, that I had really no opportunity of examining detail.  But
now detail became necessary, as I had to find the entrance to the crypt.
My puny light could not dissipate the semi-Cimmerian gloom of the vast
edifice; I had to throw the feeble gleam into one after another of the
dark corners.

At last I found, behind the great screen, a narrow stone staircase which
seemed to wind down into the rock.  It was not in any way secret, but
being in the narrow space behind the great screen, was not visible except
when close to it.  I knew I was now close to my objective, and began to
descend.  Accustomed though I have been to all sorts of mysteries and
dangers, I felt awed and almost overwhelmed by a sense of loneliness and
desolation as I descended the ancient winding steps.  These were many in
number, roughly hewn of old in the solid rock on which the church was
built.

I met a fresh surprise in finding that the door of the crypt was open.
After all, this was different from the church-door being open; for in
many places it is a custom to allow all comers at all times to find rest
and comfort in the sacred place.  But I did expect that at least the
final resting-place of the historic dead would be held safe against
casual intrusion.  Even I, on a quest which was very near my heart,
paused with an almost overwhelming sense of decorum before passing
through that open door.  The crypt was a huge place, strangely lofty for
a vault.  From its formation, however, I soon came to the conclusion that
it was originally a natural cavern altered to its present purpose by the
hand of man.  I could hear somewhere near the sound of running water, but
I could not locate it.  Now and again at irregular intervals there was a
prolonged booming, which could only come from a wave breaking in a
confined place.  The recollection then came to me of the proximity of the
church to the top of the beetling cliff, and of the half-sunk cavern
entrances which pierced it.

With the gleam of my lamp to guide me, I went through and round the whole
place.  There were many massive tombs, mostly rough-hewn from great slabs
or blocks of stone.  Some of them were marble, and the cutting of all was
ancient.  So large and heavy were some of them that it was a wonder to me
how they could ever have been brought to this place, to which the only
entrance was seemingly the narrow, tortuous stairway by which I had come.
At last I saw near one end of the crypt a great chain hanging.  Turning
the light upward, I found that it depended from a ring set over a wide
opening, evidently made artificially.  It must have been through this
opening that the great sarcophagi had been lowered.

Directly underneath the hanging chain, which did not come closer to the
ground than some eight or ten feet, was a huge tomb in the shape of a
rectangular coffer or sarcophagus.  It was open, save for a huge sheet of
thick glass which rested above it on two thick balks of dark oak, cut to
exceeding smoothness, which lay across it, one at either end.  On the far
side from where I stood each of these was joined to another oak plank,
also cut smooth, which sloped gently to the rocky floor.  Should it be
necessary to open the tomb, the glass could be made to slide along the
supports and descend by the sloping planks.

Naturally curious to know what might be within such a strange receptacle,
I raised the lantern, depressing its lens so that the light might fall
within.

Then I started back with a cry, the lantern slipping from my nerveless
hand and falling with a ringing sound on the great sheet of thick glass.

Within, pillowed on soft cushions, and covered with a mantle woven of
white natural fleece sprigged with tiny sprays of pine wrought in gold,
lay the body of a woman--none other than my beautiful visitor.  She was
marble white, and her long black eyelashes lay on her white cheeks as
though she slept.

Without a word or a sound, save the sounds made by my hurrying feet on
the stone flooring, I fled up the steep steps, and through the dim
expanse of the church, out into the bright sunlight.  I found that I had
mechanically raised the fallen lamp, and had taken it with me in my
flight.

My feet naturally turned towards home.  It was all instinctive.  The new
horror had--for the time, at any rate--drowned my mind in its mystery,
deeper than the deepest depths of thought or imagination.




BOOK IV: UNDER THE FLAGSTAFF


RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                            _May_ 1, 1907.

For some days after the last adventure I was in truth in a half-dazed
condition, unable to think sensibly, hardly coherently.  Indeed, it was
as much as I could do to preserve something of my habitual appearance and
manner.  However, my first test happily came soon, and when I was once
through it I reacquired sufficient self-confidence to go through with my
purpose.  Gradually the original phase of stupefaction passed, and I was
able to look the situation in the face.  I knew the worst now, at any
rate; and when the lowest point has been reached things must begin to
mend.  Still, I was wofully sensitive regarding anything which might
affect my Lady of the Shroud, or even my opinion of her.  I even began to
dread Aunt Janet's Second-Sight visions or dreams.  These had a fatal
habit of coming so near to fact that they always made for a danger of
discovery.  I had to realize now that the Lady of the Shroud might indeed
be a Vampire--one of that horrid race that survives death and carries on
a life-in-death existence eternally and only for evil.  Indeed, I began
to _expect_ that Aunt Janet would ere long have some prophetic insight to
the matter.  She had been so wonderfully correct in her prophetic
surmises with regard to both the visits to my room that it was hardly
possible that she could fail to take cognizance of this last development.

But my dread was not justified; at any rate, I had no reason to suspect
that by any force or exercise of her occult gift she might cause me
concern by the discovery of my secret.  Only once did I feel that actual
danger in that respect was close to me.  That was when she came early one
morning and rapped at my door.  When I called out, "Who is that?  What is
it?" she said in an agitated way:

"Thank God, laddie, you are all right!  Go to sleep again."

Later on, when we met at breakfast, she explained that she had had a
nightmare in the grey of the morning.  She thought she had seen me in the
crypt of a great church close beside a stone coffin; and, knowing that
such was an ominous subject to dream about, came as soon as she dared to
see if I was all right.  Her mind was evidently set on death and burial,
for she went on:

"By the way, Rupert, I am told that the great church on time top of the
cliff across the creek is St. Sava's, where the great people of the
country used to be buried.  I want you to take me there some day.  We
shall go over it, and look at the tombs and monuments together.  I really
think I should be afraid to go alone, but it will be all right if you are
with me."  This was getting really dangerous, so I turned it aside:

"Really, Aunt Janet, I'm afraid it won't do.  If you go off to weird old
churches, and fill yourself up with a fresh supply of horrors, I don't
know what will happen.  You'll be dreaming dreadful things about me every
night and neither you nor I shall get any sleep."  It went to my heart to
oppose her in any wish; and also this kind of chaffy opposition might
pain her.  But I had no alternative; the matter was too serious to be
allowed to proceed.  Should Aunt Janet go to the church, she would surely
want to visit the crypt.  Should she do so, and there notice the
glass-covered tomb--as she could not help doing--the Lord only knew what
would happen.  She had already Second-Sighted a woman being married to
me, and before I myself knew that I had such a hope.  What might she not
reveal did she know where the woman came from?  It may have been that her
power of Second Sight had to rest on some basis of knowledge or belief,
and that her vision was but some intuitive perception of my own
subjective thought.  But whatever it was it should be stopped--at all
hazards.

This whole episode set me thinking introspectively, and led me gradually
but imperatively to self-analysis--not of powers, but of motives.  I
found myself before long examining myself as to what were my real
intentions.  I thought at first that this intellectual process was an
exercise of pure reason; but soon discarded this as inadequate--even
impossible.  Reason is a cold manifestation; this feeling which swayed
and dominated me is none other than passion, which is quick, hot, and
insistent.

As for myself, the self-analysis could lead to but one result--the
expression to myself of the reality and definiteness of an already-formed
though unconscious intention.  I wished to do the woman good--to serve
her in some way--to secure her some benefit by any means, no matter how
difficult, which might be within my power.  I knew that I loved
her--loved her most truly and fervently; there was no need for
self-analysis to tell me that.  And, moreover, no self-analysis, or any
other mental process that I knew of, could help my one doubt: whether she
was an ordinary woman (or an extraordinary woman, for the matter of that)
in some sore and terrible straits; or else one who lay under some
dreadful condition, only partially alive, and not mistress of herself or
her acts.  Whichever her condition might be, there was in my own feeling
a superfluity of affection for her.  The self-analysis taught me one
thing, at any rate--that I had for her, to start with, an infinite pity
which had softened towards her my whole being, and had already mastered
merely selfish desire.  Out of it I began to find excuses for her every
act.  In the doing so I knew now, though perhaps I did not at the time
the process was going on, that my view in its true inwardness was of her
as a living woman--the woman I loved.

In the forming of our ideas there are different methods of work, as
though the analogy with material life holds good.  In the building of a
house, for instance, there are many persons employed; men of different
trades and occupations--architect, builder, masons, carpenters, plumbers,
and a host of others--and all these with the officials of each guild or
trade.  So in the world of thought and feelings: knowledge and
understanding come through various agents, each competent to its task.

How far pity reacted with love I knew not; I only knew that whatever her
state might be, were she living or dead, I could find in my heart no
blame for the Lady of the Shroud.  It could not be that she was dead in
the real conventional way; for, after all, the Dead do not walk the earth
in corporal substance, even if there be spirits which take the corporal
form.  This woman was of actual form and weight.  How could I doubt that,
at all events--I, who had held her in my arms?  Might it not be that she
was not quite dead, and that it had been given to me to restore her to
life again?  Ah! that would be, indeed, a privilege well worth the giving
my life to accomplish.  That such a thing may be is possible.  Surely the
old myths were not absolute inventions; they must have had a basis
somewhere in fact.  May not the world-old story of Orpheus and Eurydice
have been based on some deep-lying principle or power of human nature?
There is not one of us but has wished at some time to bring back the
dead.  Ay, and who has not felt that in himself or herself was power in
the deep love for our dead to make them quick again, did we but know the
secret of how it was to be done?

For myself, I have seen such mysteries that I am open to conviction
regarding things not yet explained.  These have been, of course, amongst
savages or those old-world people who have brought unchecked traditions
and beliefs--ay, and powers too--down the ages from the dim days when the
world was young; when forces were elemental, and Nature's handiwork was
experimental rather than completed.  Some of these wonders may have been
older still than the accepted period of our own period of creation.  May
we not have to-day other wonders, different only in method, but not more
susceptible of belief?  Obi-ism and Fantee-ism have been exercised in my
own presence, and their results proved by the evidence of my own eyes and
other senses.  So, too, have stranger rites, with the same object and the
same success, in the far Pacific Islands.  So, too, in India and China,
in Thibet and in the Golden Chersonese.  On all and each of these
occasions there was, on my own part, enough belief to set in motion the
powers of understanding; and there were no moral scruples to stand in the
way of realization.  Those whose lives are so spent that they achieve the
reputation of not fearing man or God or devil are not deterred in their
doing or thwarted from a set purpose by things which might deter others
not so equipped for adventure.  Whatever may be before them--pleasant or
painful, bitter or sweet, arduous or facile, enjoyable or terrible,
humorous or full of awe and horror--they must accept, taking them in the
onward course as a good athlete takes hurdles in his stride.  And there
must be no hesitating, no looking back.  If the explorer or the
adventurer has scruples, he had better give up that special branch of
effort and come himself to a more level walk in life.  Neither must there
be regrets.  There is no need for such; savage life has this advantage:
it begets a certain toleration not to be found in conventional existence.

                                                            _May_ 2, 1907.

I had heard long ago that Second Sight is a terrible gift, even to its
possessor.  I am now inclined not only to believe, but to understand it.
Aunt Janet has made such a practice of it of late that I go in constant
dread of discovery of my secret.  She seems to parallel me all the time,
whatever I may do.  It is like a sort of dual existence to her; for she
is her dear old self all the time, and yet some other person with a sort
of intellectual kit of telescope and notebook, which are eternally used
on me.  I know they are _for_ me, too--for what she considers my good.
But all the same it makes an embarrassment.  Happily Second Sight cannot
speak as clearly as it sees, or, rather, as it understands.  For the
translation of the vague beliefs which it inculcates is both nebulous and
uncertain--a sort of Delphic oracle which always says things which no one
can make out at the time, but which can be afterwards read in any one of
several ways.  This is all right, for in my case it is a kind of safety;
but, then, Aunt Janet is a very clever woman, and some time she herself
may be able to understand.  Then she may begin to put two and two
together.  When she does that, it will not be long before she knows more
than I do of the facts of the whole affair.  And her reading of them and
of the Lady of the Shroud, round whom they circle, may not be the same as
mine.  Well, that will be all right too.  Aunt Janet loves me--God knows
I have good reason to know that all through these years--and whatever
view she may take, her acts will be all I could wish.  But I shall come
in for a good lot of scolding, I am sure.  By the way, I ought to think
of that; if Aunt Janet scolds me, it is a pretty good proof that I ought
to be scolded.  I wonder if I dare tell her all.  No!  It is too strange.
She is only a woman, after all: and if she knew I loved . . . I wish I
knew her name, and thought--as I might myself do, only that I resist
it--that she is not alive at all.  Well, what she would either think or
do beats me.  I suppose she would want to slipper me as she used to do
when I was a wee kiddie--in a different way, of course.

                                                            _May_ 3, 1907.

I really could not go on seriously last night.  The idea of Aunt Janet
giving me a licking as in the dear old days made me laugh so much that
nothing in the world seemed serious then.  Oh, Aunt Janet is all right
whatever comes.  That I am sure of, so I needn't worry over it.  A good
thing too; there will be plenty to worry about without that.  I shall not
check her telling me of her visions, however; I may learn something from
them.

For the last four-and-twenty hours I have, whilst awake, been looking
over Aunt Janet's books, of which I brought a wheen down here.  Gee
whizz!  No wonder the old dear is superstitious, when she is filled up to
the back teeth with that sort of stuff!  There may be some truth in some
of those yarns; those who wrote them may believe in them, or some of
them, at all events.  But as to coherence or logic, or any sort of
reasonable or instructive deduction, they might as well have been written
by so many hens!  These occult book-makers seem to gather only a lot of
bare, bald facts, which they put down in the most uninteresting way
possible.  They go by quantity only.  One story of the kind, well
examined and with logical comments, would be more convincing to a third
party than a whole hecatomb of them.

                                                            _May_ 4, 1907.

There is evidently something up in the country.  The mountaineers are
more uneasy than they have been as yet.  There is constant going to and
fro amongst them, mostly at night and in the grey of the morning.  I
spend many hours in my room in the eastern tower, from which I can watch
the woods, and gather from signs the passing to and fro.  But with all
this activity no one has said to me a word on the subject.  It is
undoubtedly a disappointment to me.  I had hoped that the mountaineers
had come to trust me; that gathering at which they wanted to fire their
guns for me gave me strong hopes.  But now it is apparent that they do
not trust me in full--as yet, at all events.  Well, I must not complain.
It is all only right and just.  As yet I have done nothing to prove to
them the love and devotion that I feel to the country.  I know that such
individuals as I have met trust me, and I believe like me.  But the trust
of a nation is different.  That has to be won and tested; he who would
win it must justify, and in a way that only troublous times can allow.
No nation will--can--give full meed of honour to a stranger in times of
peace.  Why should it?  I must not forget that I am here a stranger in
the land, and that to the great mass of people even my name is unknown.
Perhaps they will know me better when Rooke comes back with that store of
arms and ammunition that he has bought, and the little warship he has got
from South America.  When they see that I hand over the whole lot to the
nation without a string on them, they may begin to believe.  In the
meantime all I can do is to wait.  It will all come right in time, I have
no doubt.  And if it doesn't come right, well, we can only die once!

Is that so?  What about my Lady of the Shroud?  I must not think of that
or of her in this gallery.  Love and war are separate, and may not
mix--cannot mix, if it comes to that.  I must be wise in the matter; and
if I have got the hump in any degree whatever, must not show it.

But one thing is certain: something is up, and it must be the Turks.
From what the Vladika said at that meeting they have some intention of an
attack on the Blue Mountains.  If that be so, we must be ready; and
perhaps I can help there.  The forces must be organized; we must have
some method of communication.  In this country, where are neither roads
nor railways nor telegraphs, we must establish a signalling system of
some sort.  _That_ I can begin at once.  I can make a code, or adapt one
that I have used elsewhere already.  I shall rig up a semaphore on the
top of the Castle which can be seen for an enormous distance around.  I
shall train a number of men to be facile in signalling.  And then, should
need come, I may be able to show the mountaineers that I am fit to live
in their hearts . . .

And all this work may prove an anodyne to pain of another kind.  It will
help, at any rate, to keep my mind occupied whilst I am waiting for
another visit from my Lady of the Shroud.

                                                           _May_ 18, 1907.

The two weeks that have passed have been busy, and may, as time goes on,
prove eventful.  I really think they have placed me in a different
position with the Blue Mountaineers--certainly so far as those in this
part of the country are concerned.  They are no longer suspicious of
me--which is much; though they have not yet received me into their
confidence.  I suppose this will come in time, but I must not try to
hustle them.  Already they are willing, so far as I can see, to use me to
their own ends.  They accepted the signalling idea very readily, and are
quite willing to drill as much as I like.  This can be (and I think is,
in its way) a pleasure to them.  They are born soldiers, every man of
them; and practice together is only a realization of their own wishes and
a further development of their powers.  I think I can understand the
trend of their thoughts, and what ideas of public policy lie behind them.
In all that we have attempted together as yet they are themselves in
absolute power.  It rests with them to carry out any ideas I may suggest,
so they do not fear any assumption of power or governance on my part.
Thus, so long as they keep secret from me both their ideas of high policy
and their immediate intentions, I am powerless to do them ill, and I
_may_ be of service should occasion arise.  Well, all told, this is much.
Already they accept me as an individual, not merely one of the mass.  I
am pretty sure that they are satisfied of my personal _bona fides_.  It
is policy and not mistrust that hedges me in.  Well, policy is a matter
of time.  They are a splendid people, but if they knew a little more than
they do they would understand that the wisest of all policies is
trust--when it can be given.  I must hold myself in check, and never be
betrayed into a harsh thought towards them.  Poor souls! with a thousand
years behind them of Turkish aggression, strenuously attempted by both
force and fraud, no wonder they are suspicious.  Likewise every other
nation with whom they have ever come in contact--except one, my own--has
deceived or betrayed them.  Anyhow, they are fine soldiers, and before
long we shall have an army that cannot be ignored.  If I can get so that
they trust me, I shall ask Sir Colin to come out here.  He would be a
splendid head for their army.  His great military knowledge and tactical
skill would come in well.  It makes me glow to think of what an army he
would turn out of this splendid material, and one especially adapted for
the style of fighting which would be necessary in this country.

If a mere amateur like myself, who has only had experience of organizing
the wildest kind of savages, has been able to advance or compact their
individual style of fighting into systematic effort, a great soldier like
MacKelpie will bring them to perfection as a fighting machine.  Our
Highlanders, when they come out, will foregather with them, as
mountaineers always do with each other.  Then we shall have a force which
can hold its own against any odds.  I only hope that Rooke will be
returning soon.  I want to see those Ingis-Malbron rifles either safely
stored in the Castle or, what is better, divided up amongst the
mountaineers--a thing which will be done at the very earliest moment that
I can accomplish it.  I have a conviction that when these men have
received their arms and ammunition from me they will understand me
better, and not keep any secrets from me.

All this fortnight when I was not drilling or going about amongst the
mountaineers, and teaching them the code which I have now got perfected,
I was exploring the side of the mountain nearest to here.  I could not
bear to be still.  It is torture to me to be idle in my present condition
of mind regarding my Lady of the Shroud . . . Strange I do not mind
mentioning the word to myself now.  I used to at first; but that
bitterness has all gone away.



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--Continued.


                                                           _May_ 19, 1907.

I was so restless early this morning that before daylight I was out
exploring on the mountain-side.  By chance I came across a secret place
just as the day was breaking.  Indeed, it was by the change of light as
the first sun-rays seemed to fall down the mountain-side that my
attention was called to an opening shown by a light behind it.  It was,
indeed, a secret place--so secret that I thought at first I should keep
it to myself.  In such a place as this either to hide in or to be able to
prevent anyone else hiding in might on occasion be an asset of safety.

When, however, I saw indications rather than traces that someone had
already used it to camp in, I changed my mind, and thought that whenever
I should get an opportunity I would tell the Vladika of it, as he is a
man on whose discretion I can rely.  If we ever have a war here or any
sort of invasion, it is just such places that may be dangerous.  Even in
my own case it is much too near the Castle to be neglected.

The indications were meagre--only where a fire had been on a little shelf
of rock; and it was not possible, through the results of burning
vegetation or scorched grass, to tell how long before the fire had been
alight.  I could only guess.  Perhaps the mountaineers might be able to
tell or even to guess better than I could.  But I am not so sure of this.
I am a mountaineer myself, and with larger and more varied experience
than any of them.  For myself, though I could not be certain, I came to
the conclusion that whoever had used the place had done so not many days
before.  It could not have been quite recently; but it may not have been
very long ago.  Whoever had used it had covered up his tracks well.  Even
the ashes had been carefully removed, and the place where they had lain
was cleaned or swept in some way, so that there was no trace on the spot.
I applied some of my West African experience, and looked on the rough
bark of the trees to leeward, to where the agitated air, however
directed, must have come, unless it was wanted to call attention to the
place by the scattered wood-ashes, however fine.  I found traces of it,
but they were faint.  There had not been rain for several days; so the
dust must have been blown there since the rain had fallen, for it was
still dry.

The place was a tiny gorge, with but one entrance, which was hidden
behind a barren spur of rock--just a sort of long fissure, jagged and
curving, in the rock, like a fault in the stratification.  I could just
struggle through it with considerable effort, holding my breath here and
there, so as to reduce my depth of chest.  Within it was tree-clad, and
full of possibilities of concealment.

As I came away I marked well its direction and approaches, noting any
guiding mark which might aid in finding it by day or night.  I explored
every foot of ground around it--in front, on each side, and above.  But
from nowhere could I see an indication of its existence.  It was a
veritable secret chamber wrought by the hand of Nature itself.  I did not
return home till I was familiar with every detail near and around it.
This new knowledge added distinctly to my sense of security.

Later in the day I tried to find the Vladika or any mountaineer of
importance, for I thought that such a hiding-place which had been used so
recently might be dangerous, and especially at a time when, as I had
learned at the meeting where they did _not_ fire their guns that there
may have been spies about or a traitor in the land.

Even before I came to my own room to-night I had fully made up my mind to
go out early in the morning and find some proper person to whom to impart
the information, so that a watch might be kept on the place.  It is now
getting on for midnight, and when I have had my usual last look at the
garden I shall turn in.  Aunt Janet was uneasy all day, and especially so
this evening.  I think it must have been my absence at the usual
breakfast-hour which got on her nerves; and that unsatisfied mental or
psychical irritation increased as the day wore on.

                                                           _May_ 20, 1907.

The clock on the mantelpiece in my room, which chimes on the notes of the
clock at St. James's Palace, was striking midnight when I opened the
glass door on the terrace.  I had put out my lights before I drew the
curtain, as I wished to see the full effect of the moonlight.  Now that
the rainy season is over, the moon is quite as beautiful as it was in the
wet, and a great deal more comfortable.  I was in evening dress, with a
smoking-jacket in lieu of a coat, and I felt the air mild and mellow on
the warm side, as I stood on the terrace.

But even in that bright moonlight the further corners of the great garden
were full of mysterious shadows.  I peered into them as well as I
could--and my eyes are pretty good naturally, and are well trained.
There was not the least movement.  The air was as still as death, the
foliage as still as though wrought in stone.

I looked for quite a long time in the hope of seeing something of my
Lady.  The quarters chimed several times, but I stood on unheeding.  At
last I thought I saw far off in the very corner of the old defending wall
a flicker of white.  It was but momentary, and could hardly have
accounted in itself for the way my heart beat.  I controlled myself, and
stood as though I, too, were a graven image.  I was rewarded by seeing
presently another gleam of white.  And then an unspeakable rapture stole
over me as I realized that my Lady was coming as she had come before.  I
would have hurried out to meet her, but that I knew well that this would
not be in accord with her wishes.  So, thinking to please her, I drew
back into the room.  I was glad I had done so when, from the dark corner
where I stood, I saw her steal up the marble steps and stand timidly
looking in at the door.  Then, after a long pause, came a whisper as
faint and sweet as the music of a distant AEolian harp:

"Are you there?  May I come in?  Answer me!  I am lonely and in fear!"
For answer I emerged from my dim corner so swiftly that she was startled.
I could hear from the quivering intake of her breath that she was
striving--happily with success--to suppress a shriek.

"Come in," I said quietly.  "I was waiting for you, for I felt that you
would come.  I only came in from the terrace when I saw you coming, lest
you might fear that anyone might see us.  That is not possible, but I
thought you wished that I should be careful."

"I did--I do," she answered in a low, sweet voice, but very firmly.  "But
never avoid precaution.  There is nothing that may not happen here.
There may be eyes where we least expect--or suspect them."  As she spoke
the last words solemnly and in a low whisper, she was entering the room.
I closed the glass door and bolted it, rolled back the steel grille, and
pulled the heavy curtain.  Then, when I had lit a candle, I went over and
put a light to the fire.  In a few seconds the dry wood had caught, and
the flames were beginning to rise and crackle.  She had not objected to
my closing the window and drawing the curtain; neither did she make any
comment on my lighting the fire.  She simply acquiesced in it, as though
it was now a matter of course.  When I made the pile of cushions before
it as on the occasion of her last visit, she sank down on them, and held
out her white, trembling hands to the warmth.

She was different to-night from what she had been on either of the two
former visits.  From her present bearing I arrived at some gauge of her
self-concern, her self-respect.  Now that she was dry, and not
overmastered by wet and cold, a sweet and gracious dignity seemed to
shine from her, enwrapping her, as it were, with a luminous veil.  It was
not that she was by this made or shown as cold or distant, or in any way
harsh or forbidding.  On the contrary, protected by this dignity, she
seemed much more sweet and genial than before.  It was as though she felt
that she could afford to stoop now that her loftiness was realized--that
her position was recognized and secure.  If her inherent dignity made an
impenetrable nimbus round her, this was against others; she herself was
not bound by it, or to be bound.  So marked was this, so entirely and
sweetly womanly did she appear, that I caught myself wondering in flashes
of thought, which came as sharp periods of doubting judgment between
spells of unconscious fascination, how I had ever come to think she was
aught but perfect woman.  As she rested, half sitting and half lying on
the pile of cushions, she was all grace, and beauty, and charm, and
sweetness--the veritable perfect woman of the dreams of a man, be he
young or old.  To have such a woman sit by his hearth and hold her holy
of holies in his heart might well be a rapture to any man.  Even an hour
of such entrancing joy might be well won by a lifetime of pain, by the
balance of a long life sacrificed, by the extinction of life itself.
Quick behind the record of such thoughts came the answer to the doubt
they challenged: if it should turn out that she was not living at all,
but one of the doomed and pitiful Un-Dead, then so much more on account
of her very sweetness and beauty would be the winning of her back to Life
and Heaven--even were it that she might find happiness in the heart and
in the arms of another man.

Once, when I leaned over the hearth to put fresh logs on the fire, my
face was so close to hers that I felt her breath on my cheek.  It
thrilled me to feel even the suggestion of that ineffable contact.  Her
breath was sweet--sweet as the breath of a calf, sweet as the whiff of a
summer breeze across beds of mignonette.  How could anyone believe for a
moment that such sweet breath could come from the lips of the dead--the
dead _in esse_ or _in posse_--that corruption could send forth fragrance
so sweet and pure?  It was with satisfied happiness that, as I looked at
her from my stool, I saw the dancing of the flames from the beech-logs
reflected in her glorious black eyes, and the stars that were hidden in
them shine out with new colours and new lustre as they gleamed, rising
and falling like hopes and fears.  As the light leaped, so did smiles of
quiet happiness flit over her beautiful face, the merriment of the joyous
flames being reflected in ever-changing dimples.

At first I was a little disconcerted whenever my eyes took note of her
shroud, and there came a momentary regret that the weather had not been
again bad, so that there might have been compulsion for her putting on
another garment--anything lacking the loathsomeness of that pitiful
wrapping.  Little by little, however, this feeling disappeared, and I
found no matter for even dissatisfaction in her wrapping.  Indeed, my
thoughts found inward voice before the subject was dismissed from my
mind:

"One becomes accustomed to anything--even a shroud!"  But the thought was
followed by a submerging wave of pity that she should have had such a
dreadful experience.

By-and-by we seemed both to forget everything--I know I did--except that
we were man and woman, and close together.  The strangeness of the
situation and the circumstances did not seem of moment--not worth even a
passing thought.  We still sat apart and said little, if anything.  I
cannot recall a single word that either of us spoke whilst we sat before
the fire, but other language than speech came into play; the eyes told
their own story, as eyes can do, and more eloquently than lips whilst
exercising their function of speech.  Question and answer followed each
other in this satisfying language, and with an unspeakable rapture I
began to realize that my affection was returned.  Under these
circumstances it was unrealizable that there should be any incongruity in
the whole affair.  I was not myself in the mood of questioning.  I was
diffident with that diffidence which comes alone from true love, as
though it were a necessary emanation from that delightful and
overwhelming and commanding passion.  In her presence there seemed to
surge up within me that which forbade speech.  Speech under present
conditions would have seemed to me unnecessary, imperfect, and even
vulgarly overt.  She, too, was silent.  But now that I am alone, and
memory is alone with me, I am convinced that she also had been happy.
No, not that exactly.  "Happiness" is not the word to describe either her
feeling or my own.  Happiness is more active, a more conscious enjoyment.
We had been content.  That expresses our condition perfectly; and now
that I can analyze my own feeling, and understand what the word implies,
I am satisfied of its accuracy.  "Content" has both a positive and
negative meaning or antecedent condition.  It implies an absence of
disturbing conditions as well as of wants; also it implies something
positive which has been won or achieved, or which has accrued.  In our
state of mind--for though it may be presumption on my part, I am
satisfied that our ideas were mutual--it meant that we had reached an
understanding whence all that might come must be for good.  God grant
that it may be so!

As we sat silent, looking into each other's eyes, and whilst the stars in
hers were now full of latent fire, perhaps from the reflection of the
flames, she suddenly sprang to her feet, instinctively drawing the
horrible shroud round her as she rose to her full height in a voice full
of lingering emotion, as of one who is acting under spiritual compulsion
rather than personal will, she said in a whisper:

"I must go at once.  I feel the morning drawing nigh.  I must be in my
place when the light of day comes."

She was so earnest that I felt I must not oppose her wish; so I, too,
sprang to my feet and ran towards the window.  I pulled the curtain aside
sufficiently far for me to press back the grille and reach the glass
door, the latch of which I opened.  I passed behind the curtain again,
and held the edge of it back so that she could go through.  For an
instant she stopped as she broke the long silence:

"You are a true gentleman, and my friend.  You understand all I wish.
Out of the depth of my heart I thank you."  She held out her beautiful
high-bred hand.  I took it in both mine as I fell on my knees, and raised
it to my lips.  Its touch made me quiver.  She, too, trembled as she
looked down at me with a glance which seemed to search my very soul.  The
stars in her eyes, now that the firelight was no longer on them, had gone
back to their own mysterious silver.  Then she drew her hand from mine
very, very gently, as though it would fain linger; and she passed out
behind the curtain with a gentle, sweet, dignified little bow which left
me on my knees.

When I heard the glass door pulled-to gently behind her, I rose from my
knees and hurried without the curtain, just in time to watch her pass
down the steps.  I wanted to see her as long as I could.  The grey of
morning was just beginning to war with the night gloom, and by the faint
uncertain light I could see dimly the white figure flit between shrub and
statue till finally it merged in the far darkness.

I stood for a long time on the terrace, sometimes looking into the
darkness in front of me, in case I might be blessed with another glimpse
of her; sometimes with my eyes closed, so that I might recall and hold in
my mind her passage down the steps.  For the first time since I had met
her she had thrown back at me a glance as she stepped on the white path
below the terrace.  With the glamour over me of that look, which was all
love and enticement, I could have dared all the powers that be.

When the grey dawn was becoming apparent through the lightening of the
sky I returned to my room.  In a dazed condition--half hypnotized by
love--I went to bed, and in dreams continued to think, all happily, of my
Lady of the Shroud.

                                                           _May_ 27, 1907.

A whole week has gone since I saw my Love!  There it is; no doubt
whatever is left in my mind about it now!  Since I saw her my passion has
grown and grown by leaps and bounds, as novelists put it.  It has now
become so vast as to overwhelm me, to wipe out all thought of doubt or
difficulty.  I suppose it must be what men suffered--suffering need not
mean pain--under enchantments in old times.  I am but as a straw whirled
in the resistless eddies of a whirlpool.  I feel that I _must_ see her
again, even if it be but in her tomb in the crypt.  I must, I suppose,
prepare myself for the venture, for many things have to be thought of.
The visit must not be at night, for in such case I might miss her, did
she come to me again here . . .

The morning came and went, but my wish and intention still remained; and
so in the full tide of noon, with the sun in all its fiery force, I set
out for the old church of St. Sava.  I carried with me a lantern with
powerful lens.  I had wrapped it up secretly, for I had a feeling that I
should not like anyone to know that I had such a thing with me.

On this occasion I had no misgivings.  On the former visit I had for a
moment been overwhelmed at the unexpected sight of the body of the woman
I thought I loved--I knew it now--lying in her tomb.  But now I knew all,
and it was to see this woman, though in her tomb, that I came.

When I had lit my lantern, which I did as soon as I had pushed open the
great door, which was once again unlocked, I turned my steps to the steps
of the crypt, which lay behind the richly carven wood screen.  This I
could see, with the better light, was a noble piece of work of priceless
beauty and worth.  I tried to keep my heart in full courage with thoughts
of my Lady, and of the sweetness and dignity of our last meeting; but,
despite all, it sank down, down, and turned to water as I passed with
uncertain feet down the narrow, tortuous steps.  My concern, I am now
convinced, was not for myself, but that she whom I adored should have to
endure such a fearful place.  As anodyne to my own pain I thought what it
would be, and how I should feel, when I should have won for her a way out
of that horror, at any rate.  This thought reassured me somewhat, and
restored my courage.  It was in something of the same fashion which has
hitherto carried me out of tight places as well as into them that at last
I pushed open the low, narrow door at the foot of the rock-hewn staircase
and entered the crypt.

Without delay I made my way to the glass-covered tomb set beneath the
hanging chain.  I could see by the flashing of the light around me that
my hand which held the lantern trembled.  With a great effort I steadied
myself, and raising the lantern, turned its light down into the
sarcophagus.

Once again the fallen lantern rang on the tingling glass, and I stood
alone in the darkness, for an instant almost paralyzed with surprised
disappointment.

The tomb was empty!  Even the trappings of the dead had been removed.

I knew not what happened till I found myself groping my way up the
winding stair.  Here, in comparison with the solid darkness of the crypt,
it seemed almost light.  The dim expanse of the church sent a few
straggling rays down the vaulted steps, and as I could see, be it never
so dimly, I felt I was not in absolute darkness.  With the light came a
sense of power and fresh courage, and I groped my way back into the crypt
again.  There, by now and again lighting matches, I found my way to the
tomb and recovered my lantern.  Then I took my way slowly--for I wished
to prove, if not my own courage, at least such vestiges of self-respect
as the venture had left me--through the church, where I extinguished my
lantern, and out through the great door into the open sunlight.  I seemed
to have heard, both in the darkness of the crypt and through the dimness
of the church, mysterious sounds as of whispers and suppressed breathing;
but the memory of these did not count for much when once I was free.  I
was only satisfied of my own consciousness and identity when I found
myself on the broad rock terrace in front of the church, with the fierce
sunlight beating on my upturned face, and, looking downward, saw far
below me the rippled blue of the open sea.

                                                           _June_ 3, 1907.

Another week has elapsed--a week full of movement of many kinds and in
many ways--but as yet I have had no tale or tidings of my Lady of the
Shroud.  I have not had an opportunity of going again in daylight to St.
Sava's as I should have liked to have done.  I felt that I must not go at
night.  The night is her time of freedom, and it must be kept for her--or
else I may miss her, or perhaps never see her again.

The days have been full of national movement.  The mountaineers have
evidently been organizing themselves, for some reason which I cannot
quite understand, and which they have hesitated to make known to me.  I
have taken care not to manifest any curiosity, whatever I may have felt.
This would certainly arouse suspicion, and might ultimately cause
disaster to my hopes of aiding the nation in their struggle to preserve
their freedom.

These fierce mountaineers are strangely--almost unduly--suspicious, and
the only way to win their confidence is to begin the trusting.  A young
American attache of the Embassy at Vienna, who had made a journey through
the Land of the Blue Mountains, once put it to me in this form:

"Keep your head shut, and they'll open theirs.  If you don't, they'll
open it for you--down to the chine!"

It was quite apparent to me that they were completing some fresh
arrangements for signalling with a code of their own.  This was natural
enough, and in no way inconsistent with the measure of friendliness
already shown to me.  Where there are neither telegraphs, railways, nor
roads, any effective form of communication must--can only be purely
personal.  And so, if they wish to keep any secret amongst themselves,
they must preserve the secret of their code.  I should have dearly liked
to learn their new code and their manner of using it, but as I want to be
a helpful friend to them--and as this implies not only trust, but the
appearance of it--I had to school myself to patience.

This attitude so far won their confidence that before we parted at our
last meeting, after most solemn vows of faith and secrecy, they took me
into the secret.  This was, however, only to the extent of teaching me
the code and method; they still withheld from me rigidly the fact or
political secret, or whatever it was that was the mainspring of their
united action.

When I got home I wrote down, whilst it was fresh in my memory, all they
told me.  This script I studied until I had it so thoroughly by heart
that I _could_ not forget it.  Then I burned the paper.  However, there
is now one gain at least: with my semaphore I can send through the Blue
Mountains from side to side, with expedition, secrecy, and exactness, a
message comprehensible to all.



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                           _June_ 6, 1907.

Last night I had a new experience of my Lady of the Shroud--in so far as
form was concerned, at any rate.  I was in bed, and just falling asleep,
when I heard a queer kind of scratching at the glass door of the terrace.
I listened acutely, my heart beating hard.  The sound seemed to come from
low down, close to the floor.  I jumped out of bed, ran to the window,
and, pulling aside the heavy curtains, looked out.

The garden looked, as usual, ghostly in the moonlight, but there was not
the faintest sign of movement anywhere, and no one was on or near the
terrace.  I looked eagerly down to where the sound had seemed to come
from.

There, just inside the glass door, as though it had been pushed under the
door, lay a paper closely folded in several laps.  I picked it up and
opened it.  I was all in a tumult, for my heart told me whence it came.
Inside was written in English, in a large, sprawling hand, such as might
be from an English child of seven or eight:

"Meet me at the Flagstaff on the Rock!"

I knew the place, of course.  On the farthermost point of the rock on
which the Castle stands is set a high flagstaff, whereon in old time the
banner of the Vissarion family flew.  At some far-off time, when the
Castle had been liable to attack, this point had been strongly fortified.
Indeed, in the days when the bow was a martial weapon it must have been
quite impregnable.

A covered gallery, with loopholes for arrows, had been cut in the solid
rock, running right round the point, quite surrounding the flagstaff and
the great boss of rock on whose centre it was reared.  A narrow
drawbridge of immense strength had connected--in peaceful times, and
still remained--the outer point of rock with an entrance formed in the
outer wall, and guarded with flanking towers and a portcullis.  Its use
was manifestly to guard against surprise.  From this point only could be
seen the line of the rocks all round the point.  Thus, any secret attack
by boats could be made impossible.

Having hurriedly dressed myself, and taking with me both hunting-knife
and revolver, I went out on the terrace, taking the precaution, unusual
to me, of drawing the grille behind me and locking it.  Matters around
the Castle are in far too disturbed a condition to allow the taking of
any foolish chances, either in the way of being unarmed or of leaving the
private entrance to the Castle open.  I found my way through the rocky
passage, and climbed by the Jacob's ladder fixed on the rock--a device of
convenience in time of peace--to the foot of the flagstaff.

I was all on fire with expectation, and the time of going seemed
exceeding long; so I was additionally disappointed by the contrast when I
did not see my Lady there when I arrived.  However, my heart beat freely
again--perhaps more freely than ever--when I saw her crouching in the
shadow of the Castle wall.  From where she was she could not be seen from
any point save that alone which I occupied; even from there it was only
her white shroud that was conspicuous through the deep gloom of the
shadow.  The moonlight was so bright that the shadows were almost
unnaturally black.

I rushed over towards her, and when close was about to say impulsively,
"Why did you leave your tomb?" when it suddenly struck me that the
question would be malapropos and embarrassing in many ways.  So, better
judgment prevailing, I said instead:

"It has been so long since I saw you!  It has seemed an eternity to me!"
Her answer came as quickly as even I could have wished; she spoke
impulsively and without thought:

"It has been long to me too!  Oh, so long! so long!  I have asked you to
come out here because I wanted to see you so much that I could not wait
any longer.  I have been heart-hungry for a sight of you!"

Her words, her eager attitude, the ineffable something which conveys the
messages of the heart, the longing expression in her eyes as the full
moonlight fell on her face, showing the stars as living gold--for in her
eagerness she had stepped out towards me from the shadow--all set me on
fire.  Without a thought or a word--for it was Nature speaking in the
language of Love, which is a silent tongue--I stepped towards her and
took her in my arms.  She yielded with that sweet unconsciousness which
is the perfection of Love, as if it was in obedience to some command
uttered before the beginning of the world.  Probably without any
conscious effort on either side--I know there was none on mine--our
mouths met in the first kiss of love.

At the time nothing in the meeting struck me as out of the common.  But
later in the night, when I was alone and in darkness, whenever I thought
of it all--its strangeness and its stranger rapture--I could not but be
sensible of the bizarre conditions for a love meeting.  The place lonely,
the time night, the man young and strong, and full of life and hope and
ambition; the woman, beautiful and ardent though she was, a woman
seemingly dead, clothed in the shroud in which she had been wrapped when
lying in her tomb in the crypt of the old church.

Whilst we were together, anyhow, there was little thought of the kind; no
reasoning of any kind on my part.  Love has its own laws and its own
logic.  Under the flagstaff, where the Vissarion banner was wont to flap
in the breeze, she was in my arms; her sweet breath was on my face; her
heart was beating against my own.  What need was there for reason at all?
_Inter arma silent leges_--the voice of reason is silent in the stress of
passion.  Dead she may be, or Un-dead--a Vampire with one foot in Hell
and one on earth.  But I love her; and come what may, here or hereafter,
she is mine.  As my mate, we shall fare along together, whatsoever the
end may be, or wheresoever our path may lead.  If she is indeed to be won
from the nethermost Hell, then be mine the task!

But to go back to the record.  When I had once started speaking to her in
words of passion I could not stop.  I did not want to--if I could; and
she did not appear to wish it either.  Can there be a woman--alive or
dead--who would not want to hear the rapture of her lover expressed to
her whilst she is enclosed in his arms?

There was no attempt at reticence on my part now; I took it for granted
that she knew all that I surmised, and, as she made neither protest nor
comment, that she accepted my belief as to her indeterminate existence.
Sometimes her eyes would be closed, but even then the rapture of her face
was almost beyond belief.  Then, when the beautiful eyes would open and
gaze on me, the stars that were in them would shine and scintillate as
though they were formed of living fire.  She said little, very little;
but though the words were few, every syllable was fraught with love, and
went straight to the very core of my heart.

By-and-by, when our transport had calmed to joy, I asked when I might
next see her, and how and where I might find her when I should want to.
She did not reply directly, but, holding me close in her arms, whispered
in my ear with that breathless softness which is a lover's rapture of
speech:

"I have come here under terrible difficulties, not only because I love
you--and that would be enough--but because, as well as the joy of seeing
you, I wanted to warn you."

"To warn me!  Why?" I queried.  Her reply came with a bashful hesitation,
with something of a struggle in it, as of one who for some ulterior
reason had to pick her words:

"There are difficulties and dangers ahead of you.  You are beset with
them; and they are all the greater because they are, of grim necessity,
hidden from you.  You cannot go anywhere, look in any direction, do
anything, say anything, but it may be a signal for danger.  My dear, it
lurks everywhere--in the light as well as in the darkness; in the open as
well as in the secret places; from friends as well as foes; when you are
least prepared; when you may least expect it.  Oh, I know it, and what it
is to endure; for I share it for you--for your dear sake!"

"My darling!" was all I could say, as I drew her again closer to me and
kissed her.  After a bit she was calmer; seeing this, I came back to the
subject that she had--in part, at all events--come to me to speak about:

"But if difficulty and danger hedge me in so everlastingly, and if I am
to have no indication whatever of its kind or purpose, what can I do?
God knows I would willingly guard myself--not on my own account, but for
your dear sake.  I have now a cause to live and be strong, and to keep
all my faculties, since it may mean much to you.  If you may not tell me
details, may you not indicate to me some line of conduct, of action, that
would be most in accord with your wishes--or, rather, with your idea of
what would be best?"

She looked at me fixedly before speaking--a long, purposeful, loving look
which no man born of woman could misunderstand.  Then she spoke slowly,
deliberately, emphatically:

"Be bold, and fear not.  Be true to yourself, to me--it is the same
thing.  These are the best guards you can use.  Your safety does not rest
with me.  Ah, I wish it did!  I wish to God it did!"  In my inner heart
it thrilled me not merely to hear the expression of her wish, but to hear
her use the name of God as she did.  I understand now, in the calm of
this place and with the sunlight before me, that my belief as to her
being all woman--living woman--was not quite dead: but though at the
moment my heart did not recognize the doubt, my brain did.  And I made up
my mind that we should not part this time until she knew that I had seen
her, and where; but, despite my own thoughts, my outer ears listened
greedily as she went on.

"As for me, you may not find _me_, but _I_ shall find _you_, be sure!
And now we must say 'Good-night,' my dear, my dear!  Tell me once again
that you love me, for it is a sweetness that one does not wish to
forego--even one who wears such a garment as this--and rests where I must
rest."  As she spoke she held up part of her cerements for me to see.
What could I do but take her once again in my arms and hold her close,
close.  God knows it was all in love; but it was passionate love which
surged through my every vein as I strained her dear body to mine.  But
yet this embrace was not selfish; it was not all an expression of my own
passion.  It was based on pity--the pity which is twin-born with true
love.  Breathless from our kisses, when presently we released each other,
she stood in a glorious rapture, like a white spirit in the moonlight,
and as her lovely, starlit eyes seemed to devour me, she spoke in a
languorous ecstasy:

"Oh, how you love me! how you love me!  It is worth all I have gone
through for this, even to wearing this terrible drapery."  And again she
pointed to her shroud.

Here was my chance to speak of what I knew, and I took it.  "I know, I
know.  Moreover, I know that awful resting-place."

I was interrupted, cut short in the midst of my sentence, not by any
word, but by the frightened look in her eyes and the fear-mastered way in
which she shrank away from me.  I suppose in reality she could not be
paler than she looked when the colour-absorbing moonlight fell on her;
but on the instant all semblance of living seemed to shrink and fall
away, and she looked with eyes of dread as if in I some awful way held in
thrall.  But for the movement of the pitiful glance, she would have
seemed of soulless marble, so deadly cold did she look.

The moments that dragged themselves out whilst I waited for her to speak
seemed endless.  At length her words came in an awed whisper, so faint
that even in that stilly night I could hardly hear it:

"You know--you know my resting-place!  How--when was that?"  There was
nothing to do now but to speak out the truth:

"I was in the crypt of St. Sava.  It was all by accident.  I was
exploring all around the Castle, and I went there in my course.  I found
the winding stair in the rock behind the screen, and went down.  Dear, I
loved you well before that awful moment, but then, even as the lantern
fell tingling on the glass, my love multiplied itself, with pity as a
factor."  She was silent for a few seconds.  When she spoke, there was a
new tone in her voice:

"But were you not shocked?"

"Of course I was," I answered on the spur of the moment, and I now think
wisely.  "Shocked is hardly the word.  I was horrified beyond anything
that words can convey that you--_you_ should have to so endure!  I did
not like to return, for I feared lest my doing so might set some barrier
between us.  But in due time I did return on another day."

"Well?"  Her voice was like sweet music.

"I had another shock that time, worse than before, for you were not
there.  Then indeed it was that I knew to myself how dear you were--how
dear you are to me.  Whilst I live, you--living or dead--shall always be
in my heart."  She breathed hard.  The elation in her eyes made them
outshine the moonlight, but she said no word.  I went on:

"My dear, I had come into the crypt full of courage and hope, though I
knew what dreadful sight should sear my eyes once again.  But we little
know what may be in store for us, no matter what we expect.  I went out
with a heart like water from that dreadful desolation."

"Oh, how you love me, dear!"  Cheered by her words, and even more by her
tone, I went on with renewed courage.  There was no halting, no faltering
in my intention now:

"You and I, my dear, were ordained for each other.  I cannot help it that
you had already suffered before I knew you.  It may be that there may be
for you still suffering that I may not prevent, endurance that I may not
shorten; but what a man can do is yours.  Not Hell itself will stop me,
if it be possible that I may win through its torments with you in my
arms!"

"Will nothing stop you, then?"  Her question was breathed as softly as
the strain of an AEolian harp.

"Nothing!" I said, and I heard my own teeth snap together.  There was
something speaking within me stronger than I had ever known myself to be.
Again came a query, trembling, quavering, quivering, as though the issue
was of more than life or death:

"Not this?"  She held up a corner of the shroud, and as she saw my face
and realized the answer before I spoke, went on: "With all it implies?"

"Not if it were wrought of the cerecloths of the damned!"  There was a
long pause.  Her voice was more resolute when she spoke again.  It rang.
Moreover, there was in it a joyous note, as of one who feels new hope:

"But do you know what men say?  Some of them, that I am dead and buried;
others, that I am not only dead and buried, but that I am one of those
unhappy beings that may not die the common death of man.  Who live on a
fearful life-in-death, whereby they are harmful to all.  Those unhappy
Un-dead whom men call Vampires--who live on the blood of the living, and
bring eternal damnation as well as death with the poison of their
dreadful kisses!

"I know what men say sometimes," I answered.  "But I know also what my
own heart says; and I rather choose to obey its calling than all the
voices of the living or the dead.  Come what may, I am pledged to you.
If it be that your old life has to be rewon for you out of the very jaws
of Death and Hell, I shall keep the faith I have pledged, and that here I
pledge again!"  As I finished speaking I sank on my knees at her feet,
and, putting my arms round her, drew her close to me.  Her tears rained
down on my face as she stroked my hair with her soft, strong hand and
whispered to me:

"This is indeed to be one.  What more holy marriage can God give to any
of His creatures?"  We were both silent for a time.

I think I was the first to recover my senses.  That I did so was manifest
by my asking her: "When may we meet again?"--a thing I had never
remembered doing at any of our former partings.  She answered with a
rising and falling of the voice that was just above a whisper, as soft
and cooing as the voice of a pigeon:

"That will be soon--as soon as I can manage it, be sure.  My dear, my
dear!"  The last four words of endearment she spoke in a low but
prolonged and piercing tone which made me thrill with delight.

"Give me some token," I said, "that I may have always close to me to ease
my aching heart till we meet again, and ever after, for love's sake!"
Her mind seemed to leap to understanding, and with a purpose all her own.
Stooping for an instant, she tore off with swift, strong fingers a
fragment of her shroud.  This, having kissed it, she handed to me,
whispering:

"It is time that we part.  You must leave me now.  Take this, and keep it
for ever.  I shall be less unhappy in my terrible loneliness whilst it
lasts if I know that this my gift, which for good or ill is a part of me
as you know me, is close to you.  It may be, my very dear, that some day
you may be glad and even proud of this hour, as I am."  She kissed me as
I took it.

"For life or death, I care not which, so long as I am with you!" I said,
as I moved off.  Descending the Jacob's ladder, I made my way down the
rock-hewn passage.

The last thing I saw was the beautiful face of my Lady of the Shroud as
she leaned over the edge of the opening.  Her eyes were like glowing
stars as her looks followed me.  That look shall never fade from my
memory.

After a few agitating moments of thought I half mechanically took my way
down to the garden.  Opening the grille, I entered my lonely room, which
looked all the more lonely for the memory of the rapturous moments under
the Flagstaff.  I went to bed as one in a dream.  There I lay till
sunrise--awake and thinking.




BOOK V: A RITUAL AT MIDNIGHT


RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                          _June_ 20, 1907.

The time has gone as quickly as work can effect since I saw my Lady.  As
I told the mountaineers, Rooke, whom I had sent on the service, had made
a contract for fifty thousand Ingis-Malbron rifles, and as many tons of
ammunition as the French experts calculated to be a full supply for a
year of warfare.  I heard from him by our secret telegraph code that the
order had been completed, and that the goods were already on the way.
The morning after the meeting at the Flagstaff I had word that at night
the vessel--one chartered by Rooke for the purpose--would arrive at
Vissarion during the night.  We were all expectation.  I had always now
in the Castle a signalling party, the signals being renewed as fast as
the men were sufficiently expert to proceed with their practice alone or
in groups.  We hoped that every fighting-man in the country would in time
become an expert signaller.  Beyond these, again, we have always a few
priests.  The Church of the country is a militant Church; its priests are
soldiers, its Bishops commanders.  But they all serve wherever the battle
most needs them.  Naturally they, as men of brains, are quicker at
learning than the average mountaineers; with the result that they learnt
the code and the signalling almost by instinct.  We have now at least one
such expert in each community of them, and shortly the priests alone will
be able to signal, if need be, for the nation; thus releasing for active
service the merely fighting-man.  The men at present with me I took into
confidence as to the vessel's arrival, and we were all ready for work
when the man on the lookout at the Flagstaff sent word that a vessel
without lights was creeping in towards shore.  We all assembled on the
rocky edge of the creek, and saw her steal up the creek and gain the
shelter of the harbour.  When this had been effected, we ran out the boom
which protects the opening, and after that the great armoured
sliding-gates which Uncle Roger had himself had made so as to protect the
harbour in case of need.

We then came within and assisted in warping the steamer to the side of
the dock.

Rooke looked fit, and was full of fire and vigour.  His responsibility
and the mere thought of warlike action seemed to have renewed his youth.

When we had arranged for the unloading of the cases of arms and
ammunition, I took Rooke into the room which we call my "office," where
he gave me an account of his doings.  He had not only secured the rifles
and the ammunition for them, but he had purchased from one of the small
American Republics an armoured yacht which had been especially built for
war service.  He grew quite enthusiastic, even excited, as he told me of
her:

"She is the last word in naval construction--a torpedo yacht.  A small
cruiser, with turbines up to date, oil-fuelled, and fully armed with the
latest and most perfect weapons and explosives of all kinds.  The fastest
boat afloat to-day.  Built by Thorneycroft, engined by Parsons, armoured
by Armstrong, armed by Crupp.  If she ever comes into action, it will be
bad for her opponent, for she need not fear to tackle anything less than
a _Dreadnought_."

He also told me that from the same Government, whose nation had just
established an unlooked-for peace, he had also purchased a whole park of
artillery of the very latest patterns, and that for range and accuracy
the guns were held to be supreme.  These would follow before long, and
with them their proper ammunition, with a shipload of the same to follow
shortly after.

When he had told me all the rest of his news, and handed me the accounts,
we went out to the dock to see the debarkation of the war material.
Knowing that it was arriving, I had sent word in the afternoon to the
mountaineers to tell them to come and remove it.  They had answered the
call, and it really seemed to me that the whole of the land must that
night have been in motion.

They came as individuals, grouping themselves as they came within the
defences of the Castle; some had gathered at fixed points on the way.
They went secretly and in silence, stealing through the forests like
ghosts, each party when it grouped taking the place of that which had
gone on one of the routes radiating round Vissarion.  Their coming and
going was more than ghostly.  It was, indeed, the outward manifestation
of an inward spirit--a whole nation dominated by one common purpose.

The men in the steamer were nearly all engineers, mostly British, well
conducted, and to be depended upon.  Rooke had picked them separately,
and in the doing had used well his great experience of both men and
adventurous life.  These men were to form part of the armoured yacht's
crew when she should come into the Mediterranean waters.  They and the
priests and fighting-men in the Castle worked well together, and with a
zeal that was beyond praise.  The heavy cases seemed almost of their own
accord to leave the holds, so fast came the procession of them along the
gangways from deck to dock-wall.  It was a part of my design that the
arms should be placed in centres ready for local distribution.  In such a
country as this, without railways or even roads, the distribution of war
material in any quantity is a great labour, for it has to be done
individually, or at least from centres.

But of this work the great number of mountaineers who were arriving made
little account.  As fast as the ship's company, with the assistance of
the priests and fighting-men, placed the cases on the quay, the engineers
opened them and laid the contents ready for portage.  The mountaineers
seemed to come in a continuous stream; each in turn shouldered his burden
and passed out, the captain of his section giving him as he passed his
instruction where to go and in what route.  The method had been already
prepared in my office ready for such a distribution when the arms should
arrive, and descriptions and quantities had been noted by the captains.
The whole affair was treated by all as a matter of the utmost secrecy.
Hardly a word was spoken beyond the necessary directions, and these were
given in whispers.  All night long the stream of men went and came, and
towards dawn the bulk of the imported material was lessened by half.  On
the following night the remainder was removed, after my own men had
stored in the Castle the rifles and ammunition reserved for its defence
if necessary.  It was advisable to keep a reserve supply in case it
should ever be required.  The following night Rooke went away secretly in
the chartered vessel.  He had to bring back with him the purchased cannon
and heavy ammunition, which had been in the meantime stored on one of the
Greek islands.  The second morning, having had secret word that the
steamer was on the way, I had given the signal for the assembling of the
mountaineers.

A little after dark the vessel, showing no light, stole into the creek.
The barrier gates were once again closed, and when a sufficient number of
men had arrived to handle the guns, we began to unload.  The actual
deportation was easy enough, for the dock had all necessary appliances
quite up to date, including a pair of shears for gun-lifting which could
be raised into position in a very short time.

The guns were well furnished with tackle of all sorts, and before many
hours had passed a little procession of them disappeared into the woods
in ghostly silence.  A number of men surrounded each, and they moved as
well as if properly supplied with horses.

In the meantime, and for a week after the arrival of the guns, the
drilling went on without pause.  The gun-drill was wonderful.  In the
arduous work necessary for it the great strength and stamina of the
mountaineers showed out wonderfully.  They did not seem to know fatigue
any more than they knew fear.

For a week this went on, till a perfect discipline and management was
obtained.  They did not practise the shooting, for this would have made
secrecy impossible.  It was reported all along the Turkish frontier that
the Sultan's troops were being massed, and though this was not on a war
footing, the movement was more or less dangerous.  The reports of our own
spies, although vague as to the purpose and extent of the movement, were
definite as to something being on foot.  And Turkey does not do something
without a purpose that bodes ill to someone.  Certainly the sound of
cannon, which is a far-reaching sound, would have given them warning of
our preparations, and would so have sadly minimized their effectiveness.

When the cannon had all been disposed of--except, of course, those
destined for defence of the Castle or to be stored there--Rooke went away
with the ship and crew.  The ship he was to return to the owners; the men
would be shipped on the war-yacht, of whose crew they would form a part.
The rest of them had been carefully selected by Rooke himself, and were
kept in secrecy at Cattaro, ready for service the moment required.  They
were all good men, and quite capable of whatever work they might be set
to.  So Rooke told me, and he ought to know.  The experience of his young
days as a private made him an expert in such a job.



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                          _June_ 24, 1907.

Last night I got from my Lady a similar message to the last, and
delivered in a similar way.  This time, however, our meeting was to be on
the leads of the Keep.

I dressed myself very carefully before going on this adventure, lest by
any chance of household concern, any of the servants should see me; for
if this should happen, Aunt Janet would be sure to hear of it, which
would give rise to endless surmises and questionings--a thing I was far
from desiring.

I confess that in thinking the matter over during the time I was making
my hurried preparations I was at a loss to understand how any human body,
even though it be of the dead, could go or be conveyed to such a place
without some sort of assistance, or, at least, collusion, on the part of
some of the inmates.  At the visit to the Flagstaff circumstances were
different.  This spot was actually outside the Castle, and in order to
reach it I myself had to leave the Castle privately, and from the garden
ascend to the ramparts.  But here was no such possibility.  The Keep was
an _imperium in imperio_.  It stood within the Castle, though separated
from it, and it had its own defences against intrusion.  The roof of it
was, so far as I knew, as little approachable as the magazine.

The difficulty did not, however, trouble me beyond a mere passing
thought.  In the joy of the coming meeting and the longing rapture at the
mere thought of it, all difficulties disappeared.  Love makes its own
faith, and I never doubted that my Lady would be waiting for me at the
place designated.  When I had passed through the little arched passages,
and up the doubly-grated stairways contrived in the massiveness of the
walls, I let myself out on the leads.  It was well that as yet the times
were sufficiently peaceful not to necessitate guards or sentries at all
such points.

There, in a dim corner where the moonlight and the passing clouds threw
deep shadows, I saw her, clothed as ever in her shroud.  Why, I know not.
I felt somehow that the situation was even more serious than ever.  But I
was steeled to whatever might come.  My mind had been already made up.
To carry out my resolve to win the woman I loved I was ready to face
death.  But now, after we had for a few brief moments held each other in
our arms, I was willing to accept death--or more than death.  Now, more
than before, was she sweet and dear to me.  Whatever qualms there might
have been at the beginning of our love-making, or during the progress of
it, did not now exist.  We had exchanged vows and confidences, and
acknowledged our loves.  What, then, could there be of distrust, or even
doubt, that the present might not set at naught?  But even had there been
such doubts or qualms, they must have disappeared in the ardour of our
mutual embrace.  I was by now mad for her, and was content to be so mad.
When she had breath to speak after the strictness of our embrace, she
said:

"I have come to warn you to be more than ever careful."  It was, I
confess, a pang to me, who thought only of love, to hear that anything
else should have been the initiative power of her coming, even though it
had been her concern for my own safety.  I could not but notice the
bitter note of chagrin in my voice as I answered:

"It was for love's sake that _I_ came."  She, too, evidently felt the
undercurrent of pain, for she said quickly:

"Ah, dearest, I, too, came for love's sake.  It is because I love you
that I am so anxious about you.  What would the world--ay, or heaven--be
to me without you?"

There was such earnest truth in her tone that the sense and realization
of my own harshness smote me.  In the presence of such love as this even
a lover's selfishness must become abashed.  I could not express myself in
words, so simply raised her slim hand in mine and kissed it.  As it lay
warm in my own I could not but notice, as well as its fineness, its
strength and the firmness of its clasp.  Its warmth and fervour struck
into my heart--and my brain.  Thereupon I poured out to her once more my
love for her, she listening all afire.  When passion had had its say, the
calmer emotions had opportunity of expression.  When I was satisfied
afresh of her affection, I began to value her care for my safety, and so
I went back to the subject.  Her very insistence, based on personal
affection, gave me more solid ground for fear.  In the moment of love
transports I had forgotten, or did not think, of what wonderful power or
knowledge she must have to be able to move in such strange ways as she
did.  Why, at this very moment she was within my own gates.  Locks and
bars, even the very seal of death itself, seemed unable to make for her a
prison-house.  With such freedom of action and movement, going when she
would into secret places, what might she not know that was known to
others?  How could anyone keep secret from such an one even an ill
intent?  Such thoughts, such surmises, had often flashed through my mind
in moments of excitement rather than of reflection, but never long enough
to become fixed into belief.  But yet the consequences, the convictions,
of them were with me, though unconsciously, though the thoughts
themselves were perhaps forgotten or withered before development.

"And you?" I asked her earnestly.  "What about danger to you?"  She
smiled, her little pearl-white teeth gleaming in the moonlight, as she
spoke:

"There is no danger for me.  I am safe.  I am the safest person, perhaps
the only safe person, in all this land."  The full significance of her
words did not seem to come to me all at once.  Some base for
understanding such an assertion seemed to be wanting.  It was not that I
did not trust or believe her, but that I thought she might be mistaken.
I wanted to reassure myself, so in my distress I asked unthinkingly:

"How the safest?  What is your protection?"  For several moments that
spun themselves out endlessly she looked me straight in the face, the
stars in her eyes seeming to glow like fire; then, lowering her head, she
took a fold of her shroud and held it up to me.

"This!"

The meaning was complete and understandable now.  I could not speak at
once for the wave of emotion which choked me.  I dropped on my knees, and
taking her in my arms, held her close to me.  She saw that I was moved,
and tenderly stroked my hair, and with delicate touch pressed down my
head on her bosom, as a mother might have done to comfort a frightened
child.

Presently we got back to the realities of life again.  I murmured:

"Your safety, your life, your happiness are all-in-all to me.  When will
you let them be my care?"  She trembled in my arms, nestling even closer
to me.  Her own arms seemed to quiver with delight as she said:

"Would you indeed like me to be always with you?  To me it would be a
happiness unspeakable; and to you, what would it be?"

I thought that she wished to hear me speak my love to her, and that,
woman-like, she had led me to the utterance, and so I spoke again of the
passion that now raged in me, she listening eagerly as we strained each
other tight in our arms.  At last there came a pause, a long, long pause,
and our hearts beat consciously in unison as we stood together.
Presently she said in a sweet, low, intense whisper, as soft as the
sighing of summer wind:

"It shall be as you wish; but oh, my dear, you will have to first go
through an ordeal which may try you terribly!  Do not ask me anything!
You must not ask, because I may not answer, and it would be pain to me to
deny you anything.  Marriage with such an one as I am has its own ritual,
which may not be foregone.  It may . . . "  I broke passionately into her
speaking:

"There is no ritual that I fear, so long as it be that it is for your
good, and your lasting happiness.  And if the end of it be that I may
call you mine, there is no horror in life or death that I shall not
gladly face.  Dear, I ask you nothing.  I am content to leave myself in
your hands.  You shall advise me when the time comes, and I shall be
satisfied, content to obey.  Content!  It is but a poor word to express
what I long for!  I shall shirk nothing which may come to me from this or
any other world, so long as it is to make you mine!"  Once again her
murmured happiness was music to my ears:

"Oh, how you love me! how you love me, dear, dear!"  She took me in her
arms, and for a few seconds we hung together.  Suddenly she tore herself
apart from me, and stood drawn up to the full height, with a dignity I
cannot describe or express.  Her voice had a new dominance, as with firm
utterance and in staccato manner she said:

"Rupert Sent Leger, before we go a step further I must say something to
you, ask you something, and I charge you, on your most sacred honour and
belief, to answer me truly.  Do you believe me to be one of those unhappy
beings who may not die, but have to live in shameful existence between
earth and the nether world, and whose hellish mission is to destroy, body
and soul, those who love them till they fall to their level?  You are a
gentleman, and a brave one.  I have found you fearless.  Answer me in
sternest truth, no matter what the issue may be!"

She stood there in the glamorous moonlight with a commanding dignity
which seemed more than human.  In that mystic light her white shroud
seemed diaphanous, and she appeared like a spirit of power.  What was I
to say?  How could I admit to such a being that I had actually had at
moments, if not a belief, a passing doubt?  It was a conviction with me
that if I spoke wrongly I should lose her for ever.  I was in a desperate
strait.  In such a case there is but one solid ground which one may rest
on--the Truth.

I really felt I was between the devil and the deep sea.  There was no
avoiding the issue, and so, out of this all-embracing, all-compelling
conviction of truth, I spoke.

For a fleeting moment I felt that my tone was truculent, and almost
hesitated; but as I saw no anger or indignation on my Lady's face, but
rather an eager approval, I was reassured.  A woman, after all, is glad
to see a man strong, for all belief in him must be based on that.

"I shall speak the truth.  Remember that I have no wish to hurt your
feelings, but as you conjure me by my honour, you must forgive me if I
pain.  It is true that I had at first--ay, and later, when I came to
think matters over after you had gone, when reason came to the aid of
impression--a passing belief that you are a Vampire.  How can I fail to
have, even now, though I love you with all my soul, though I have held
you in my arms and kissed you on the mouth, a doubt, when all the
evidences seem to point to one thing?  Remember that I have only seen you
at night, except that bitter moment when, in the broad noonday of the
upper world, I saw you, clad as ever in a shroud, lying seemingly dead in
a tomb in the crypt of St. Sava's Church . . . But let that pass.  Such
belief as I have is all in you.  Be you woman or Vampire, it is all the
same to me.  It is _you_ whom I love!  Should it be that you are--you are
not woman, which I cannot believe, then it will be my glory to break your
fetters, to open your prison, and set you free.  To that I consecrate my
life."  For a few seconds I stood silent, vibrating with the passion
which had been awakened in me.  She had by now lost the measure of her
haughty isolation, and had softened into womanhood again.  It was really
like a realization of the old theme of Pygmalion's statue.  It was with
rather a pleading than a commanding voice that she said:

"And shall you always be true to me?"

"Always--so help me, God!" I answered, and I felt that there could be no
lack of conviction in my voice.

Indeed, there was no cause for such lack.  She also stood for a little
while stone-still, and I was beginning to expand to the rapture which was
in store for me when she should take me again in her arms.

But there was no such moment of softness.  All at once she started as if
she had suddenly wakened from a dream, and on the spur of the moment
said:

"Now go, go!"  I felt the conviction of necessity to obey, and turned at
once.  As I moved towards the door by which I had entered, I asked:

"When shall I see you again?"

"Soon!" came her answer.  "I shall let you know soon--when and where.
Oh, go, go!"  She almost pushed me from her.

When I had passed through the low doorway and locked and barred it behind
me, I felt a pang that I should have had to shut her out like that; but I
feared lest there should arise some embarrassing suspicion if the door
should be found open.  Later came the comforting thought that, as she had
got to the roof though the door had been shut, she would be able to get
away by the same means.  She had evidently knowledge of some secret way
into the Castle.  The alternative was that she must have some
supernatural quality or faculty which gave her strange powers.  I did not
wish to pursue that train of thought, and so, after an effort, shut it
out from my mind.

When I got back to my room I locked the door behind me, and went to sleep
in the dark.  I did not want light just then--could not bear it.

This morning I woke, a little later than usual, with a kind of
apprehension which I could not at once understand.  Presently, however,
when my faculties became fully awake and in working order, I realized
that I feared, half expected, that Aunt Janet would come to me in a worse
state of alarm than ever apropos of some new Second-Sight experience of
more than usual ferocity.

But, strange to say, I had no such visit.  Later on in the morning, when,
after breakfast, we walked together through the garden, I asked her how
she had slept, and if she had dreamt.  She answered me that she had slept
without waking, and if she had had any dreams, they must have been
pleasant ones, for she did not remember them.  "And you know, Rupert,"
she added, "that if there be anything bad or fearsome or warning in
dreams, I always remember them."

Later still, when I was by myself on the cliff beyond the creek, I could
not help commenting on the absence of her power of Second Sight on the
occasion.  Surely, if ever there was a time when she might have had cause
of apprehension, it might well have been when I asked the Lady whom she
did not know to marry me--the Lady of whose identity I knew nothing, even
whose name I did not know--whom I loved with all my heart and soul--my
Lady of the Shroud.

I have lost faith in Second Sight.

                                                           _July_ 1, 1907.

Another week gone.  I have waited patiently, and I am at last rewarded by
another letter.  I was preparing for bed a little while ago, when I heard
the same mysterious sound at the door as on the last two occasions.  I
hurried to the glass door, and there found another close-folded letter.
But I could see no sign of my Lady, or of any other living being.  The
letter, which was without direction, ran as follows:

"If you are still of the same mind, and feel no misgivings, meet me at
the Church of St. Sava beyond the Creek to-morrow night at a quarter
before midnight.  If you come, come in secret, and, of course, alone.  Do
not come at all unless you are prepared for a terrible ordeal.  But if
you love me, and have neither doubts nor fears, come.  Come!"

Needless to say, I did not sleep last night.  I tried to, but without
success.  It was no morbid happiness that kept me awake, no doubting, no
fear.  I was simply overwhelmed with the idea of the coming rapture when
I should call my Lady my very, very own.  In this sea of happy
expectation all lesser things were submerged.  Even sleep, which is an
imperative force with me, failed in its usual effectiveness, and I lay
still, calm, content.

With the coming of the morning, however, restlessness began.  I did not
know what to do, how to restrain myself, where to look for an anodyne.
Happily the latter came in the shape of Rooke, who turned up shortly
after breakfast.  He had a satisfactory tale to tell me of the armoured
yacht, which had lain off Cattaro on the previous night, and to which he
had brought his contingent of crew which had waited for her coming.  He
did not like to take the risk of going into any port with such a vessel,
lest he might be detained or otherwise hampered by forms, and had gone
out upon the open sea before daylight.  There was on board the yacht a
tiny torpedo-boat, for which provision was made both for hoisting on deck
and housing there.  This last would run into the creek at ten o'clock
that evening, at which time it would be dark.  The yacht would then run
to near Otranto, to which she would send a boat to get any message I
might send.  This was to be in a code, which we arranged, and would
convey instructions as to what night and approximate hour the yacht would
come to the creek.

The day was well on before we had made certain arrangements for the
future; and not till then did I feel again the pressure of my personal
restlessness.  Rooke, like a wise commander, took rest whilst he could.
Well he knew that for a couple of days and nights at least there would be
little, if any, sleep for him.

For myself, the habit of self-control stood to me, and I managed to get
through the day somehow without exciting the attention of anyone else.
The arrival of the torpedo-boat and the departure of Rooke made for me a
welcome break in my uneasiness.  An hour ago I said good-night to Aunt
Janet, and shut myself up alone here.  My watch is on the table before
me, so that I may make sure of starting to the moment.  I have allowed
myself half an hour to reach St. Sava.  My skiff is waiting, moored at
the foot of the cliff on the hither side, where the zigzag comes close to
the water.  It is now ten minutes past eleven.

I shall add the odd five minutes to the time for my journey so as to make
safe.  I go unarmed and without a light.

I shall show no distrust of anyone or anything this night.

                                                           _July_ 2, 1907.

When I was outside the church, I looked at my watch in the bright
moonlight, and found I had one minute to wait.  So I stood in the shadow
of the doorway and looked out at the scene before me.  Not a sign of life
was visible around me, either on land or sea.  On the broad plateau on
which the church stands there was no movement of any kind.  The wind,
which had been pleasant in the noontide, had fallen completely, and not a
leaf was stirring.  I could see across the creek and note the hard line
where the battlements of the Castle cut the sky, and where the keep
towered above the line of black rock, which in the shadow of the land
made an ebon frame for the picture.  When I had seen the same view on
former occasions, the line where the rock rose from the sea was a fringe
of white foam.  But then, in the daylight, the sea was sapphire blue; now
it was an expanse of dark blue--so dark as to seem almost black.  It had
not even the relief of waves or ripples--simply a dark, cold, lifeless
expanse, with no gleam of light anywhere, of lighthouse or ship; neither
was there any special sound to be heard that one could
distinguish--nothing but the distant hum of the myriad voices of the dark
mingling in one ceaseless inarticulate sound.  It was well I had not time
to dwell on it, or I might have reached some spiritually-disturbing
melancholy.

Let me say here that ever since I had received my Lady's message
concerning this visit to St. Sava's I had been all on fire--not, perhaps,
at every moment consciously or actually so, but always, as it were,
prepared to break out into flame.  Did I want a simile, I might compare
myself to a well-banked furnace, whose present function it is to contain
heat rather than to create it; whose crust can at any moment be broken by
a force external to itself, and burst into raging, all-compelling heat.
No thought of fear really entered my mind.  Every other emotion there
was, coming and going as occasion excited or lulled, but not fear.  Well
I knew in the depths of my heart the purpose which that secret quest was
to serve.  I knew not only from my Lady's words, but from the teachings
of my own senses and experiences, that some dreadful ordeal must take
place before happiness of any kind could be won.  And that ordeal, though
method or detail was unknown to me, I was prepared to undertake.  This
was one of those occasions when a man must undertake, blindfold, ways
that may lead to torture or death, or unknown terrors beyond.  But, then,
a man--if, indeed, he have the heart of a man--can always undertake; he
can at least make the first step, though it may turn out that through the
weakness of mortality he may be unable to fulfil his own intent, or
justify his belief in his own powers.  Such, I take it, was the
intellectual attitude of the brave souls who of old faced the tortures of
the Inquisition.

But though there was no immediate fear, there was a certain doubt.  For
doubt is one of those mental conditions whose calling we cannot control.
The end of the doubting may not be a reality to us, or be accepted as a
possibility.  These things cannot forego the existence of the doubt.
"For even if a man," says Victor Cousin, "doubt everything else, at least
he cannot doubt that he doubts."  The doubt had at times been on me that
my Lady of the Shroud was a Vampire.  Much that had happened seemed to
point that way, and here, on the very threshold of the Unknown, when,
through the door which I was pushing open, my eyes met only an expanse of
absolute blackness, all doubts which had ever been seemed to surround me
in a legion.  I have heard that, when a man is drowning, there comes a
time when his whole life passes in review during the space of time which
cannot be computed as even a part of a second.  So it was to me in the
moment of my body passing into the church.  In that moment came to my
mind all that had been, which bore on the knowledge of my Lady; and the
general tendency was to prove or convince that she was indeed a Vampire.
Much that had happened, or become known to me, seemed to justify the
resolving of doubt into belief.  Even my own reading of the books in Aunt
Janet's little library, and the dear lady's comments on them, mingled
with her own uncanny beliefs, left little opening for doubt.  My having
to help my Lady over the threshold of my house on her first entry was in
accord with Vampire tradition; so, too, her flying at cock-crow from the
warmth in which she revelled on that strange first night of our meeting;
so, too, her swift departure at midnight on the second.  Into the same
category came the facts of her constant wearing of her Shroud, even her
pledging herself, and me also, on the fragment torn from it, which she
had given to me as a souvenir; her lying still in the glass-covered tomb;
her coming alone to the most secret places in a fortified Castle where
every aperture was secured by unopened locks and bolts; her very
movements, though all of grace, as she flitted noiselessly through the
gloom of night.

All these things, and a thousand others of lesser import, seemed, for the
moment, to have consolidated an initial belief.  But then came the
supreme recollections of how she had lain in my arms; of her kisses on my
lips; of the beating of her heart against my own; of her sweet words of
belief and faith breathed in my ear in intoxicating whispers; of . . . I
paused.  No!  I could not accept belief as to her being other than a
living woman of soul and sense, of flesh and blood, of all the sweet and
passionate instincts of true and perfect womanhood.

And so, in spite of all--in spite of all beliefs, fixed or transitory,
with a mind whirling amid contesting forces and compelling beliefs--I
stepped into the church overwhelmed with that most receptive of
atmospheres--doubt.

In one thing only was I fixed: here at least was no doubt or misgiving
whatever.  I intended to go through what I had undertaken.  Moreover, I
felt that I was strong enough to carry out my intention, whatever might
be of the Unknown--however horrible, however terrible.

When I had entered the church and closed the heavy door behind me, the
sense of darkness and loneliness in all their horror enfolded me round.
The great church seemed a living mystery, and served as an almost
terrible background to thoughts and remembrances of unutterable gloom.
My adventurous life has had its own schooling to endurance and upholding
one's courage in trying times; but it has its contra in fulness of
memory.

I felt my way forward with both hands and feet.  Every second seemed as
if it had brought me at last to a darkness which was actually tangible.
All at once, and with no heed of sequence or order, I was conscious of
all around me, the knowledge or perception of which--or even speculation
on the subject--had never entered my mind.  They furnished the darkness
with which I was encompassed with all the crowded phases of a dream.  I
knew that all around me were memorials of the dead--that in the Crypt
deep-wrought in the rock below my feet lay the dead themselves.  Some of
them, perhaps--one of them I knew--had even passed the grim portals of
time Unknown, and had, by some mysterious power or agency, come back
again to material earth.  There was no resting-place for thought when I
knew that the very air which I breathed might be full of denizens of the
spirit-world.  In that impenetrable blackness was a world of imagining
whose possibilities of horror were endless.

I almost fancied that I could see with mortal eyes down through that
rocky floor to where, in the lonely Crypt, lay, in her tomb of massive
stone and under that bewildering coverlet of glass, the woman whom I
love.  I could see her beautiful face, her long black lashes, her sweet
mouth--which I had kissed--relaxed in the sleep of death.  I could note
the voluminous shroud--a piece of which as a precious souvenir lay even
then so close to my heart--the snowy woollen coverlet wrought over in
gold with sprigs of pine, the soft dent in the cushion on which her head
must for so long have lain.  I could see myself--within my eyes the
memory of that first visit--coming once again with glad step to renew
that dear sight--dear, though it scorched my eyes and harrowed my
heart--and finding the greater sorrow, the greater desolation of the
empty tomb!

There!  I felt that I must think no more of that lest the thought should
unnerve me when I should most want all my courage.  That way madness lay!
The darkness had already sufficient terrors of its own without bringing
to it such grim remembrances and imaginings . . . And I had yet to go
through some ordeal which, even to her who had passed and repassed the
portals of death, was full of fear.

It was a merciful relief to me when, in groping my way forwards through
the darkness, I struck against some portion of the furnishing of the
church.  Fortunately I was all strung up to tension, else I should never
have been able to control instinctively, as I did, the shriek which was
rising to my lips.

I would have given anything to have been able to light even a match.  A
single second of light would, I felt, have made me my own man again.  But
I knew that this would be against the implied condition of my being there
at all, and might have had disastrous consequences to her whom I had come
to save.  It might even frustrate my scheme, and altogether destroy my
opportunity.  At that moment it was borne upon me more strongly than ever
that this was not a mere fight for myself or my own selfish purposes--not
merely an adventure or a struggle for only life and death against unknown
difficulties and dangers.  It was a fight on behalf of her I loved, not
merely for her life, but perhaps even for her soul.

And yet this very thinking--understanding--created a new form of terror.
For in that grim, shrouding darkness came memories of other moments of
terrible stress.

Of wild, mystic rites held in the deep gloom of African forests, when,
amid scenes of revolting horror, Obi and the devils of his kind seemed to
reveal themselves to reckless worshippers, surfeited with horror, whose
lives counted for naught; when even human sacrifice was an episode, and
the reek of old deviltries and recent carnage tainted the air, till even
I, who was, at the risk of my life, a privileged spectator who had come
through dangers without end to behold the scene, rose and fled in horror.

Of scenes of mystery enacted in rock-cut temples beyond the Himalayas,
whose fanatic priests, cold as death and as remorseless, in the reaction
of their phrenzy of passion, foamed at the mouth and then sank into
marble quiet, as with inner eyes they beheld the visions of the hellish
powers which they had invoked.

Of wild, fantastic dances of the Devil-worshippers of Madagascar, where
even the very semblance of humanity disappeared in the fantastic excesses
of their orgies.

Of strange doings of gloom and mystery in the rock-perched monasteries of
Thibet.

Of awful sacrifices, all to mystic ends, in the innermost recesses of
Cathay.

Of weird movements with masses of poisonous snakes by the medicine-men of
the Zuni and Mochi Indians in the far south-west of the Rockies, beyond
the great plains.

Of secret gatherings in vast temples of old Mexico, and by dim altars of
forgotten cities in the heart of great forests in South America.

Of rites of inconceivable horror in the fastnesses of Patagonia.

Of . . . Here I once more pulled myself up.  Such thoughts were no kind
of proper preparation for what I might have to endure.  My work that
night was to be based on love, on hope, on self-sacrifice for the woman
who in all the world was the closest to my heart, whose future I was to
share, whether that sharing might lead me to Hell or Heaven.  The hand
which undertook such a task must have no trembling.

Still, those horrible memories had, I am bound to say, a useful part in
my preparation for the ordeal.  They were of fact which I had seen, of
which I had myself been in part a sharer, and which I had survived.  With
such experiences behind me, could there be aught before me more dreadful?
. . .

Moreover, if the coming ordeal was of supernatural or superhuman order,
could it transcend in living horror the vilest and most desperate acts of
the basest men? . . .

With renewed courage I felt my way before me, till my sense of touch told
me that I was at the screen behind which lay the stair to the Crypt.

There I waited, silent, still.

My own part was done, so far as I knew how to do it.  Beyond this, what
was to come was, so far as I knew, beyond my own control.  I had done
what I could; the rest must come from others.  I had exactly obeyed my
instructions, fulfilled my warranty to the utmost in my knowledge and
power.  There was, therefore, left for me in the present nothing but to
wait.

It is a peculiarity of absolute darkness that it creates its own
reaction.  The eye, wearied of the blackness, begins to imagine forms of
light.  How far this is effected by imagination pure and simple I know
not.  It may be that nerves have their own senses that bring thought to
the depository common to all the human functions, but, whatever may be
the mechanism or the objective, the darkness seems to people itself with
luminous entities.

So was it with me as I stood lonely in the dark, silent church.  Here and
there seemed to flash tiny points of light.

In the same way the silence began to be broken now and again by strange
muffled sounds--the suggestion of sounds rather than actual vibrations.
These were all at first of the minor importance of movement--rustlings,
creakings, faint stirrings, fainter breathings.  Presently, when I had
somewhat recovered from the sort of hypnotic trance to which the darkness
and stillness had during the time of waiting reduced me, I looked around
in wonder.

The phantoms of light and sound seemed to have become real.  There were
most certainly actual little points of light in places--not enough to see
details by, but quite sufficient to relieve the utter gloom.  I
thought--though it may have been a mingling of recollection and
imagination--that I could distinguish the outlines of the church;
certainly the great altar-screen was dimly visible.  Instinctively I
looked up--and thrilled.  There, hung high above me, was, surely enough,
a great Greek Cross, outlined by tiny points of light.

I lost myself in wonder, and stood still, in a purely receptive mood,
unantagonistic to aught, willing for whatever might come, ready for all
things, in rather a negative than a positive mood--a mood which has an
aspect of spiritual meekness.  This is the true spirit of the neophyte,
and, though I did not think of it at the time, the proper attitude for
what is called by the Church in whose temple I stood a "neo-nymph."

As the light grew a little in power, though never increasing enough for
distinctness, I saw dimly before me a table on which rested a great open
book, whereon were laid two rings--one of sliver, the other of gold--and
two crowns wrought of flowers, bound at the joining of their stems with
tissue--one of gold, the other of silver.  I do not know much of the
ritual of the old Greek Church, which is the religion of the Blue
Mountains, but the things which I saw before me could be none other than
enlightening symbols.  Instinctively I knew that I had been brought
hither, though in this grim way, to be married.  The very idea of it
thrilled me to the heart's core.  I thought the best thing I could do
would be to stay quite still, and not show surprise at anything that
might happen; but be sure I was all eyes and ears.

I peered anxiously around me in every direction, but I could see no sign
of her whom I had come to meet.

Incidentally, however, I noticed that in the lighting, such as it was,
there was no flame, no "living" light.  Whatever light there was came
muffled, as though through some green translucent stone.  The whole
effect was terribly weird and disconcerting.

Presently I started, as, seemingly out of the darkness beside me, a man's
hand stretched out and took mine.  Turning, I found close to me a tall
man with shining black eyes and long black hair and beard.  He was clad
in some kind of gorgeous robe of cloth of gold, rich with variety of
adornment.  His head was covered with a high, over-hanging hat draped
closely with a black scarf, the ends of which formed a long, hanging veil
on either side.  These veils, falling over the magnificent robes of cloth
of gold, had an extraordinarily solemn effect.

I yielded myself to the guiding hand, and shortly found myself, so far as
I could see, at one side of the sanctuary.

In the floor close to my feet was a yawning chasm, into which, from so
high over my head that in the uncertain light I could not distinguish its
origin, hung a chain.  At the sight a strange wave of memory swept over
me.  I could not but remember the chain which hung over the glass-covered
tomb in the Crypt, and I had an instinctive feeling that the grim chasm
in the floor of the sanctuary was but the other side of the opening in
the roof of the crypt from which the chain over the sarcophagus depended.

There was a creaking sound--the groaning of a windlass and the clanking
of a chain.  There was heavy breathing close to me somewhere.  I was so
intent on what was going on that I did not see that one by one, seeming
to grow out of the surrounding darkness, several black figures in monkish
garb appeared with the silence of ghosts.  Their faces were shrouded in
black cowls, wherein were holes through which I could see dark gleaming
eyes.  My guide held me tightly by the hand.  This gave me a feeling of
security in the touch which helped to retain within my breast some
semblance of calm.

The strain of the creaking windlass and the clanking chain continued for
so long that the suspense became almost unendurable.  At last there came
into sight an iron ring, from which as a centre depended four lesser
chains spreading wide.  In a few seconds more I could see that these were
fixed to the corners of the great stone tomb with the covering of glass,
which was being dragged upward.  As it arose it filled closely the whole
aperture.  When its bottom had reached the level of the floor it stopped,
and remained rigid.  There was no room for oscillation.  It was at once
surrounded by a number of black figures, who raised the glass covering
and bore it away into the darkness.  Then there stepped forward a very
tall man, black-bearded, and with head-gear like my guide, but made in
triple tiers, he also was gorgeously arrayed in flowing robes of cloth of
gold richly embroidered.  He raised his hand, and forthwith eight other
black-clad figures stepped forward, and bending over the stone coffin,
raised from it the rigid form of my Lady, still clad in her Shroud, and
laid it gently on the floor of the sanctuary.

I felt it a grace that at that instant the dim lights seemed to grow
less, and finally to disappear--all save the tiny points that marked the
outline of the great Cross high overhead.  These only gave light enough
to accentuate the gloom.  The hand that held mine now released it, and
with a sigh I realized that I was alone.  After a few moments more of the
groaning of the winch and clanking of the chain there was a sharp sound
of stone meeting stone; then there was silence.  I listened acutely, but
could not hear near me the slightest sound.  Even the cautious,
restrained breathing around me, of which up to then I had been conscious,
had ceased.  Not knowing, in the helplessness of my ignorance, what I
should do, I remained as I was, still and silent, for a time that seemed
endless.  At last, overcome by some emotion which I could not at the
moment understand, I slowly sank to my knees and bowed my head.  Covering
my face with my hands, I tried to recall the prayers of my youth.  It was
not, I am certain, that fear in any form had come upon me, or that I
hesitated or faltered in my intention.  That much I know now; I knew it
even then.  It was, I believe, that the prolonged impressive gloom and
mystery had at last touched me to the quick.  The bending of the knees
was but symbolical of the bowing of the spirit to a higher Power.  When I
had realized that much, I felt more content than I had done since I had
entered the church, and with the renewed consciousness of courage, took
my hands from my face, and lifted again my bowed head.

Impulsively I sprang to my feet and stood erect--waiting.  All seemed to
have changed since I had dropped on my knees.  The points of light about
time church, which had been eclipsed, had come again, and were growing in
power to a partial revealing of the dim expanse.  Before me was the table
with the open book, on which were laid the gold and silver rings and the
two crowns of flowers.  There were also two tall candles, with tiniest
flames of blue--the only living light to be seen.

Out of the darkness stepped the same tall figure in the gorgeous robes
and the triple hat.  He led by the hand my Lady, still clad in her
Shroud; but over it, descending from the crown of her head, was a veil of
very old and magnificent lace of astonishing fineness.  Even in that dim
light I could note the exquisite beauty of the fabric.  The veil was
fastened with a bunch of tiny sprays of orange-blossom mingled with
cypress and laurel--a strange combination.  In her hand she carried a
great bouquet of the same.  Its sweet intoxicating odour floated up to my
nostrils.  It and the sentiment which its very presence evoked made me
quiver.

Yielding to the guiding of the hand which held hers, she stood at my left
side before the table.  Her guide then took his place behind her.  At
either end of the table, to right and left of us, stood a long-bearded
priest in splendid robes, and wearing the hat with depending veil of
black.  One of them, who seemed to be the more important of the two, and
took the initiative, signed to us to put our right hands on the open
book.  My Lady, of course, understood the ritual, and knew the words
which the priest was speaking, and of her own accord put out her hand.
My guide at the same moment directed my hand to the same end.  It
thrilled me to touch my Lady's hand, even under such mysterious
conditions.

After the priest had signed us each thrice on the forehead with the sign
of the Cross, he gave to each of us a tiny lighted taper brought to him
for the purpose.  The lights were welcome, not so much for the solace of
the added light, great as that was, but because it allowed us to see a
little more of each other's faces.  It was rapture to me to see the face
of my Bride; and from the expression of her face I was assured that she
felt as I did.  It gave me an inexpressible pleasure when, as her eyes
rested on me, there grew a faint blush over the grey pallor of her
cheeks.

The priest then put in solemn voice to each of us in turn, beginning with
me, the questions of consent which are common to all such rituals.  I
answered as well as I could, following the murmured words of my guide.
My Lady answered out proudly in a voice which, though given softly,
seemed to ring.  It was a concern--even a grief--to me that I could not,
in the priest's questioning, catch her name, of which, strangely
enough,--I was ignorant.  But, as I did not know the language, and as the
phrases were not in accord literally with our own ritual, I could not
make out which word was the name.

After some prayers and blessings, rhythmically spoken or sung by an
invisible choir, the priest took the rings from the open book, and, after
signing my forehead thrice with the gold one as he repeated the blessing
in each case, placed it on my right hand; then he gave my Lady the silver
one, with the same ritual thrice repeated.  I suppose it was the blessing
which is the effective point in making two into one.

After this, those who stood behind us exchanged our rings thrice, taking
them from one finger and placing them on the other, so that at the end my
wife wore the gold ring and I the silver one.

Then came a chant, during which the priest swung the censer himself, and
my wife and I held our tapers.  After that he blessed us, the responses
coming from the voices of the unseen singers in the darkness.

After a long ritual of prayer and blessing, sung in triplicate, the
priest took the crowns of flowers, and put one on the head of each,
crowning me first, and with the crown tied with gold.  Then he signed and
blessed us each thrice.  The guides, who stood behind us, exchanged our
crowns thrice, as they had exchanged the rings; so that at the last, as I
was glad to see, my wife wore the crown of gold, and I that of silver.

Then there came, if it is possible to describe such a thing, a hush over
even that stillness, as though some form of added solemnity were to be
gone through.  I was not surprised, therefore, when the priest took in
his hands the great golden chalice.  Kneeling, my wife and I partook
together thrice.

When we had risen from our knees and stood for a little while, the priest
took my left hand in his right, and I, by direction of my guide, gave my
right hand to my wife.  And so in a line, the priest leading, we circled
round the table in rhythmic measure.  Those who supported us moved behind
us, holding the crowns over our heads, and replacing them when we
stopped.

After a hymn, sung through the darkness, the priest took off our crowns.
This was evidently the conclusion of the ritual, for the priest placed us
in each other's arms to embrace each other.  Then he blessed us, who were
now man and wife!

The lights went out at once, some as if extinguished, others slowly
fading down to blackness.

Left in the dark, my wife and I sought each other's arms again, and stood
together for a few moments heart to heart, tightly clasping each other,
and kissed each other fervently.

Instinctively we turned to the door of the church, which was slightly
open, so that we could see the moonlight stealing in through the
aperture.  With even steps, she holding me tightly by the left arm--which
is the wife's arm, we passed through the old church and out into the free
air.

Despite all that the gloom had brought me, it was sweet to be in the open
air and together--this quite apart from our new relations to each other.
The moon rode high, and the full light, coming after the dimness or
darkness in the church, seemed as bright as day.  I could now, for the
first time, see my wife's face properly.  The glamour of the moonlight
may have served to enhance its ethereal beauty, but neither moonlight nor
sunlight could do justice to that beauty in its living human splendour.
As I gloried in her starry eyes I could think of nothing else; but when
for a moment my eyes, roving round for the purpose of protection, caught
sight of her whole figure, there was a pang to my heart.  The brilliant
moonlight showed every detail in terrible effect, and I could see that
she wore only her Shroud.  In the moment of darkness, after the last
benediction, before she returned to my arms, she must have removed her
bridal veil.  This may, of course, have been in accordance with the
established ritual of her church; but, all the same, my heart was sore.
The glamour of calling her my very own was somewhat obscured by the
bridal adornment being shorn.  But it made no difference in her sweetness
to me.  Together we went along the path through the wood, she keeping
equal step with me in wifely way.

When we had come through the trees near enough to see the roof of the
Castle, now gilded with the moonlight, she stopped, and looking at me
with eyes full of love, said:

"Here I must leave you!"

"What?"  I was all aghast, and I felt that my chagrin was expressed in
the tone of horrified surprise in my voice.  She went on quickly:

"Alas!  It is impossible that I should go farther--at present!"

"But what is to prevent you?" I queried.  "You are now my wife.  This is
our wedding-night; and surely your place is with me!"  The wail in her
voice as she answered touched me to the quick:

"Oh, I know, I know!  There is no dearer wish in my heart--there can be
none--than to share my husband's home.  Oh, my dear, my dear, if you only
knew what it would be to me to be with you always!  But indeed I may
not--not yet!  I am not free!  If you but knew how much that which has
happened to-night has cost me--or how much cost to others as well as to
myself may be yet to come--you would understand.  Rupert"--it was the
first time she had ever addressed me by name, and naturally it thrilled
me through and through--"Rupert, my husband, only that I trust you with
all the faith which is in perfect love--mutual love, I dare not have done
what I have done this night.  But, dear, I know that you will bear me
out; that your wife's honour is your honour, even as your honour is mine.
My honour is given to this; and you can help me--the only help I can have
at present--by trusting me.  Be patient, my beloved, be patient!  Oh, be
patient for a little longer!  It shall not be for long.  So soon as ever
my soul is freed I shall come to you, my husband; and we shall never part
again.  Be content for a while!  Believe me that I love you with my very
soul; and to keep away from your dear side is more bitter for me than
even it can be for you!  Think, my dear one, I am not as other women are,
as some day you shall clearly understand.  I am at the present, and shall
be for a little longer, constrained by duties and obligations put upon me
by others, and for others, and to which I am pledged by the most sacred
promises--given not only by myself, but by others--and which I must not
forgo.  These forbid me to do as I wish.  Oh, trust me, my beloved--my
husband!"

She held out her hands appealingly.  The moonlight, falling through the
thinning forest, showed her white cerements.  Then the recollection of
all she must have suffered--the awful loneliness in that grim tomb in the
Crypt, the despairing agony of one who is helpless against the
unknown--swept over me in a wave of pity.  What could I do but save her
from further pain?  And this could only be by showing her my faith and
trust.  If she was to go back to that dreadful charnel-house, she would
at least take with her the remembrance that one who loved her and whom
she loved--to whom she had been lately bound in the mystery of
marriage--trusted her to the full.  I loved her more than myself--more
than my own soul; and I was moved by pity so great that all possible
selfishness was merged in its depths.  I bowed my head before her--my
Lady and my Wife--as I said:

"So be it, my beloved.  I trust you to the full, even as you trust me.
And that has been proven this night, even to my own doubting heart.  I
shall wait; and as I know you wish it, I shall wait as patiently as I
can.  But till you come to me for good and all, let me see you or hear
from you when you can.  The time, dear wife, must go heavily with me as I
think of you suffering and lonely.  So be good to me, and let not too
long a time elapse between my glimpses of hope.  And, sweetheart, when
you _do_ come to me, it shall be for ever!"  There was something in the
intonation of the last sentence--I felt its sincerity myself--some
implied yearning for a promise, that made her beautiful eyes swim.  The
glorious stars in them were blurred as she answered with a fervour which
seemed to me as more than earthly:

"For ever!  I swear it!"

With one long kiss, and a straining in each others arms, which left me
tingling for long after we had lost sight of each other, we parted.  I
stood and watched her as her white figure, gliding through the deepening
gloom, faded as the forest thickened.  It surely was no optical delusion
or a phantom of the mind that her shrouded arm was raised as though in
blessing or farewell before the darkness swallowed her up.




BOOK VI: THE PURSUIT IN THE FOREST


RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                           _July_ 3, 1907.

There is no anodyne but work to pain of the heart; and my pain is all of
the heart.  I sometimes feel that it is rather hard that with so much to
make me happy I cannot know happiness.  How can I be happy when my wife,
whom I fondly love, and who I know loves me, is suffering in horror and
loneliness of a kind which is almost beyond human belief?  However, what
is my loss is my country's gain, for the Land of the Blue Mountains is my
country now, despite the fact that I am still a loyal subject of good
King Edward.  Uncle Roger took care of that when he said I should have
the consent of the Privy Council before I might be naturalized anywhere
else.

When I got home yesterday morning I naturally could not sleep.  The
events of the night and the bitter disappointment that followed my
exciting joy made such a thing impossible.  When I drew the curtain over
the window, the reflection of the sunrise was just beginning to tinge the
high-sailing clouds in front of me.  I laid down and tried to rest, but
without avail.  However, I schooled myself to lie still, and at last, if
I did not sleep, was at least quiescent.

Disturbed by a gentle tap at the door, I sprang up at once and threw on a
dressing gown.  Outside, when I opened the door, was Aunt Janet.  She was
holding a lighted candle in her hand, for though it was getting light in
the open, the passages were still dark.  When she saw me she seemed to
breathe more freely, and asked if she might come in.

Whilst she sat on the edge of my bed, in her old-time way, she said in a
hushed voice:

"Oh, laddie, laddie, I trust yer burden is no too heavy to bear."

"My burden!  What on earth do you mean, Aunt Janet?" I said in reply.  I
did not wish to commit myself by a definite answer, for it was evident
that she had been dreaming or Second Sighting again.  She replied with
the grim seriousness usual to her when she touched on occult matters:

"I saw your hairt bleeding, laddie.  I kent it was yours, though how I
kent it I don't know.  It lay on a stone floor in the dark, save for a
dim blue light such as corpse-lights are.  On it was placed a great book,
and close around were scattered many strange things, amongst them two
crowns o' flowers--the one bound wi' silver, the other wi' gold.  There
was also a golden cup, like a chalice, o'erturned.  The red wine trickled
from it an' mingled wi' yer hairt's bluid; for on the great book was some
vast dim weight wrapped up in black, and on it stepped in turn many men
all swathed in black.  An' as the weight of each came on it the bluid
gushed out afresh.  And oh, yer puir hairt, my laddie, was quick and
leaping, so that at every beat it raised the black-clad weight!  An' yet
that was not all, for hard by stood a tall imperial shape o' a woman, all
arrayed in white, wi' a great veil o' finest lace worn o'er a shrood.
An' she was whiter than the snow, an' fairer than the morn for beauty;
though a dark woman she was, wi' hair like the raven, an' eyes black as
the sea at nicht, an' there was stars in them.  An' at each beat o' yer
puir bleeding hairt she wrung her white hands, an' the manin' o' her
sweet voice rent my hairt in twain.  Oh, laddie, laddie! what does it
mean?"

I managed to murmur: "I'm sure I don't know, Aunt Janet.  I suppose it
was all a dream!"

"A dream it was, my dear.  A dream or a veesion, whilka matters nane, for
a' such are warnin's sent frae God . . . "  Suddenly she said in a
different voice:

"Laddie, hae ye been fause to any lassie?  I'm no blamin' ye.  For ye men
are different frae us women, an' yer regard on recht and wrang differs
from oors.  But oh, laddie, a woman's tears fa' heavy when her hairt is
for sair wi' the yieldin' to fause words.  'Tis a heavy burden for ony
man to carry wi' him as he goes, an' may well cause pain to ithers that
he fain would spare."  She stopped, and in dead silence waited for me to
speak.  I thought it would be best to set her poor loving heart at rest,
and as I could not divulge my special secret, spoke in general terms:

"Aunt Janet, I am a man, and have led a man's life, such as it is.  But I
can tell you, who have always loved me and taught me to be true, that in
all the world there is no woman who must weep for any falsity of mine.
If close there be any who, sleeping or waking, in dreams or visions or in
reality, weeps because of me, it is surely not for my doing, but because
of something outside me.  It may be that her heart is sore because I must
suffer, as all men must in some degree; but she does not weep for or
through any act of mine."

She sighed happily at my assurance, and looked up through her tears, for
she was much moved; and after tenderly kissing my forehead and blessing
me, stole away.  She was more sweet and tender than I have words to say,
and the only regret that I have in all that is gone is that I have not
been able to bring my wife to her, and let her share in the love she has
for me.  But that, too, will come, please God!

In the morning I sent a message to Rooke at Otranto, instructing him by
code to bring the yacht to Vissarion in the coming night.

All day I spent in going about amongst the mountaineers, drilling them
and looking after their arms.  I _could_ not stay still.  My only chance
of peace was to work, my only chance of sleep to tire myself out.
Unhappily, I am very strong, so even when I came home at dark I was quite
fresh.  However, I found a cable message from Rooke that the yacht would
arrive at midnight.

There was no need to summon the mountaineers, as the men in the Castle
would be sufficient to make preparations for the yacht's coming.

                                                                  _Later_.

The yacht has come.  At half-past eleven the lookout signalled that a
steamer without lights was creeping in towards the Creek.  I ran out to
the Flagstaff, and saw her steal in like a ghost.  She is painted a
steely blue-grey, and it is almost impossible to see her at any distance.
She certainly goes wonderfully.  Although there was not enough throb from
the engines to mar the absolute stillness, she came on at a fine speed,
and within a few minutes was close to the boom.  I had only time to run
down to give orders to draw back the boom when she glided in and stopped
dead at the harbour wall.  Rooke steered her himself, and he says he
never was on a boat that so well or so quickly answered her helm.  She is
certainly a beauty, and so far as I can see at night perfect in every
detail.  I promise myself a few pleasant hours over her in the daylight.
The men seem a splendid lot.

But I do not feel sleepy; I despair of sleep to-night.  But work demands
that I be fit for whatever may come, and so I shall try to sleep--to
rest, at any rate.



RUPERT'S JOURNAL.--_Continued_.


                                                           _July_ 4, 1907.

I was up with the first ray of sunrise, so by the time I had my bath and
was dressed there was ample light.  I went down to the dock at once, and
spent the morning looking over the vessel, which fully justifies Rooke's
enthusiasm about her.  She is built on lovely lines, and I can quite
understand that she is enormously fast.  Her armour I can only take on
the specifications, but her armament is really wonderful.  And there are
not only all the very newest devices of aggressive warfare--indeed, she
has the newest up-to-date torpedoes and torpedo-guns--but also the
old-fashioned rocket-tubes, which in certain occasions are so useful.
She has electric guns and the latest Massillon water-guns, and Reinhardt
electro-pneumatic "deliverers" for pyroxiline shells.  She is even
equipped with war-balloons easy of expansion, and with compressible
Kitson aeroplanes.  I don't suppose that there is anything quite like her
in the world.

The crew are worthy of her.  I can't imagine where Rooke picked up such a
splendid lot of men.  They are nearly all man-of-warsmen; of various
nationalities, but mostly British.  All young men--the oldest of them
hasn't got into the forties--and, so far as I can learn, all experts of
one kind or another in some special subject of warfare.  It will go hard
with me, but I shall keep them together.

How I got through the rest of the day I know not.  I tried hard not to
create any domestic trouble by my manner, lest Aunt Janet should, after
her lurid dream or vision of last night, attach some new importance to
it.  I think I succeeded, for she did not, so far as I could tell, take
any special notice of me.  We parted as usual at half-past ten, and I
came here and made this entry in my journal.  I am more restless than
ever to-night, and no wonder.  I would give anything to be able to pay a
visit to St. Sava's, and see my wife again--if it were only sleeping in
her tomb.  But I dare not do even that, lest she should come to see me
here, and I should miss her.  So I have done what I can.  The glass door
to the Terrace is open, so that she can enter at once if she comes.  The
fire is lit, and the room is warm.  There is food ready in case she
should care for it.  I have plenty of light in the room, so that through
the aperture where I have not fully drawn the curtain there may be light
to guide her.

Oh, how the time drags!  The clock has struck midnight.  One, two!  Thank
goodness, it will shortly be dawn, and the activity of the day may begin!
Work may again prove, in a way, to be an anodyne.  In the meantime I must
write on, lest despair overwhelm me.

Once during the night I thought I heard a footstep outside.  I rushed to
the window and looked out, but there was nothing to see, no sound to
hear.  That was a little after one o'clock.  I feared to go outside, lest
that should alarm her; so I came back to my table.  I could not write,
but I sat as if writing for a while.  But I could not stand it, so rose
and walked about the room.  As I walked I felt that my Lady--it gives me
a pang every time I remember that I do not know even her name--was not
quite so far away from me.  It made my heart beat to think that it might
mean that she was coming to me.  Could not I as well as Aunt Janet have a
little Second Sight!  I went towards the window, and, standing behind the
curtain, listened.  Far away I thought I heard a cry, and ran out on the
Terrace; but there was no sound to be heard, and no sign of any living
thing anywhere; so I took it for granted that it was the cry of some
night bird, and came back to my room, and wrote at my journal till I was
calm.  I think my nerves must be getting out of order, when every sound
of the night seems to have a special meaning for me.



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                            _July_ 7, 1907

When the grey of the morning came, I gave up hope of my wife appearing,
and made up my mind that, so soon as I could get away without exciting
Aunt Janet's attention, I would go to St. Sava's.  I always eat a good
breakfast, and did I forgo it altogether, it would be sure to excite her
curiosity--a thing I do not wish at present.  As there was still time to
wait, I lay down on my bed as I was, and--such is the way of
Fate--shortly fell asleep.

I was awakened by a terrific clattering at my door.  When I opened it I
found a little group of servants, very apologetic at awaking me without
instructions.  The chief of them explained that a young priest had come
from the Vladika with a message so urgent that he insisted on seeing me
immediately at all hazards.  I came out at once, and found him in the
hall of the Castle, standing before the great fire, which was always lit
in the early morning.  He had a letter in his hand, but before giving it
to me he said:

"I am sent by the Vladika, who pressed on me that I was not to lose a
single instant in seeing you; that time is of golden price--nay, beyond
price.  This letter, amongst other things, vouches for me.  A terrible
misfortune has occurred.  The daughter of our leader has disappeared
during last night--the same, he commanded me to remind you, that he spoke
of at the meeting when he would not let the mountaineers fire their guns.
No sign of her can be found, and it is believed that she has been carried
off by the emissaries of the Sultan of Turkey, who once before brought
our nations to the verge of war by demanding her as a wife.  I was also
to say that the Vladika Plamenac would have come himself, but that it was
necessary that he should at once consult with the Archbishop, Stevan
Palealogue, as to what step is best to take in this dire calamity.  He
has sent out a search-party under the Archimandrite of Spazac, Petrof
Vlastimir, who is to come on here with any news he can get, as you have
command of the signalling, and can best spread the news.  He knows that
you, Gospodar, are in your great heart one of our compatriots, and that
you have already proved your friendship by many efforts to strengthen our
hands for war.  And as a great compatriot, he calls on you to aid us in
our need."  He then handed me the letter, and stood by respectfully
whilst I broke the seal and read it.  It was written in great haste, and
signed by the Vladika.

"Come with us now in our nation's peril.  Help us to rescue what we most
adore, and henceforth we shall hold you in our hearts.  You shall learn
how the men of the Blue Mountains can love faith and valour.  Come!"

This was a task indeed--a duty worthy of any man.  It thrilled me to the
core to know that the men of the Blue Mountains had called on me in their
dire need.  It woke all the fighting instinct of my Viking forbears, and
I vowed in my heart that they should be satisfied with my work.  I called
to me the corps of signallers who were in the house, and led them to the
Castle roof, taking with me the young messenger-priest.

"Come with me," I said to him, "and see how I answer the Vladika's
command."

The National flag was run up--the established signal that the nation was
in need.  Instantly on every summit near and far was seen the flutter of
an answering flag.  Quickly followed the signal that commanded the call
to arms.

One by one I gave the signallers orders in quick succession, for the plan
of search unfolded itself to me as I went on.  The arms of the semaphore
whirled in a way that made the young priest stare.  One by one, as they
took their orders, the signallers seemed to catch fire.  Instinctively
they understood the plan, and worked like demigods.  They knew that so
widespread a movement had its best chance in rapidity and in unity of
action.

From the forest which lay in sight of the Castle came a wild cheering,
which seemed to interpret the former stillness of the hills.  It was good
to feel that those who saw the signals--types of many--were ready.  I saw
the look of expectation on the face of the messenger-priest, and rejoiced
at the glow that came as I turned to him to speak.  Of course, he wanted
to know something of what was going on.  I saw the flashing of my own
eyes reflected in his as I spoke:

"Tell the Vladika that within a minute of his message being read the Land
of the Blue Mountains was awake.  The mountaineers are already marching,
and before the sun is high there will be a line of guards within hail of
each other round the whole frontier--from Angusa to Ilsin; from Ilsin to
Bajana; from Bajana to Ispazar; from Ispazar to Volok; from Volok to
Tatra; from Tatra to Domitan; from Domitan to Gravaja; and from Gravaja
back to Angusa.  The line is double.  The old men keep guard on the line,
and the young men advance.  These will close in at the advancing line, so
that nothing can escape them.  They will cover mountain-top and forest
depth, and will close in finally on the Castle here, which they can
behold from afar.  My own yacht is here, and will sweep the coast from
end to end.  It is the fastest boat afloat, and armed against a squadron.
Here will all signals come.  In an hour where we stand will be a signal
bureau, where trained eyes will watch night and day till the lost one has
been found and the outrage has been avenged.  The robbers are even now
within a ring of steel, and cannot escape."

The young priest, all on fire, sprang on the battlements and shouted to
the crowd, which was massing round the Castle in the gardens far below.
The forest was giving up its units till they seemed like the nucleus of
an army.  The men cheered lustily, till the sound swung high up to us
like the roaring of a winter sea.  With bared heads they were crying:

"God and the Blue Mountains!  God and the Blue Mountains!"

I ran down to them as quickly as I could, and began to issue their
instructions.  Within a time to be computed by minutes the whole number,
organized by sections, had started to scour the neighbouring mountains.
At first they had only understood the call to arms for general safety.
But when they learned that the daughter of a chief had been captured,
they simply went mad.  From something which the messenger first said, but
which I could not catch or did not understand, the blow seemed to have
for them some sort of personal significance which wrought them to a
frenzy.

When the bulk of the men had disappeared, I took with me a few of my own
men and several of the mountaineers whom I had asked to remain, and
together we went to the hidden ravine which I knew.  We found the place
empty; but there were unmistakable signs that a party of men had been
encamped there for several days.  Some of our men, who were skilled in
woodcraft and in signs generally, agreed that there must have been some
twenty of them.  As they could not find any trail either coming to or
going from the place, they came to the conclusion that they must have
come separately from different directions and gathered there, and that
they must have departed in something of the same mysterious way.

However, this was, at any rate, some sort of a beginning, and the men
separated, having agreed amongst themselves to make a wide cast round the
place in the search for tracks.  Whoever should find a trail was to
follow with at least one comrade, and when there was any definite news,
it was to be signalled to the Castle.

I myself returned at once, and set the signallers to work to spread
amongst our own people such news as we had.

When presently such discoveries as had been made were signalled with
flags to the Castle, it was found that the marauders had, in their
flight, followed a strangely zigzag course.  It was evident that, in
trying to baffle pursuit, they had tried to avoid places which they
thought might be dangerous to them.  This may have been simply a method
to disconcert pursuit.  If so, it was, in a measure, excellent, for none
of those immediately following could possibly tell in what direction they
were heading.  It was only when we worked the course on the great map in
the signaller's room (which was the old guard room of the Castle) that we
could get an inkling of the general direction of their flight.  This gave
added trouble to the pursuit; for the men who followed, being ignorant of
their general intent, could not ever take chance to head them off, but
had to be ready to follow in any or every direction.  In this manner the
pursuit was altogether a stern chase, and therefore bound to be a long
one.

As at present we could not do anything till the intended route was more
marked, I left the signalling corps to the task of receiving and giving
information to the moving bands, so that, if occasion served, they might
head off the marauders.  I myself took Rooke, as captain of the yacht,
and swept out of the creek.  We ran up north to Dalairi, then down south
to Olesso, and came back to Vissarion.  We saw nothing suspicious except,
far off to the extreme southward, one warship which flew no flag.  Rooke,
however, who seemed to know ships by instinct, said she was a Turk; so on
our return we signalled along the whole shore to watch her.  Rooke held
The Lady--which was the name I had given the armoured yacht--in readiness
to dart out in case anything suspicious was reported.  He was not to
stand on any ceremony, but if necessary to attack.  We did not intend to
lose a point in this desperate struggle which we had undertaken.  We had
placed in different likely spots a couple of our own men to look after
the signalling.

When I got back I found that the route of the fugitives, who had now
joined into one party, had been definitely ascertained.  They had gone
south, but manifestly taking alarm from the advancing line of guards, had
headed up again to the north-east, where the country was broader and the
mountains wilder and less inhabited.

Forthwith, leaving the signalling altogether in the hands of the fighting
priests, I took a small chosen band of the mountaineers of our own
district, and made, with all the speed we could, to cut across the track
of the fugitives a little ahead of them.  The Archimandrite (Abbot) of
Spazac, who had just arrived, came with us.  He is a splendid man--a real
fighter as well as a holy cleric, as good with his handjar as with his
Bible, and a runner to beat the band.  The marauders were going at a
fearful pace, considering that they were all afoot; so we had to go fast
also!  Amongst these mountains there is no other means of progressing.
Our own men were so aflame with ardour that I could not but notice that
they, more than any of the others whom I had seen, had some special cause
for concern.

When I mentioned it to the Archimandrite, who moved by my side, he
answered:

"All natural enough; they are not only fighting for their country, but
for their own!"  I did not quite understand his answer, and so began to
ask him some questions, to the effect that I soon began to understand a
good deal more than he did.

_Letter from Archbishop Stevan Palealogue_, _Head of the Eastern Church
of the Blue Mountains_, _to the Lady Janet MacKelpie_, _Vissarion_.

                                                   _Written July_ 9, 1907.

    HONOURED LADY,

    As you wish for an understanding regarding the late lamentable
    occurrence in which so much danger was incurred to this our Land of
    the Blue Mountains, and one dear to us, I send these words by request
    of the Gospodar Rupert, beloved of our mountaineers.

    When the Voivode Peter Vissarion made his journey to the great nation
    to whom we looked in our hour of need, it was necessary that he
    should go in secret.  The Turk was at our gates, and full of the
    malice of baffled greed.  Already he had tried to arrange a marriage
    with the Voivodin, so that in time to come he, as her husband, might
    have established a claim to the inheritance of the land.  Well he
    knew, as do all men, that the Blue Mountaineers owe allegiance to
    none that they themselves do not appoint to rulership.  This has been
    the history in the past.  But now and again an individual has arisen
    or come to the front adapted personally for such government as this
    land requires.  And so the Lady Teuta, Voivodin of the Blue
    Mountains, was put for her proper guarding in the charge of myself as
    Head of the Eastern Church in the Land of the Blue Mountains, steps
    being taken in such wise that no capture of her could be effected by
    unscrupulous enemies of this our Land.  This task and guardianship
    was gladly held as an honour by all concerned.  For the Voivodin
    Teuta of Vissarion must be taken as representing in her own person
    the glory of the old Serb race, inasmuch as being the only child of
    the Voivode Vissarion, last male of his princely race--the race which
    ever, during the ten centuries of our history, unflinchingly gave
    life and all they held for the protection, safety, and well-being of
    the Land of the Blue Mountains.  Never during those centuries had any
    one of the race been known to fail in patriotism, or to draw back
    from any loss or hardship enjoined by high duty or stress of need.
    Moreover, this was the race of that first Voivode Vissarion, of whom,
    in legend, it was prophesied that he--once known as "The Sword of
    Freedom," a giant amongst men--would some day, when the nation had
    need of him, come forth from his water-tomb in the lost Lake of Reo,
    and lead once more the men of the Blue Mountains to lasting victory.
    This noble race, then, had come to be known as the last hope of the
    Land.  So that when the Voivode was away on his country's service,
    his daughter should be closely guarded.  Soon after the Voivode had
    gone, it was reported that he might be long delayed in his
    diplomacies, and also in studying the system of Constitutional
    Monarchy, for which it had been hoped to exchange our imperfect
    political system.  I may say _inter alia_ that he was mentioned as to
    be the first king when the new constitution should have been
    arranged.

    Then a great misfortune came on us; a terrible grief overshadowed the
    land.  After a short illness, the Voivodin Teuta Vissarion died
    mysteriously of a mysterious ailment.  The grief of the mountaineers
    was so great that it became necessary for the governing Council to
    warn them not to allow their sorrow to be seen.  It was imperatively
    necessary that the fact of her death should be kept secret.  For
    there were dangers and difficulties of several kinds.  In the first
    place it was advisable that even her father should be kept in
    ignorance of his terrible loss.  It was well known that he held her
    as the very core of his heart and that if he should hear of her
    death, he would be too much prostrated to be able to do the intricate
    and delicate work which he had undertaken.  Nay, more: he would never
    remain afar off, under the sad circumstances, but would straightway
    return, so as to be in the land where she lay.  Then suspicions would
    crop up, and the truth must shortly be known afield, with the
    inevitable result that the Land would become the very centre of a war
    of many nations.

    In the second place, if the Turks were to know that the race of
    Vissarion was becoming extinct, this would encourage them to further
    aggression, which would become immediate should they find out that
    the Voivode was himself away.  It was well known that they were
    already only suspending hostilities until a fitting opportunity
    should arise.  Their desire for aggression had become acute after the
    refusal of the nation, and of the girl herself, that she should
    become a wife of the Sultan.

    The dead girl had been buried in the Crypt of the church of St. Sava,
    and day after day and night after night, singly and in parties, the
    sorrowing mountaineers had come to pay devotion and reverence at her
    tomb.  So many had wished to have a last glimpse of her face that the
    Vladika had, with my own consent as Archbishop, arranged for a glass
    cover to be put over the stone coffin wherein her body lay.

    After a little time, however, there came a belief to all concerned in
    the guarding of the body--these, of course, being the priests of
    various degrees of dignity appointed to the task--that the Voivodin
    was not really dead, but only in a strangely-prolonged trance.
    Thereupon a new complication arose.  Our mountaineers are, as perhaps
    you know, by nature deeply suspicious--a characteristic of all brave
    and self-sacrificing people who are jealous of their noble heritage.
    Having, as they believed, seen the girl dead, they might not be
    willing to accept the fact of her being alive.  They might even
    imagine that there was on foot some deep, dark plot which was, or
    might be, a menace, now or hereafter, to their independence.  In any
    case, there would be certain to be two parties on the subject, a
    dangerous and deplorable thing in the present condition of affairs.

    As the trance, or catalepsy, whatever it was, continued for many
    days, there had been ample time for the leaders of the Council, the
    Vladika, the priesthood represented by the Archimandrite of Spazac,
    myself as Archbishop and guardian of the Voivodin in her father's
    absence, to consult as to a policy to be observed in case of the girl
    awaking.  For in such case the difficulty of the situation would be
    multiplied indefinitely.  In the secret chambers of St. Sava's we had
    many secret meetings, and were finally converging on agreement when
    the end of the trance came.

    The girl awoke!

    She was, of course, terribly frightened when she found herself in a
    tomb in the Crypt.  It was truly fortunate that the great candles
    around her tomb had been kept lighted, for their light mitigated the
    horror of the place.  Had she waked in darkness, her reason might
    have become unseated.

    She was, however, a very noble girl; brave, with extraordinary will,
    and resolution, and self-command, and power of endurance.  When she
    had been taken into one of the secret chambers of the church, where
    she was warmed and cared for, a hurried meeting was held by the
    Vladika, myself, and the chiefs of the National Council.  Word had
    been at once sent to me of the joyful news of her recovery; and with
    the utmost haste I came, arriving in time to take a part in the
    Council.

    At the meeting the Voivodin was herself present, and full confidence
    of the situation was made to her.  She herself proposed that the
    belief in her death should be allowed to prevail until the return of
    her father, when all could be effectively made clear.  To this end
    she undertook to submit to the terrific strain which such a
    proceeding would involve.  At first we men could not believe that any
    woman could go through with such a task, and some of us did not
    hesitate to voice our doubts--our disbelief.  But she stood to her
    guns, and actually down-faced us.  At the last we, remembering things
    that had been done, though long ages ago, by others of her race, came
    to believe not merely in her self-belief and intention, but even in
    the feasibility of her plan.  She took the most solemn oaths not to
    betray the secret under any possible stress.

    The priesthood undertook through the Vladika and myself to further a
    ghostly belief amongst the mountaineers which would tend to prevent a
    too close or too persistent observation.  The Vampire legend was
    spread as a protection against partial discovery by any mischance,
    and other weird beliefs were set afoot and fostered.  Arrangements
    were made that only on certain days were the mountaineers to be
    admitted to the Crypt, she agreeing that for these occasions she was
    to take opiates or carry out any other aid to the preservation of the
    secret.  She was willing, she impressed upon us, to make any personal
    sacrifice which might be deemed necessary for the carrying out her
    father's task for the good of the nation.

    Of course, she had at first terrible frights lying alone in the
    horror of the Crypt.  But after a time the terrors of the situation,
    if they did not cease, were mitigated.  There are secret caverns off
    the Crypt, wherein in troublous times the priests and others of high
    place have found safe retreat.  One of these was prepared for the
    Voivodin, and there she remained, except for such times as she was on
    show--and certain other times of which I shall tell you.  Provision
    was made for the possibility of any accidental visit to the church.
    At such times, warned by an automatic signal from the opening door,
    she was to take her place in the tomb.  The mechanism was so arranged
    that the means to replace the glass cover, and to take the opiate,
    were there ready to her hand.  There was to be always a watch of
    priests at night in the church, to guard her from ghostly fears as
    well as from more physical dangers; and if she was actually in her
    tomb, it was to be visited at certain intervals.  Even the draperies
    which covered her in the sarcophagus were rested on a bridge placed
    from side to side just above her, so as to hide the rising and
    falling of her bosom as she slept under the narcotic.

    After a while the prolonged strain began to tell so much on her that
    it was decided that she should take now and again exercise out of
    doors.  This was not difficult, for when the Vampire story which we
    had spread began to be widely known, her being seen would be accepted
    as a proof of its truth.  Still, as there was a certain danger in her
    being seen at all, we thought it necessary to exact from her a solemn
    oath that so long as her sad task lasted she should under no
    circumstances ever wear any dress but her shroud--this being the only
    way to insure secrecy and to prevail against accident.

    There is a secret way from the Crypt to a sea cavern, whose entrance
    is at high-tide under the water-line at the base of the cliff on
    which the church is built.  A boat, shaped like a coffin, was
    provided for her; and in this she was accustomed to pass across the
    creek whenever she wished to make excursion.  It was an excellent
    device, and most efficacious in disseminating the Vampire belief.

    This state of things had now lasted from before the time when the
    Gospodar Rupert came to Vissarion up to the day of the arrival of the
    armoured yacht.

    That night the priest on duty, on going his round of the Crypt just
    before dawn, found the tomb empty.  He called the others, and they
    made full search.  The boat was gone from the cavern, but on making
    search they found it on the farther side of the creek, close to the
    garden stairs.  Beyond this they could discover nothing.  She seemed
    to have disappeared without leaving a trace.

    Straightway they went to the Vladika, and signalled to me by the
    fire-signal at the monastery at Astrag, where I then was.  I took a
    band of mountaineers with me, and set out to scour the country.  But
    before going I sent an urgent message to the Gospodar Rupert, asking
    him, who showed so much interest and love to our Land, to help us in
    our trouble.  He, of course, knew nothing then of all have now told
    you.  Nevertheless, he devoted himself whole-heartedly to our
    needs--as doubtless you know.

    But the time had now come close when the Voivode Vissarion was about
    to return from his mission; and we of the council of his daughter's
    guardianship were beginning to arrange matters so that at his return
    the good news of her being still alive could be made public.  With
    her father present to vouch for her, no question as to truth could
    arise.

    But by some means the Turkish "Bureau of Spies" must have got
    knowledge of the fact already.  To steal a dead body for the purpose
    of later establishing a fictitious claim would have been an
    enterprise even more desperate than that already undertaken.  We
    inferred from many signs, made known to us in an investigation, that
    a daring party of the Sultan's emissaries had made a secret incursion
    with the object of kidnapping the Voivodin.  They must have been bold
    of heart and strong of resource to enter the Land of the Blue
    Mountains on any errand, let alone such a desperate one as this.  For
    centuries we have been teaching the Turk through bitter lessons that
    it is neither a safe task nor an easy one to make incursion here.

    How they did it we know not--at present; but enter they did, and,
    after waiting in some secret hiding-place for a favourable
    opportunity, secured their prey.  We know not even now whether they
    had found entrance to the Crypt and stole, as they thought, the dead
    body, or whether, by some dire mischance, they found her
    abroad--under her disguise as a ghost.  At any rate, they had
    captured her, and through devious ways amongst the mountains were
    bearing her back to Turkey.  It was manifest that when she was on
    Turkish soil the Sultan would force a marriage on her so as
    eventually to secure for himself or his successors as against all
    other nations a claim for the suzerainty or guardianship of the Blue
    Mountains.

    Such was the state of affairs when the Gospodar Rupert threw himself
    into the pursuit with fiery zeal and the Berserk passion which he
    inherited from Viking ancestors, whence of old came "The Sword of
    Freedom" himself.

    But at that very time was another possibility which the Gospodar was
    himself the first to realize.  Failing the getting the Voivodin safe
    to Turkish soil, the ravishers might kill her!  This would be
    entirely in accord with the base traditions and history of the
    Moslems.  So, too, it would accord with Turkish customs and the
    Sultan's present desires.  It would, in its way, benefit the ultimate
    strategetic ends of Turkey.  For were once the Vissarion race at an
    end, the subjection of the Land of the Blue Mountains might, in their
    view, be an easier task than it had yet been found to be.

    Such, illustrious lady, were the conditions of affairs when the
    Gospodar Rupert first drew his handjar for the Blue Mountains and
    what it held most dear.

                                                               PALEALOGUE,
              _Archbishop of the Eastern Church_, _in the Land of the Blue
                                                               Mountains_.



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                           _July_ 8, 1907.

I wonder if ever in the long, strange history of the world had there come
to any other such glad tidings as came to me--and even then rather
inferentially than directly--from the Archimandrite's answers to my
questioning.  Happily I was able to restrain myself, or I should have
created some strange confusion which might have evoked distrust, and
would certainly have hampered us in our pursuit.  For a little I could
hardly accept the truth which wove itself through my brain as the true
inwardness of each fact came home to me and took its place in the whole
fabric.  But even the most welcome truth has to be accepted some time by
even a doubting heart.  My heart, whatever it may have been, was not then
a doubting heart, but a very, very grateful one.  It was only the
splendid magnitude of the truth which forbade its immediate acceptance.
I could have shouted for joy, and only stilled myself by keeping my
thoughts fixed on the danger which my wife was in.  My wife!  My wife!
Not a Vampire; not a poor harassed creature doomed to terrible woe, but a
splendid woman, brave beyond belief, patriotic in a way which has but few
peers even in the wide history of bravery!  I began to understand the
true meaning of the strange occurrences that have come into my life.
Even the origin and purpose of that first strange visit to my room became
clear.  No wonder that the girl could move about the Castle in so
mysterious a manner.  She had lived there all her life, and was familiar
with the secret ways of entrance and exit.  I had always believed that
the place must have been honeycombed with secret passages.  No wonder
that she could find a way to the battlements, mysterious to everybody
else.  No wonder that she could meet me at the Flagstaff when she so
desired.

To say that I was in a tumult would be to but faintly express my
condition.  I was rapt into a heaven of delight which had no measure in
all my adventurous life--the lifting of the veil which showed that my
wife--mine--won in all sincerity in the very teeth of appalling
difficulties and dangers--was no Vampire, no corpse, no ghost or phantom,
but a real woman of flesh and blood, of affection, and love, and passion.
Now at last would my love be crowned indeed when, having rescued her from
the marauders, I should bear her to my own home, where she would live and
reign in peace and comfort and honour, and in love and wifely happiness
if I could achieve such a blessing for her--and for myself.

But here a dreadful thought flashed across me, which in an instant turned
my joy to despair, my throbbing heart to ice:

"As she is a real woman, she is in greater danger than ever in the hands
of Turkish ruffians.  To them a woman is in any case no more than a
sheep; and if they cannot bring her to the harem of the Sultan, they may
deem it the next wisest step to kill her.  In that way, too, they might
find a better chance of escape.  Once rid of her the party could
separate, and there might be a chance of some of them finding escape as
individuals that would not exist for a party.  But even if they did not
kill her, to escape with her would be to condemn her to the worst fate of
all the harem of the Turk!  Lifelong misery and despair--however long
that life might be--must be the lot of a Christian woman doomed to such a
lot.  And to her, just happily wedded, and after she had served her
country in such a noble way as she had done, that dreadful life of
shameful slavery would be a misery beyond belief.

"She must be rescued--and quickly!  The marauders must be caught soon,
and suddenly, so that they may have neither time nor opportunity to harm
her, as they would be certain to do if they have warning of immediate
danger.

"On! on!"

And "on" it was all through that terrible night as well as we could
through the forest.

It was a race between the mountaineers and myself as to who should be
first.  I understood now the feeling that animated them, and which
singled them out even from amongst their fiery comrades, when the danger
of the Voivodin became known.  These men were no mean contestants even in
such a race, and, strong as I am, it took my utmost effort to keep ahead
of them.  They were keen as leopards, and as swift.  Their lives had been
spent among the mountains, and their hearts and souls on were in the
chase.  I doubt not that if the death of any one of us could have through
any means effected my wife's release, we should, if necessary, have
fought amongst ourselves for the honour.

From the nature of the work before us our party had to keep to the top of
the hills.  We had not only to keep observation on the flying party whom
we followed, and to prevent them making discovery of us, but we had to be
always in a position to receive and answer signals made to us from the
Castle, or sent to us from other eminences.

_Letter from Petrof Vlastimir_, _Archimandrite of Spazac_, _to the Lady
Janet MacKelpie_, _of Vissarion_.

                                                   _Written July_ 8, 1907.

    GREAT LADY,

    I am asked to write by the Vladika, and have permission of the
    Archbishop.  I have the honour of transmitting to you the record of
    the pursuit of the Turkish spies who carried off the Voivodin Teuta,
    of the noble House of Vissarion.  The pursuit was undertaken by the
    Gospodar Rupert, who asked that I would come with his party, since
    what he was so good as to call my "great knowledge of the country and
    its people" might serve much.  It is true that I have had much
    knowledge of the Land of the Blue Mountains and its people, amongst
    which and whom my whole life has been passed.  But in such a cause no
    reason was required.  There was not a man in the Blue Mountains who
    would not have given his life for the Voivodin Teuta, and when they
    heard that she had not been dead, as they thought, but only in a
    trance, and that it was she whom the marauders had carried off, they
    were in a frenzy.  So why should I--to whom has been given the great
    trust of the Monastery of Spazac--hesitate at such a time?  For
    myself, I wanted to hurry on, and to come at once to the fight with
    my country's foes; and well I knew that the Gospodar Rupert, with a
    lion's heart meet for his giant body, would press on with a matchless
    speed.  We of the Blue Mountains do not lag when our foes are in
    front of us; most of all do we of the Eastern Church press on when
    the Crescent wars against the Cross!

    We took with us no gear or hamper of any kind; no coverings except
    what we stood in; no food--nothing but our handjars and our rifles,
    with a sufficiency of ammunition.  Before starting, the Gospodar gave
    hurried orders by signal from the Castle to have food and ammunition
    sent to us (as we might signal) by the nearest hamlet.

    It was high noon when we started, only ten strong--for our leader
    would take none but approved runners who could shoot straight and use
    the handjar as it should be used.  So as we went light, we expected
    to go fast.  By this time we knew from the reports signalled to
    Vissarion that the enemies were chosen men of no despicable prowess.

    The Keeper of the Green Flag of Islam is well served, and as though
    the Turk is an infidel and a dog, he is sometimes brave and strong.
    Indeed, except when he passes the confines of the Blue Mountains, he
    has been known to do stirring deeds.  But as none who have dared to
    wander in amongst our hills ever return to their own land, we may not
    know of how they speak at home of their battles here.  Still, these
    men were evidently not to be despised; and our Gospodar, who is a
    wise man as well as a valiant, warned us to be prudent, and not to
    despise our foes over much.  We did as he counselled, and in proof we
    only took ten men, as we had only twenty against us.  But then there
    was at stake much beyond life, and we took no risks.  So, as the
    great clock at Vissarion clanged of noon, the eight fastest runners
    of the Blue Mountains, together with the Gospodar Rupert and myself,
    swept out on our journey.  It had been signalled to us that the
    course which the marauders had as yet taken in their flight was a
    zigzag one, running eccentrically at all sorts of angles in all sorts
    of directions.  But our leader had marked out a course where we might
    intercept our foes across the main line of their flight; and till we
    had reached that region we paused not a second, but went as fast as
    we could all night long.  Indeed, it was amongst us a race as was the
    Olympic race of old Greece, each one vying with his fellows, though
    not in jealous emulation, but in high spirit, to best serve his
    country and the Voivodin Teuta.  Foremost amongst us went the
    Gospodar, bearing himself as a Paladin of old, his mighty form
    pausing for no obstacle.  Perpetually did he urge us on.  He would
    not stop or pause for a moment, but often as he and I ran
    together--for, lady, in my youth I was the fleetest of all in the
    race, and even that now can head a battalion when duty calls--he
    would ask me certain questions as to the Lady Teuta and of the
    strange manner of her reputed death, as it was gradually unfolded in
    my answers to his questioning.  And as each new phase of knowledge
    came to him, he would rush on as one possessed of fiends: whereat our
    mountaineers, who seem to respect even fiends for their thoroughness,
    would strive to keep pace with him till they too seemed worked into
    diabolic possession.  And I myself, left alone in the calmness of
    sacerdotal office, forgot even that.  With surging ears and eyes that
    saw blood, I rushed along with best of them.

    Then truly the spirit of a great captain showed itself in the
    Gospodar, for when others were charged with fury he began to force
    himself into calm, so that out of his present self-command and the
    memory of his exalted position came a worthy strategy and thought for
    every contingency that might arise.  So that when some new direction
    was required for our guidance, there was no hesitation in its coming.
    We, nine men of varying kinds, all felt that we had a master; and so,
    being willing to limit ourselves to strict obedience, we were free to
    use such thoughts as well as such powers as we had to the best
    advantage of the doing.

    We came across the trail of the flying marauders on the second
    morning after the abduction, a little before noon.  It was easy
    enough to see, for by this time the miscreants were all together, and
    our people, who were woodlanders, were able to tell much of the party
    that passed.  These were evidently in a terrified hurry, for they had
    taken no precautions such as are necessary baffle pursuit, and all of
    which take time.  Our foresters said that two went ahead and two
    behind.  In the centre went the mass, moving close together, as
    though surrounding their prisoner.  We caught not even a single
    glimpse her--could not have, they encompassed her so closely.  But
    our foresters saw other than the mass; the ground that had been
    passed was before them.  They knew that the prisoner had gone
    unwillingly--nay, more: one of them said as he rose from his knees,
    where he had been examining of the ground:

    "The misbegotten dogs have been urging her on with their yataghans!
    There are drops of blood, though there are no blood-marks on her
    feet."

    Whereupon the Gospodar flamed with passion.  His teeth ground
    together, and with a deep-breathed "On, on!" he sprang off again,
    handjar in hand, on the track.

    Before long we saw the party in the distance.  They this were far
    below us in a deep valley, although the track of their going passed
    away to the right hand.  They were making for the base of the great
    cliff, which rose before us all.  Their reason was twofold, as we
    soon knew.  Far off down the valley which they were crossing we saw
    signs of persons coming in haste, who must be of the search party
    coming from the north.  Though the trees hid them, we could not
    mistake the signs.  I was myself forester enough to have no doubt.
    Again, it was evident that the young Voivodin could travel no longer
    at the dreadful pace at which they had been going.  Those blood-marks
    told their own tale!  They meant to make a last stand here in case
    they should be discovered.

    Then it was that he, who amongst us all had been most fierce and most
    bent on rapid pursuit, became the most the calm.  Raising his hand
    for silence--though, God knows, we were and had been silent enough
    during that long rush through the forest--he said, in a low, keen
    whisper which cut the silence like a knife:

    "My friends, the time is come for action.  God be thanked, who has
    now brought us face to face with our foes!  But we must be careful
    here--not on our own account, for we wish nothing more than to rush
    on and conquer or die--but for the sake of her whom you love, and
    whom I, too, love.  She is in danger from anything which may give
    warning to those fiends.  If they know or even suspect for an instant
    that we are near, they will murder her . . . "

    Here his voice broke for an instant with the extremity of his passion
    or the depth of his feeling--I hardly know which; I think both acted
    on him.

    "We know from those blood-marks what they can do--even to her."  His
    teeth ground together again, but he went on without stopping further:

    "Let us arrange the battle.  Though we are but little distance from
    them as the crow flies, the way is far to travel.  There is, I can
    see, but one path down to the valley from this side.  That they have
    gone by, and that they will sure to guard--to watch, at any rate.
    Let us divide, as to surround them.  The cliff towards which they
    make runs far to the left without a break.  That to the right we
    cannot see from this spot; but from the nature of the ground it is
    not unlikely that it turns round in this direction, making the hither
    end of the valley like a vast pocket or amphitheatre.  As they have
    studied the ground in other places, they may have done so in this,
    and have come hither as to a known refuge.  Let one man, a marksman,
    stay here."

    As he spoke a man stepped to the front.  He was, I knew, an excellent
    shot.

    "Let two others go to the left and try to find a way down the cliff
    before us.  When they have descended to the level of the valley--path
    or no path--let them advance cautiously and secretly, keeping their
    guns in readiness.  But they must not fire till need.  Remember, my
    brothers," said, turning to those who stepped out a pace or two to
    the left, "that the first shot gives the warning which will be the
    signal for the Voivodin's death.  These men will not hesitate.  You
    must judge yourselves of the time to shoot.  The others of us will
    move to the right and try to find a path on that side.  If the valley
    be indeed a pocket between the cliffs, we must find a way down that
    is not a path!"

    As he spoke thus there was a blaze in his eyes that betokened no good
    to aught that might stand in his way.  I ran by his side as we moved
    to the right.

    It was as he surmised about the cliff.  When we got a little on our
    way we saw how the rocky formation trended to our right, till,
    finally, with a wide curve, it came round to the other side.

    It was a fearful valley that, with its narrow girth and its towering
    walls that seemed to topple over.  On the farther side from us the
    great trees that clothed the slope of the mountain over it grew down
    to the very edge of the rock, so that their spreading branches hung
    far over the chasm.  And, so far as we could understand, the same
    condition existed on our own side.  Below us the valley was dark even
    in the daylight.  We could best tell the movement of the flying
    marauders by the flashes of the white shroud of their captive in the
    midst of them.

    From where we were grouped, amid the great tree-trunks on the very
    brow of the cliff, we could, when our eyes were accustomed to the
    shadow, see them quite well.  In great haste, and half dragging, half
    carrying the Voivodin, they crossed the open space and took refuge in
    a little grassy alcove surrounded, save for its tortuous entrance, by
    undergrowth.  From the valley level it was manifestly impossible to
    see them, though we from our altitude could see over the stunted
    undergrowth.  When within the glade, they took their hands from her.
    She, shuddering instinctively, withdrew to a remote corner of the
    dell.

    And then, oh, shame on their manhood!--Turks and heathens though they
    were--we could see that they had submitted her to the indignity of
    gagging her and binding her hands!

    Our Voivodin Teuta bound!  To one and all of us it was like lashing
    us across the face.  I heard the Gospodar's teeth grind again.  But
    once more he schooled himself to calmness ere he said:

    "It is, perhaps, as well, great though the indignity be.  They are
    seeking their own doom, which is coming quickly . . . Moreover, they
    are thwarting their own base plans.  Now that she is bound they will
    trust to their binding, so that they will delay their murderous
    alternative to the very last moment.  Such is our chance of rescuing
    her alive!"

    For a few moments he stood as still as a stone, as though revolving
    something in his mind whilst he watched.  I could see that some grim
    resolution was forming in his mind, for his eyes ranged to the top of
    the trees above cliff, and down again, very slowly this time, as
    though measuring and studying the detail of what was in front of him.
    Then he spoke:

    "They are in hopes that the other pursuing party may not come across
    them.  To know that, they are waiting.  If those others do not come
    up the valley, they will proceed on their way.  They will return up
    the path the way they came.  There we can wait them, charge into the
    middle of them when she is opposite, and cut down those around her.
    Then the others will open fire, and we shall be rid of them!

    Whilst he was speaking, two of the men of our party, who I knew to be
    good sharpshooters, and who had just before lain on their faces and
    had steadied their rifles to shoot, rose to their feet.

    "Command us, Gospodar!" they said simply, as they stood to attention.
    "Shall we go to the head of the ravine road and there take hiding?"
    He thought for perhaps a minute, whilst we all stood as silent as
    images.  I could hear our hearts beating.  Then he said:

    "No, not yet.  There is time for that yet.  They will not--cannot
    stir or make plans in any way till they know whether the other party
    is coming towards them or not.  From our height here we can see what
    course the others are taking long before those villains do.  Then we
    can make our plans and be ready in time."

    We waited many minutes, but could see no further signs the other
    pursuing party.  These had evidently adopted greater caution in their
    movements as they came closer to where they expected to find the
    enemy.  The marauders began to grow anxious.  Even at our distance we
    could gather as much from their attitude and movements.

    Presently, when the suspense of their ignorance grew too much for
    them, they drew to the entrance of the glade, which was the farthest
    place to which, without exposing themselves to anyone who might come
    to the valley, they could withdraw from their captive.  Here they
    consulted together.  We could follow from their gestures what they
    were saying, for as they did not wish their prisoner to hear, their
    gesticulation was enlightening to us as to each other.  Our people,
    like all mountaineers, have good eyes, and the Gospodar is himself an
    eagle in this as in other ways.  Three men stood back from the rest.
    They stacked their rifles so that they could seize them easily.  Then
    they drew their scimitars, and stood ready, as though on guard.

    These were evidently the appointed murderers.  Well they knew their
    work; for though they stood in a desert place with none within long
    distance except the pursuing party, of whose approach they would have
    good notice, they stood so close to their prisoner that no marksman
    in the world--now or that ever had been; not William Tell
    himself--could have harmed any of them without at least endangering
    her.  Two of them turned the Voivodin round so that her face was
    towards the precipice--in which position she could not see what was
    going on--whilst he who was evidently leader of the gang explained,
    in gesture, that the others were going to spy upon the pursuing
    party.  When they had located them he, or one of his men, would come
    out of the opening of the wood wherein they had had evidence of them,
    and hold up his hand.

    That was to be the signal for the cutting of the victim's
    throat--such being the chosen method (villainous even for heathen
    murderers) of her death.  There was not one of our men who did not
    grind his teeth when we witnessed the grim action, only too
    expressive, of the Turk as he drew his right hand, clenched as though
    he held a yataghan in it, across his throat.

    At the opening of the glade all the spying party halted whilst the
    leader appointed to each his place of entry of the wood, the front of
    which extended in an almost straight across the valley from cliff to
    cliff.

    The men, stooping low when in the open, and taking instant advantage
    of every little obstacle on the ground, seemed to fade like spectres
    with incredible swiftness across the level mead, and were swallowed
    up in the wood.

    When they had disappeared the Gospodar Rupert revealed to us the
    details of the plan of action which he had revolving in his mind.  He
    motioned us to follow him: we threaded a way between the tree-trunks,
    keeping all the while on the very edge of the cliff, so that the
    space below was all visible to us.  When we had got round the curve
    sufficiently to see the whole of the wood on the valley level,
    without losing sight of the Voivodin and her appointed assassins, we
    halted under his direction.  There was an added advantage of this
    point over the other, for we could see directly the rising of the
    hill-road, up which farther side ran the continuation of the mountain
    path which the marauders had followed.  It was somewhere on that path
    that the other pursuing party had hoped to intercept the fugitives.
    The Gospodar spoke quickly, though in a voice of command which true
    soldiers love to hear:

    "Brothers, the time has come when we can strike a blow for Teuta and
    the Land.  Do you two, marksmen, take position here facing the wood."
    The two men here lay down and got their rifles ready.  "Divide the
    frontage of the wood between you; arrange between yourselves the
    limits of your positions.  The very instant one of the marauders
    appears, cover him; drop him before he emerges from the wood.  Even
    then still watch and treat similarly whoever else may take his place.
    Do this if they come singly till not a man is left.  Remember,
    brothers, that brave hearts alone will not suffice at this grim
    crisis.  In this hour the best safety of the Voivodin is in the calm
    spirit and the steady eye!"  Then he turned to the rest of us, and
    spoke to me:

    "Archimandrite of Plazac, you who are interpreter to God of the
    prayers of so many souls, my own hour has come.  If I do not return,
    convey my love to my Aunt Janet--Miss MacKelpie, at Vissarion.  There
    is but one thing left to us if we wish to save the Voivodin.  Do you,
    when the time comes, take these men and join the watcher at the top
    of the ravine road.  When the shots are fired, do you out handjar,
    and rush the ravine and across the valley.  Brothers, you may be in
    time to avenge the Voivodin, if you cannot save her.  For me there
    must be a quicker way, and to it I go.  As there is not, and will not
    be, time to traverse the path, I must take a quicker way.  Nature
    finds me a path that man has made it necessary for me to travel.  See
    that giant beech-tree that towers above the glade where the Voivodin
    is held?  There is my path!  When you from here have marked the
    return of the spies, give me a signal with your hat--do not use a
    handkerchief, as others might see its white, and take warning.  Then
    rush that ravine.  I shall take that as the signal for my descent by
    the leafy road.  If I can do naught else, I can crush the murderers
    with my falling weight, even if I have to kill her too.  At least we
    shall die together--and free.  Lay us together in the tomb at St.
    Sava's.  Farewell, if it be the last!"

    He threw down the scabbard in which he carried his handjar, adjusted
    the naked weapon in his belt behind his back, and was gone!

    We who were not watching the wood kept our eyes fixed on the great
    beech-tree, and with new interest noticed the long trailing branches
    which hung low, and swayed even in the gentle breeze.  For a few
    minutes, which seemed amazingly long, we saw no sign of him.  Then,
    high up on one of the great branches which stood clear of obscuring
    leaves, we saw something crawling flat against the bark.  He was well
    out on the branch, hanging far over the precipice.  He was looking
    over at us, and I waved my hand so that he should know we saw him.
    He was clad in green--his usual forest dress--so that there was not
    any likelihood of any other eyes noticing him.  I took off my hat,
    and held it ready to signal with when the time should come.  I
    glanced down at the glade and saw the Voivodin standing, still safe,
    with her guards so close to her as to touch.  Then I, too, fixed my
    eyes on the wood.

    Suddenly the man standing beside me seized my arm and pointed.  I
    could just see through the trees, which were lower than elsewhere in
    the front of the wood, a Turk moving stealthily; so I waved my hat.
    At the same time a rifle underneath me cracked.  A second or two
    later the spy pitched forward on his face and lay still.  At the same
    instant my eyes sought the beech-tree, and I saw the close-lying
    figure raise itself and slide forward to a joint of the branch.  Then
    the Gospodar, as he rose, hurled himself forward amid the mass of the
    trailing branches.  He dropped like a stone, and my heart sank.

    But an instant later he seemed in poise.  He had clutched the thin,
    trailing branches as he fell; and as he sank a number of leaves which
    his motion had torn off floated out round him.

    Again the rifle below me cracked, and then again, and again, and
    again.  The marauders had taken warning, and were coming out in mass.
    But my own eyes were fixed on the tree.  Almost as a thunderbolt
    falls fell the giant body of the Gospodar, his size lost in the
    immensity of his surroundings.  He fell in a series of jerks, as he
    kept clutching the trailing beech-branches whilst they lasted, and
    then other lesser verdure growing out from the fissures in the rock
    after the lengthening branches had with all their elasticity reached
    their last point.

    At length--for though this all took place in a very few seconds the
    gravity of the crisis prolonged them immeasurably--there came a large
    space of rock some three times his own length.  He did not pause, but
    swung himself to one side, so that he should fall close to the
    Voivodin and her guards.  These men did not seem to notice, for their
    attention was fixed on the wood whence they expected their messenger
    to signal.  But they raised their yataghans in readiness.  The shots
    had alarmed them; and they meant to do the murder now--messenger or
    no messenger

    But though the men did not see the danger from above, the Voivodin
    did.  She raised her eyes quickly at the first sound, and even from
    where we were, before we began to run towards the ravine path, I
    could see the triumphant look in her glorious eyes when she
    recognized the identity of the man who was seemingly coming straight
    down from Heaven itself to help her--as, indeed, she, and we too, can
    very well imagine that he did; for if ever heaven had a hand in a
    rescue on earth, it was now.

    Even during the last drop from the rocky foliage the Gospodar kept
    his head.  As he fell he pulled his handjar free, and almost as he
    was falling its sweep took off the head of one of the assassins.  As
    he touched ground he stumbled for an instant, but it was towards his
    enemies.  Twice with lightning rapidity the handjar swept the air,
    and at each sweep a head rolled on the sward.

    The Voivodin held up her tied hands.  Again the handjar flashed, this
    time downwards, and the lady was free.  Without an instant's pause
    the Gospodar tore off the gag, and with his left arm round her and
    handjar in right hand, stood face toward his living foes.  The
    Voivodin stooped suddenly, and then, raising the yataghan which had
    fallen from the hand of one of the dead marauders, stood armed beside
    him.

    The rifles were now cracking fast, as the marauders--those that were
    left of them--came rushing out into the open.  But well the marksmen
    knew their work.  Well they bore in mind the Gospodar's command
    regarding calmness.  They kept picking off the foremost men only, so
    that the onward rush never seemed to get more forward.

    As we rushed down the ravine we could see clearly all before us.  But
    now, just as we were beginning to fear lest some mischance might
    allow some of them to reach the glade, there was another cause of
    surprise--of rejoicing.

    From the face of the wood seemed to burst all at once a body of men,
    all wearing the national cap, so we knew them as our own.  They were
    all armed with the handjar only, and they came like tigers.  They
    swept on the rushing Turks as though, for all their swiftness, they
    were standing still--literally wiping them out as a child wipes a
    lesson from its slate.

    A few seconds later these were followed by a tall figure with long
    hair and beard of black mingled with grey.  Instinctively we all, as
    did those in the valley, shouted with joy.  For this was the Vladika
    Milosh Plamenac himself.

    I confess that, knowing what I knew, I was for a short space of time
    anxious lest, in the terrific excitement in which we were all lapped,
    someone might say or do something which might make for trouble later
    on.  The Gospodar's splendid achievement, which was worthy of any
    hero of old romance, had set us all on fire.  He himself must have
    been wrought to a high pitch of excitement to dare such an act; and
    it is not at such a time that discretion must be expected from any
    man.  Most of all did I fear danger from the womanhood of the
    Voivodin.  Had I not assisted at her marriage, I might not have
    understood then what it must have been to her to be saved from such a
    doom at such a time by such a man, who was so much to her, and in
    such a way.  It would have been only natural if at such a moment of
    gratitude and triumph she had proclaimed the secret which we of the
    Council of the Nation and her father's Commissioners had so
    religiously kept.  But none of us knew then either the Voivodin or
    the Gospodar Rupert as we do now.  It was well that they were as they
    are, for the jealousy and suspicion of our mountaineers might, even
    at such a moment, and even whilst they throbbed at such a deed, have
    so manifested themselves as to have left a legacy of distrust.  The
    Vladika and I, who of all (save the two immediately concerned) alone
    knew, looked at each other apprehensively.  But at that instant the
    Voivodin, with a swift glance at her husband, laid a finger on her
    lip; and he, with quick understanding, gave assurance by a similar
    sign.  Then she sank before him on one knee, and, raising his hand to
    her lips, kissed it, and spoke:

    "Gospodar Rupert, I owe you all that a woman may owe, except to God.
    You have given me life and honour!  I cannot thank you adequately for
    what you have done; my father will try to do so when he returns.  But
    I am right sure that the men of the Blue Mountains, who so value
    honour, and freedom, and liberty, and bravery, will hold you in their
    hearts for ever!"

    This was so sweetly spoken, with lips that trembled and eyes that
    swam in tears, so truly womanly and so in accord with the custom of
    our nation regarding the reverence that women owe to men, that the
    hearts of our mountaineers were touched to the quick.  Their noble
    simplicity found expression in tears.  But if the gallant Gospodar
    could have for a moment thought that so to weep was unmanly, his
    error would have had instant correction.  When the Voivodin had risen
    to her feet, which she did with queenly dignity, the men around
    closed in on the Gospodar like a wave of the sea, and in a second
    held him above their heads, tossing on their lifted hands as if on
    stormy breakers.  It was as though the old Vikings of whom we have
    heard, and whose blood flows in Rupert's veins, were choosing a chief
    in old fashion.  I was myself glad that the men were so taken up with
    the Gospodar that they did not see the glory of the moment in the
    Voivodin's starry eyes; for else they might have guessed the secret.
    I knew from the Vladika's look that he shared my own satisfaction,
    even as he had shared my anxiety.

    As the Gospodar Rupert was tossed high on the lifted hands of the
    mountaineers, their shouts rose to such a sudden volume that around
    us, as far as I could see, the frightened birds rose from the forest,
    and their noisy alarm swelled the tumult.

    The Gospodar, ever thoughtful for others, was the first to calm
    himself.

    "Come, brothers," he said, "let us gain the hilltop, where we can
    signal to the Castle.  It is right that the whole nation should share
    in the glad tidings that the Voivodin Teuta of Vissarion is free.
    But before we go, let us remove the arms and clothing of these
    carrion marauders.  We may have use for them later on."

    The mountaineers set him down, gently enough.  And he, taking the
    Voivodin by the hand, and calling the Vladika and myself close to
    them, led the way up the ravine path which the marauders had
    descended, and thence through the forest to the top of the hill that
    dominated the valley.  Here we could, from an opening amongst the
    trees, catch a glimpse far off of the battlements of Vissarion.
    Forthwith the Gospodar signalled; and on the moment a reply of their
    awaiting was given.  Then the Gospodar signalled the glad news.  It
    was received with manifest rejoicing.  We could not hear any sound so
    far away, but we could see the movement of lifted faces and waving
    hands, and knew that it was well.  But an instant after came a calm
    so dread that we knew before the semaphore had begun to work that
    there was bad news in store for us.  When the news did come, a bitter
    wailing arose amongst us; for the news that was signalled ran:

    "The Voivode has been captured by the Turks on his return, and is
    held by them at Ilsin."

    In an instant the temper of the mountaineers changed.  It was as
    though by a flash summer had changed to winter, as though the yellow
    glory of the standing corn had been obliterated by the dreary waste
    of snow.  Nay, more: it was as when one beholds the track of the
    whirlwind when the giants of the forest are levelled with the sward.
    For a few seconds there was silence; and then, with an angry roar, as
    when God speaks in the thunder, came the fierce determination of the
    men of the Blue Mountains:

    "To Ilsin!  To Ilsin!" and a stampede in the direction of the south
    began.  For, Illustrious Lady, you, perhaps, who have been for so
    short a time at Vissarion, may not know that at the extreme southern
    point of the Land of the Blue Mountains lies the little port of
    Ilsin, which long ago we wrested from the Turk.

    The stampede was checked by the command, "Halt!" spoken in a
    thunderous voice by the Gospodar.  Instinctively all stopped.  The
    Gospodar Rupert spoke again:

    "Had we not better know a little more before we start on our journey?
    I shall get by semaphore what details are known.  Do you all proceed
    in silence and as swiftly as possible.  The Vladika and I will wait
    here till we have received the news and have sent some instructions,
    when we shall follow, and, if we can, overtake you.  One thing: be
    absolutely silent on what has been.  Be secret of every detail--even
    as to the rescue of the Voivodin--except what I send."

    Without a word--thus showing immeasurable trust--the whole body--not
    a very large one, it is true--moved on, and the Gospodar began
    signalling.  As I was myself expert in the code, I did not require
    any explanation, but followed question and answer on either side.
    The first words the Gospodar Rupert signalled were:

    "Silence, absolute and profound, as to everything which has been."
    Then he asked for details of the capture of the Voivode.  The answer
    ran:

    "He was followed from Flushing, and his enemies advised by the spies
    all along the route.  At Ragusa quite a number of
    strangers--travellers seemingly--went on board the packet.  When he
    got out, the strangers debarked too, and evidently followed him,
    though, as yet, we have no details.  He disappeared at Ilsin from the
    Hotel Reo, whither he had gone.  All possible steps are being taken
    to trace his movements, and strictest silence and secrecy are
    observed."

    His answer was:

    "Good!  Keep silent and secret.  Am hurrying back.  Signal request to
    Archbishop and all members of National Council to come to Gadaar with
    all speed.  There the yacht will meet him.  Tell Rooke take yacht all
    speed to Gadaar; there meet Archbishop and Council--give him list of
    names--and return full speed.  Have ready plenty arms, six flying
    artillery.  Two hundred men, provisions three days.  Silence,
    silence.  All depends on that.  All to go on as usual at Castle,
    except to those in secret."

    When the receipt of his message had been signalled, we three--for, of
    course, the Voivodin was with us; she had refused to leave the
    Gospodar--set out hot-foot after our comrades.  But by the time we
    had descended the hill it was evident that the Voivodin could not
    keep up the terrific pace at which we were going.  She struggled
    heroically, but the long journey she had already taken, and the
    hardship and anxiety she had suffered, had told on her.  The Gospodar
    stopped, and said that it would be better that he should press on--it
    was, perhaps, her father's life--and said he would carry her.

    "No, no!" she answered.  "Go on!  I shall follow with the Vladika.
    And then you can have things ready to get on soon after the
    Archbishop and Council arrive."  They kissed each other after, on her
    part, a shy glance at me; and he went on the track of our comrades at
    a great pace.  I could see him shortly after catch them up,--though
    they, too, were going fast.  For a few minutes they ran together, he
    speaking--I could note it from the way they kept turning their heads
    towards him.  Then he broke away from them hurriedly.  He went like a
    stag breaking covert, and was soon out of sight.  They halted a
    moment or two.  Then some few ran on, and all the rest came back
    towards us.  Quickly they improvised a litter with cords and
    branches, and insisted that the Voivodin should use it.  In an
    incredibly short time we were under way again, and proceeding with
    great rapidity towards Vissarion.  The men took it in turns to help
    with the litter; I had the honour of taking a hand in the work
    myself.

    About a third of the way out from Vissarion a number of our people
    met us.  They were fresh, and as they carried the litter, we who were
    relieved were free for speed.  So we soon arrived at the Castle.

    Here we found all humming like a hive of bees.  The yacht, which
    Captain Rooke had kept fired ever since the pursuing party under the
    Gospodar had left Vissarion, was already away, and tearing up the
    coast at a fearful rate.  The rifles and ammunition were stacked on
    the quay.  The field-guns, too, were equipped, and the cases of
    ammunition ready to ship.  The men, two hundred of them, were paraded
    in full kit, ready to start at a moment's notice.  The provision for
    three days was all ready to put aboard, and barrels of fresh water to
    trundle aboard when the yacht should return.  At one end of the quay,
    ready to lift on board, stood also the Gospodar's aeroplane, fully
    equipped, and ready, if need were, for immediate flight.

    I was glad to see that the Voivodin seemed none the worse for her
    terrible experience.  She still wore her shroud; but no one seemed to
    notice it as anything strange.  The whisper had evidently gone round
    of what had been.  But discretion ruled the day.  She and the
    Gospodar met as two who had served and suffered in common; but I was
    glad to notice that both kept themselves under such control that none
    of those not already in the secret even suspected that there was any
    love between them, let alone marriage.

    We all waited with what patience we could till word was signalled
    from the Castle tower that the yacht had appeared over the northern
    horizon, and was coming down fast, keeping inshore as she came.

    When she arrived, we heard to our joy that all concerned had done
    their work well.  The Archbishop was aboard, and of the National
    Council not one was missing.  The Gospodar hurried them all into the
    great hall of the Castle, which had in the meantime been got ready.
    I, too, went with him, but the Voivodin remained without.

    When all were seated, he rose and said:

    "My Lord Archbishop, Vladika, and Lords of the Council all, I have
    dared to summon you in this way because time presses, and the life of
    one you all love--the Voivode Vissarion--is at stake.  This audacious
    attempt of the Turk is the old aggression under a new form.  It is a
    new and more daring step than ever to try to capture your chief and
    his daughter, the Voivodin, whom you love.  Happily, the latter part
    of the scheme is frustrated.  The Voivodin is safe and amongst us.
    But the Voivode is held prisoner--if, indeed, he be still alive.  He
    must be somewhere near Ilsin--but where exactly we know not as yet.
    We have an expedition ready to start the moment we receive your
    sanction--your commands.  We shall obey your wishes with our lives.
    But as the matter is instant, I would venture to ask one question,
    and one only: 'Shall we rescue the Voivode at any cost that may
    present itself?'  I ask this, for the matter has now become an
    international one, and, if our enemies are as earnest as we are, the
    issue is war!"

    Having so spoken, and with a dignity and force which is
    inexpressible, he withdrew; and the Council, having appointed a
    scribe--the monk Cristoferos, whom I had suggested--began its work.

    The Archbishop spoke:

    "Lords of the Council of the Blue Mountains, I venture to ask you
    that the answer to the Gospodar Rupert be an instant 'Yes!' together
    with thanks and honour to that gallant Englisher, who has made our
    cause his own, and who has so valiantly rescued our beloved Voivodin
    from the ruthless hands of our enemies."  Forthwith the oldest member
    of the Council--Nicolos of Volok--rose, and, after throwing a
    searching look round the faces of all, and seeing grave nods of
    assent--for not a word was spoken--said to him who held the door:
    "Summon the Gospodar Rupert forthwith!"  When Rupert entered, he
    spoke to him:

    "Gospodar Rupert, the Council of the Blue Mountains has only one
    answer to give: Proceed!  Rescue the Voivode Vissarion, whatever the
    cost may be!  You hold henceforth in your hand the handjar of our
    nation, as already, for what you have done in your valiant rescue of
    our beloved Voivodin, your breast holds the heart of our people.
    Proceed at once!  We give you, I fear, little time; but we know that
    such is your own wish.  Later, we shall issue formal authorization,
    so that if war may ensue, our allies may understand that you have
    acted for the nation, and also such letters credential as may be
    required by you in this exceptional service.  These shall follow you
    within an hour.  For our enemies we take no account.  See, we draw
    the handjar that we offer you."  As one man all in the hall drew
    their handjars, which flashed as a blaze of lightning.

    There did not seem to be an instant's delay.  The Council broke up,
    and its members, mingling with the people without, took active part
    in the preparations.  Not many minutes had elapsed when the yacht,
    manned and armed and stored as arranged, was rushing out of the
    creek.  On the bridge, beside Captain Rooke, stood the Gospodar
    Rupert and the still-shrouded form of the Voivodin Teuta.  I myself
    was on the lower deck with the soldiers, explaining to certain of
    them the special duties which they might be called on to fulfil.  I
    held the list which the Gospodar Rupert had prepared whilst we were
    waiting for the yacht to arrive from Gadaar.

                                                         PETROF VLASTIMIR.



FROM RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                           _July_ 9, 1907.

We went at a terrific pace down the coast, keeping well inshore so as to
avoid, if possible, being seen from the south.  Just north of Ilsin a
rocky headland juts out, and that was our cover.  On the north of the
peninsula is a small land-locked bay, with deep water.  It is large
enough to take the yacht, though a much larger vessel could not safely
enter.  We ran in, and anchored close to the shore, which has a rocky
frontage--a natural shelf of rock, which is practically the same as a
quay.  Here we met the men who had come from Ilsin and the neighbourhood
in answer to our signalling earlier in the day.  They gave us the latest
information regarding the kidnapping of the Voivode, and informed us that
every man in that section of the country was simply aflame about it.
They assured us that we could rely on them, not merely to fight to the
death, but to keep silence absolutely.  Whilst the seamen, under the
direction of Rooke, took the aeroplane on shore and found a suitable
place for it, where it was hidden from casual view, but from which it
could be easily launched, the Vladika and I--and, of course, my
wife--were hearing such details as were known of the disappearance of her
father.

It seems that he travelled secretly in order to avoid just such a
possibility as has happened.  No one knew of his coming till he came to
Fiume, whence he sent a guarded message to the Archbishop, which the
latter alone would understand.  But this Turkish agents were evidently on
his track all the time, and doubtless the Bureau of Spies was kept well
advised.  He landed at Ilsin from a coasting steamer from Ragusa to the
Levant.

For two days before his coming there had been quite an unusual number of
arrivals at the little port, at which arrivals are rare.  And it turned
out that the little hotel--the only fairly good one in Ilsin--was almost
filled up.  Indeed, only one room was left, which the Voivode took for
the night.  The innkeeper did not know the Voivode in his disguise, but
suspected who it was from the description.  He dined quietly, and went to
bed.  His room was at the back, on the ground-floor, looking out on the
bank of the little River Silva, which here runs into the harbour.  No
disturbance was heard in the night.  Late in the morning, when the
elderly stranger had not made his appearance, inquiry was made at his
door.  He did not answer, so presently the landlord forced the door, and
found the room empty.  His luggage was seemingly intact, only the clothes
which he had worn were gone.  A strange thing was that, though the bed
had been slept in and his clothes were gone, his night-clothes were not
to be found, from which it was argued by the local authorities, when they
came to make inquiry, that he had gone or been taken from the room in his
night-gear, and that his clothes had been taken with him.  There was
evidently some grim suspicion on the part of the authorities, for they
had commanded absolute silence on all in the house.  When they came to
make inquiry as to the other guests, it was found that one and all had
gone in the course of the morning, after paying their bills.  None of
them had any heavy luggage, and there was nothing remaining by which they
might be traced or which would afford any clue to their identity.  The
authorities, having sent a confidential report to the seat of government,
continued their inquiries, and even now all available hands were at work
on the investigation.  When I had signalled to Vissarion, before my
arrival there, word had been sent through the priesthood to enlist in the
investigation the services of all good men, so that every foot of ground
in that section of the Blue Mountains was being investigated.  The
port-master was assured by his watchmen that no vessel, large or small,
had heft the harbour during the night.  The inference, therefore, was
that the Voivode's captors had made inland with him--if, indeed, they
were not already secreted in or near the town.

Whilst we were receiving the various reports, a hurried message came that
it was now believed that the whole party were in the Silent Tower.  This
was a well-chosen place for such an enterprise.  It was a massive tower
of immense strength, built as a memorial--and also as a "keep"--after one
of the massacres of the invading Turks.

It stood on the summit of a rocky knoll some ten miles inland from the
Port of Ilsin.  It was a place shunned as a rule, and the country all
around it was so arid and desolate that there were no residents near it.
As it was kept for state use, and might be serviceable in time of war, it
was closed with massive iron doors, which were kept locked except upon
certain occasions.  The keys were at the seat of government at Plazac.
If, therefore, it had been possible to the Turkish marauders to gain
entrance and exit, it might be a difficult as well as a dangerous task to
try to cut the Voivode out.  His presence with them was a dangerous
menace to any force attacking them, for they would hold his life as a
threat.

I consulted with the Vladika at once as to what was best to be done.  And
we decided that, though we should put a cordon of guards around it at a
safe distance to prevent them receiving warning, we should at present
make no attack.

We made further inquiry as to whether there had been any vessel seen in
the neighbourhood during the past few days, and were informed that once
or twice a warship had been seen on the near side of the southern
horizon.  This was evidently the ship which Rooke had seen on his rush
down the coast after the abduction of the Voivodin, and which he had
identified as a Turkish vessel.  The glimpses of her which had been had
were all in full daylight--there was no proof that she had not stolen up
during the night-time without lights.  But the Vladika and I were
satisfied that the Turkish vessel was watching--was in league with both
parties of marauders--and was intended to take off any of the strangers,
or their prey, who might reach Ilsin undetected.  It was evidently with
this view that the kidnappers of Teuta had, in the first instance, made
with all speed for the south.  It was only when disappointed there that
they headed up north, seeking in desperation for some chance of crossing
the border.  That ring of steel had so far well served its purpose.

I sent for Rooke, and put the matter before him.  He had thought it out
for himself to the same end as we had.  His deduction was:

"Let us keep the cordon, and watch for any signal from the Silent Tower.
The Turks will tire before we shall.  I undertake to watch the Turkish
warship.  During the night I shall run down south, without lights, and
have a look at her, even if I have to wait till the grey of the dawn to
do so.  She may see us; but if she does I shall crawl away at such pace
that she shall not get any idea of our speed.  She will certainly come
nearer before a day is over, for be sure the bureau of spies is kept
advised, and they know that when the country is awake each day increases
the hazard of them and their plans being discovered.  From their caution
I gather that they do not court discovery; and from that that they do not
wish for an open declaration of war.  If this be so, why should we not
come out to them and force an issue if need be?"

When Teuta and I got a chance to be alone, we discussed the situation in
every phase.  The poor girl was in a dreadful state of anxiety regarding
her father's safety.  At first she was hardly able to speak, or even to
think, coherently.  Her utterance was choked, and her reasoning palsied
with indignation.  But presently the fighting blood of her race restored
her faculties, and then her woman's quick wit was worth the reasoning of
a camp full of men.  Seeing that she was all on fire with the subject, I
sat still and waited, taking care not to interrupt her.  For quite a long
time she sat still, whilst the coming night thickened.  When she spoke,
the whole plan of action, based on subtle thinking, had mapped itself out
in her mind:

"We must act quickly.  Every hour increases the risk to my father."  Here
her voice broke for an instant; but she recovered herself and went on:

"If you go to the ship, I must not go with you.  It would not do for me
to be seen.  The Captain doubtless knows of both attempts: that to carry
me off as well as that against my father.  As yet he is in ignorance of
what has happened.  You and your party of brave, loyal men did their work
so well that no news could go forth.  So long, therefore, as the naval
Captain is ignorant, he must delay till the last.  But if he saw me he
would know that _that_ branch of the venture had miscarried.  He would
gather from our being here that we had news of my father's capture, and
as he would know that the marauders would fail unless they were relieved
by force, he would order the captive to be slain."

"Yes, dear, to-morrow you had, perhaps, better see the Captain, but
to-night we must try to rescue my father.  Here I think I see a way.  You
have your aeroplane.  Please take me with you into the Silent Tower."

"Not for a world of chrysolite!" said I, horrified.  She took my hand and
held it tight whilst she went on:

"Dear, I know, I know!  Be satisfied.  But it is the only way.  You can,
I know, get there, and in the dark.  But if you were to go in it, it
would give warning to the enemies, and besides, my father would not
understand.  Remember, he does not know you; he has never seen you, and
does not, I suppose, even know as yet of your existence.  But he would
know me at once, and in any dress.  You can manage to lower me into the
Tower by a rope from the aeroplane.  The Turks as yet do not know of our
pursuit, and doubtless rely, at all events in part, on the strength and
security of the Tower.  Therefore their guard will be less active than it
would at first or later on.  I shall post father in all details, and we
shall be ready quickly.  Now, dear, let us think out the scheme together.
Let your man's wit and experience help my ignorance, and we shall save my
father!"

How could I have resisted such pleading--even had it not seemed wise?
But wise it was; and I, who knew what the aeroplane could do under my own
guidance, saw at once the practicalities of the scheme.  Of course there
was a dreadful risk in case anything should go wrong.  But we are at
present living in a world of risks--and her father's life was at stake.
So I took my dear wife in my arms, and told her that my mind was hers for
this, as my soul and body already were.  And I cheered her by saying that
I thought it might be done.

I sent for Rooke, and told him of the new adventure, and he quite agreed
with me in the wisdom of it.  I then told him that he would have to go
and interview the Captain of the Turkish warship in the morning, if I did
not turn up.  "I am going to see the Vladika," I said.  "He will lead our
own troops in the attack on the Silent Tower.  But it will rest with you
to deal with the warship.  Ask the Captain to whom or what nation the
ship belongs.  He is sure to refuse to tell.  In such case mention to him
that if he flies no nation's flag, his vessel is a pirate ship, and that
you, who are in command of the navy of the Blue Mountains, will deal with
him as a pirate is dealt with--no quarter, no mercy.  He will temporize,
and perhaps try a bluff; but when things get serious with him he will
land a force, or try to, and may even prepare to shell the town.  He will
threaten to, at any rate.  In such case deal with him as you think best,
or as near to it as you can."  He answered:

"I shall carry out your wishes with my life.  It is a righteous task.
Not that anything of that sort would ever stand in my way.  If he attacks
our nation, either as a Turk or a pirate, I shall wipe him out.  We shall
see what our own little packet can do.  Moreover, any of the marauders
who have entered the Blue Mountains, from sea or otherwise, shall never
get out by sea!  I take it that we of my contingent shall cover the
attacking party.  It will be a sorry time for us all if that happens
without our seeing you and the Voivodin; for in such case we shall
understand the worst!"  Iron as he was, the man trembled.

"That is so, Rooke," I said.  "We are taking a desperate chance, we know.
But the case is desperate!  But we all have our duty to do, whatever
happens.  Ours and yours is stern; but when we have done it, the result
will be that life will be easier for others--for those that are left."

Before he left, I asked him to send up to me three suits of the Masterman
bullet-proof clothes of which we had a supply on the yacht.

"Two are for the Voivodin and myself," I said; "the third is for the
Voivode to put on.  The Voivodin will take it with her when she descends
from the aeroplane into the Tower."

Whilst any daylight was left I went out to survey the ground.  My wife
wanted to come with me, but I would not let her.  "No," said I; "you will
have at the best a fearful tax on your strength and your nerves.  You
will want to be as fresh as is possible when you get on the aeroplane."
Like a good wife, she obeyed, and lay down to rest in the little tent
provided for her.

I took with me a local man who knew the ground, and who was trusted to be
silent.  We made a long detour when we had got as near the Silent Tower
as we could without being noticed.  I made notes from my compass as to
directions, and took good notice of anything that could possibly serve as
a landmark.  By the time we got home I was pretty well satisfied that if
all should go well I could easily sail over the Tower in the dark.  Then
I had a talk with my wife, and gave her full instructions:

"When we arrive over the Tower," I said, "I shall lower you with a long
rope.  You will have a parcel of food and spirit for your father in case
he is fatigued or faint; and, of course, the bullet-proof suit, which he
must put on at once.  You will also have a short rope with a belt at
either end--one for your father, the other for you.  When I turn the
aeroplane and come back again, you will have ready the ring which lies
midway between the belts.  This you will catch into the hook at the end
of the lowered rope.  When all is secure, and I have pulled you both up
by the windlass so as to clear the top, I shall throw out ballast which
we shall carry on purpose, and away we go!  I am sorry it must be so
uncomfortable for you both, but there is no other way.  When we get well
clear of the Tower, I shall take you both up on the platform.  If
necessary, I shall descend to do it--and then we shall steer for Ilsin."

"When all is safe, our men will attack the Tower.  We must let them do
it, for they expect it.  A few men in the clothes and arms which we took
from your captors will be pursued by some of ours.  It is all arranged.
They will ask the Turks to admit them, and if the latter have not learned
of your father's escape, perhaps they will do so.  Once in, our men will
try to open the gate.  The chances are against them, poor fellows! but
they are all volunteers, and will die fighting.  If they win out, great
glory will be theirs."

"The moon does not rise to-night till just before midnight, so we have
plenty of time.  We shall start from here at ten.  If all be well, I
shall place you in the Tower with your father in less than a quarter-hour
from that.  A few minutes will suffice to clothe him in bullet-proof and
get on his belt.  I shall not be away from the Tower more than a very few
minutes, and, please God, long before eleven we shall be safe.  Then the
Tower can be won in an attack by our mountaineers.  Perhaps, when the
guns are heard on the ship of war--for there is sure to be firing--the
Captain may try to land a shore party.  But Rooke will stand in the way,
and if I know the man and _The Lady_, we shall not be troubled with many
Turks to-night.  By midnight you and your father can be on the way to
Vissarion.  I can interview the naval Captain in the morning."

My wife's marvellous courage and self-possession stood to her.  At half
an hour before the time fixed she was ready for our adventure.  She had
improved the scheme in one detail.  She had put on her own belt and
coiled the rope round her waist, so the only delay would be in bringing
her father's belt.  She would keep the bullet-proof dress intended to be
his strapped in a packet on her back, so that if occasion should be
favourable he would not want to put it on till he and she should have
reached the platform of the aeroplane.  In such case, I should not steer
away from the Tower at all, but would pass slowly across it and take up
the captive and his brave daughter before leaving.  I had learned from
local sources that the Tower was in several stories.  Entrance was by the
foot, where the great iron-clad door was; then came living-rooms and
storage, and an open space at the top.  This would probably be thought
the best place for the prisoner, for it was deep-sunk within the massive
walls, wherein was no loophole of any kind.  This, if it should so
happen, would be the disposition of things best for our plan.  The guards
would at this time be all inside the Tower--probably resting, most of
them--so that it was possible that no one might notice the coming of the
airship.  I was afraid to think that all might turn out so well, for in
such case our task would be a simple enough one, and would in all human
probability be crowned with success.

At ten o'clock we started.  Teuta did not show the smallest sign of fear
or even uneasiness, though this was the first time she had even seen an
aeroplane at work.  She proved to be an admirable passenger for an
airship.  She stayed quite still, holding herself rigidly in the position
arranged, by the cords which I had fixed for her.

When I had trued my course by the landmarks and with the compass lit by
the Tiny my electric light in the dark box, I had time to look about me.
All seemed quite dark wherever I looked--to land, or sea, or sky.  But
darkness is relative, and though each quarter and spot looked dark in
turn, there was not such absolute darkness as a whole.  I could tell the
difference, for instance, between land and sea, no matter how far off we
might be from either.  Looking upward, the sky was dark; yet there was
light enough to see, and even distinguish broad effects.  I had no
difficulty in distinguishing the Tower towards which we were moving, and
that, after all, was the main thing.  We drifted slowly, very slowly, as
the air was still, and I only used the minimum pressure necessary for the
engine.  I think I now understood for the first time the extraordinary
value of the engine with which my Kitson was equipped.  It was noiseless,
it was practically of no weight, and it allowed the machine to progress
as easily as the old-fashioned balloon used to drift before a breeze.
Teuta, who had naturally very fine sight, seemed to see even better than
I did, for as we drew nearer to the Tower, and its round, open top began
to articulate itself, she commenced to prepare for her part of the task.
She it was who uncoiled the long drag-rope ready for her lowering.  We
were proceeding so gently that she as well as I had hopes that I might be
able to actually balance the machine on the top of the curving wall--a
thing manifestly impossible on a straight surface, though it might have
been possible on an angle.

On we crept--on, and on!  There was no sign of light about the Tower, and
not the faintest sound to be heard till we were almost close to the line
of the rising wall; then we heard a sound of something like mirth, but
muffled by distance and thick walls.  From it we took fresh heart, for it
told us that our enemies were gathered in the lower chambers.  If only
the Voivode should be on the upper stage, all would be well.

Slowly, almost inch by inch, and with a suspense that was agonizing, we
crossed some twenty or thirty feet above the top of the wall.  I could
see as we came near the jagged line of white patches where the heads of
the massacred Turks placed there on spikes in old days seemed to give
still their grim warning.  Seeing that they made in themselves a
difficulty of landing on the wall, I deflected the plane so that, as we
crept over the wall, we might, if they became displaced, brush them to
the outside of the wall.  A few seconds more, and I was able to bring the
machine to rest with the front of the platform jutting out beyond the
Tower wall.  Here I anchored her fore and aft with clamps which had been
already prepared.

Whilst I was doing so Teuta had leaned over the inner edge of the
platform, and whispered as softly as the sigh of a gentle breeze:

"Hist! hist!"  The answer came in a similar sound from some twenty feet
below us, and we knew that the prisoner was alone.  Forthwith, having
fixed the hook of the rope in the ring to which was attached her belt, I
lowered my wife.  Her father evidently knew her whisper, and was ready.
The hollow Tower--a smooth cylinder within--sent up the voices from it
faint as were the whispers:

"Father, it is I--Teuta!"

"My child, my brave daughter!"

"Quick, father; strap the belt round you.  See that it is secure.  We
have to be lifted into the air if necessary.  Hold together.  It will be
easier for Rupert to lift us to the airship."

"Rupert?"

"Yes; I shall explain later.  Quick, quick!  There is not a moment to
lose.  He is enormously strong, and can lift us together; but we must
help him by being still, so he won't have to use the windlass, which
might creak."  As she spoke she jerked slightly at the rope, which was
our preconcerted signal that I was to lift.  I was afraid the windlass
might creak, and her thoughtful hint decided me.  I bent my back to the
task, and in a few seconds they were on the platform on which they, at
Teuta's suggestion, lay flat, one at each side of my seat, so as to keep
the best balance possible.

I took off the clamps, lifted the bags of ballast to the top of the wall,
so that there should be no sound of falling, and started the engine.  The
machine moved forward a few inches, so that it tilted towards the outside
of the wall.  I threw my weight on the front part of the platform, and we
commenced our downward fall at a sharp angle.  A second enlarged the
angle, and without further ado we slid away into the darkness.  Then,
ascending as we went, when the engine began to work at its strength, we
turned, and presently made straight for Ilsin.

The journey was short--not many minutes.  It almost seemed as if no time
whatever had elapsed till we saw below us the gleam of lights, and by
them saw a great body of men gathered in military array.  We slackened
and descended.  The crowd kept deathly silence, but when we were amongst
them we needed no telling that it was not due to lack of heart or absence
of joy.  The pressure of their hands as they surrounded us, and the
devotion with which they kissed the hands and feet of both the Voivode
and his daughter, were evidence enough for me, even had I not had my own
share of their grateful rejoicing.

In the midst of it all the low, stern voice of Rooke, who had burst a way
to the front beside the Vladika, said:

"Now is the time to attack the Tower.  Forward, brothers, but in silence.
Let there not be a sound till you are near the gate; then play your
little comedy of the escaping marauders.  And 'twill be no comedy for
them in the Tower.  The yacht is all ready for the morning, Mr. Sent
Leger, in case I do not come out of the scrimmage if the bluejackets
arrive.  In such case you will have to handle her yourself.  God keep
you, my Lady; and you, too, Voivode!  Forward!"

In a ghostly silence the grim little army moved forwards.  Rooke and the
men with him disappeared into the darkness in the direction of the
harbour of Ilsin.



FROM THE SCRIPT OF THE VOIVODE, PETER VISSARION,


                                                           _July_ 7, 1907.

I had little idea, when I started on my homeward journey, that it would
have such a strange termination.  Even I, who ever since my boyhood have
lived in a whirl of adventure, intrigue, or diplomacy--whichever it may
be called--statecraft, and war, had reason to be surprised.  I certainly
thought that when I locked myself into my room in the hotel at Ilsin that
I would have at last a spell, however short, of quiet.  All the time of
my prolonged negotiations with the various nationalities I had to be at
tension; so, too, on my homeward journey, lest something at the last
moment should happen adversely to my mission.  But when I was safe on my
own Land of the Blue Mountains, and laid my head on my pillow, where only
friends could be around me, I thought I might forget care.

But to wake with a rude hand over my mouth, and to feel myself grasped
tight by so many hands that I could not move a limb, was a dreadful
shock.  All after that was like a dreadful dream.  I was rolled in a
great rug so tightly that I could hardly breathe, let alone cry out.
Lifted by many hands through the window, which I could hear was softly
opened and shut for the purpose, and carried to a boat.  Again lifted
into some sort of litter, on which I was borne a long distance, but with
considerable rapidity.  Again lifted out and dragged through a doorway
opened on purpose--I could hear the clang as it was shut behind me.  Then
the rug was removed, and I found myself, still in my night-gear, in the
midst of a ring of men.  There were two score of them, all Turks, all
strong-looking, resolute men, armed to the teeth.  My clothes, which had
been taken from my room, were thrown down beside me, and I was told to
dress.  As the Turks were going from the room--shaped like a vault--where
we then were, the last of them, who seemed to be some sort of officer,
said:

"If you cry out or make any noise whatever whilst you are in this Tower,
you shall die before your time!"  Presently some food and water were
brought me, and a couple of blankets.  I wrapped myself up and slept till
early in the morning.  Breakfast was brought, and the same men filed in.
In the presence of them all the same officer said:

"I have given instructions that if you make any noise or betray your
presence to anyone outside this Tower, the nearest man is to restore you
to immediate quiet with his yataghan.  It you promise me that you will
remain quiet whilst you are within the Tower, I can enlarge your
liberties somewhat.  Do you promise?"  I promised as he wished; there was
no need to make necessary any stricter measure of confinement.  Any
chance of escape lay in having the utmost freedom allowed to me.
Although I had been taken away with such secrecy, I knew that before long
there would be pursuit.  So I waited with what patience I could.  I was
allowed to go on the upper platform--a consideration due, I am convinced,
to my captors' wish for their own comfort rather than for mine.

It was not very cheering, for during the daytime I had satisfied myself
that it would be quite impossible for even a younger and more active man
than I am to climb the walls.  They were built for prison purposes, and a
cat could not find entry for its claws between the stones.  I resigned
myself to my fate as well as I could.  Wrapping my blanket round me, I
lay down and looked up at the sky.  I wished to see it whilst I could.  I
was just dropping to sleep--the unutterable silence of the place broken
only now and again by some remark by my captors in the rooms below
me--when there was a strange appearance just over me--an appearance so
strange that I sat up, and gazed with distended eyes.

Across the top of the tower, some height above, drifted, slowly and
silently, a great platform.  Although the night was dark, it was so much
darker where I was within the hollow of the Tower that I could actually
see what was above me.  I knew it was an aeroplane--one of which I had
seen in Washington.  A man was seated in the centre, steering; and beside
him was a silent figure of a woman all wrapped in white.  It made my
heart beat to see her, for she was figured something like my Teuta, but
broader, less shapely.  She leaned over, and a whispered "Ssh!" crept
down to me.  I answered in similar way.  Whereupon she rose, and the man
lowered her down into the Tower.  Then I saw that it was my dear daughter
who had come in this wonderful way to save me.  With infinite haste she
helped me to fasten round my waist a belt attached to a rope, which was
coiled round her; and then the man, who was a giant in strength as well
as stature, raised us both to the platform of the aeroplane, which he set
in motion without an instant's delay.

Within a few seconds, and without any discovery being made of my escape,
we were speeding towards the sea.  The lights of Ilsin were in front of
us.  Before reaching the town, however, we descended in the midst of a
little army of my own people, who were gathered ready to advance upon the
Silent Tower, there to effect, if necessary, my rescue by force.  Small
chance would there have been of my life in case of such a struggle.
Happily, however, the devotion and courage of my dear daughter and of her
gallant companion prevented such a necessity.  It was strange to me to
find such joyous reception amongst my friends expressed in such a
whispered silence.  There was no time for comment or understanding or the
asking of questions--I was fain to take things as they stood, and wait
for fuller explanation.

This came later, when my daughter and I were able to converse alone.

When the expedition went out against the Silent Tower, Teuta and I went
to her tent, and with us came her gigantic companion, who seemed not
wearied, but almost overcome with sleep.  When we came into the tent,
over which at a little distance a cordon of our mountaineers stood on
guard, he said to me:

"May I ask you, sir, to pardon me for a time, and allow the Voivodin to
explain matters to you?  She will, I know, so far assist me, for there is
so much work still to be done before we are free of the present peril.
For myself, I am almost overcome with sleep.  For three nights I have had
no sleep, but all during that time much labour and more anxiety.  I could
hold on longer; but at daybreak I must go out to the Turkish warship that
lies in the offing.  She is a Turk, though she does not confess to it;
and she it is who has brought hither the marauders who captured both your
daughter and yourself.  It is needful that I go, for I hold a personal
authority from the National Council to take whatever step may be
necessary for our protection.  And when I go I should be clear-headed,
for war may rest on that meeting.  I shall be in the adjoining tent, and
shall come at once if I am summoned, in case you wish for me before
dawn."  Here my daughter struck in:

"Father, ask him to remain here.  We shall not disturb him, I am sure, in
our talking.  And, moreover, if you knew how much I owe to him--to his
own bravery and his strength--you would understand how much safer I feel
when he is close to me, though we are surrounded by an army of our brave
mountaineers."

"But, my daughter," I said, for I was as yet all in ignorance, "there are
confidences between father and daughter which none other may share.  Some
of what has been I know, but I want to know all, and it might be better
that no stranger--however valiant he may be, or no matter in what measure
we are bound to him--should be present."  To my astonishment, she who had
always been amenable to my lightest wish actually argued with me:

"Father, there are other confidences which have to be respected in like
wise.  Bear with me, dear, till I have told you all, and I am right sure
that you will agree with me.  I ask it, father."

That settled the matter, and as I could see that the gallant gentleman
who had rescued me was swaying on his feet as he waited respectfully, I
said to him:

"Rest with us, sir.  We shall watch over your sleep."

Then I had to help him, for almost on the instant he sank down, and I had
to guide him to the rugs spread on the ground.  In a few seconds he was
in a deep sleep.  As I stood looking at him, till I had realized that he
vas really asleep, I could not help marvelling at the bounty of Nature
that could uphold even such a man as this to the last moment of work to
be done, and then allow so swift a collapse when all was over, and he
could rest peacefully.

He was certainly a splendid fellow.  I think I never saw so fine a man
physically in my life.  And if the lesson of his physiognomy be true, he
is as sterling inwardly as his external is fair.  "Now," said I to Teuta,
"we are to all intents quite alone.  Tell me all that has been, so that I
may understand."

Whereupon my daughter, making me sit down, knelt beside me, and told me
from end to end the most marvellous story I had ever heard or read of.
Something of it I had already known from the Archbishop Paleologue's
later letters, but of all else I was ignorant.  Far away in the great
West beyond the Atlantic, and again on the fringe of the Eastern seas, I
had been thrilled to my heart's core by the heroic devotion and fortitude
of my daughter in yielding herself for her country's sake to that fearful
ordeal of the Crypt; of the grief of the nation at her reported death,
news of which was so mercifully and wisely withheld from me as long as
possible; of the supernatural rumours that took root so deep; but no word
or hint had come to me of a man who had come across the orbit of her
life, much less of all that has resulted from it.  Neither had I known of
her being carried off, or of the thrice gallant rescue of her by Rupert.
Little wonder that I thought so highly of him even at the first moment I
had a clear view of him when he sank down to sleep before me.  Why, the
man must be a marvel.  Even our mountaineers could not match such
endurance as his.  In the course of her narrative my daughter told me of
how, being wearied with her long waiting in the tomb, and waking to find
herself alone when the floods were out, and even the Crypt submerged, she
sought safety and warmth elsewhere; and how she came to the Castle in the
night, and found the strange man alone.  I said: "That was dangerous,
daughter, if not wrong.  The man, brave and devoted as he is, must answer
me--your father."  At that she was greatly upset, and before going on
with her narrative, drew me close in her arms, and whispered to me:

"Be gentle to me, father, for I have had much to bear.  And be good to
him, for he holds my heart in his breast!"  I reassured her with a gentle
pressure--there was no need to speak.  She then went on to tell me about
her marriage, and how her husband, who had fallen into the belief that
she was a Vampire, had determined to give even his soul for her; and how
she had on the night of the marriage left him and gone back to the tomb
to play to the end the grim comedy which she had undertaken to perform
till my return; and how, on the second night after her marriage, as she
was in the garden of the Castle--going, as she shyly told me, to see if
all was well with her husband--she was seized secretly, muffled up,
bound, and carried off.  Here she made a pause and a digression.
Evidently some fear lest her husband and myself should quarrel assailed
her, for she said:

"Do understand, father, that Rupert's marriage to me was in all ways
regular, and quite in accord with our customs.  Before we were married I
told the Archbishop of my wish.  He, as your representative during your
absence, consented himself, and brought the matter to the notice of the
Vladika and the Archimandrites.  All these concurred, having exacted from
me--very properly, I think--a sacred promise to adhere to my
self-appointed task.  The marriage itself was orthodox in all
ways--though so far unusual that it was held at night, and in darkness,
save for the lights appointed by the ritual.  As to that, the Archbishop
himself, or the Archimandrite of Spazac, who assisted him, or the
Vladika, who acted as Paranymph, will, all or any of them, give you full
details.  Your representative made all inquiries as to Rupert Sent Leger,
who lived in Vissarion, though he did not know who I was, or from his
point of view who I had been.  But I must tell you of my rescue."

And so she went on to tell me of that unavailing journey south by her
captors; of their bafflement by the cordon which Rupert had established
at the first word of danger to "the daughter of our leader," though he
little knew who the "leader" was, or who was his "daughter"; of how the
brutal marauders tortured her to speed with their daggers; and how her
wounds left blood-marks on the ground as she passed along; then of the
halt in the valley, when the marauders came to know that their road north
was menaced, if not already blocked; of the choosing of the murderers,
and their keeping ward over her whilst their companions went to survey
the situation; and of her gallant rescue by that noble fellow, her
husband--my son I shall call him henceforth, and thank God that I may
have that happiness and that honour!

Then my daughter went on to tell me of the race back to Vissarion, when
Rupert went ahead of all--as a leader should do; of the summoning of the
Archbishop and the National Council; and of their placing the nation's
handjar in Rupert's hand; of the journey to Ilsin, and the flight of my
daughter--and my son--on the aeroplane.

The rest I knew.

As she finished, the sleeping man stirred and woke--broad awake in a
second--sure sign of a man accustomed to campaign and adventure.  At a
glance he recalled everything that had been, and sprang to his feet.  He
stood respectfully before me for a few seconds before speaking.  Then he
said, with an open, engaging smile:

"I see, sir, you know all.  Am I forgiven--for Teuta's sake as well as my
own?"  By this time I was also on my feet.  A man like that walks
straight into my heart.  My daughter, too, had risen, and stood by my
side.  I put out my hand and grasped his, which seemed to leap to meet
me--as only the hand of a swordsman can do.

"I am glad you are my son!" I said.  It was all I could say, and I meant
it and all it implied.  We shook hands warmly.  Teuta was pleased; she
kissed me, and then stood holding my arm with one hand, whilst she linked
her other hand in the arm of her husband.

He summoned one of the sentries without, and told him to ask Captain
Rooke to come to him.  The latter had been ready for a call, and came at
once.  When through the open flap of the tent we saw him coming,
Rupert--as I must call him now, because Teuta wishes it; and I like to do
it myself--said:

"I must be off to board the Turkish vessel before it comes inshore.
Good-bye, sir, in case we do not meet again."  He said the last few words
in so low a voice that I only could hear them.  Then he kissed his wife,
and told her he expected to be back in time for breakfast, and was gone.
He met Rooke--I am hardly accustomed to call him Captain as yet, though,
indeed, he well deserves it--at the edge of the cordon of sentries, and
they went quickly together towards the port, where the yacht was lying
with steam up.




BOOK VII: THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR


FROM THE REPORT OF CRISTOFEROS, WAR-SCRIBE TO THE NATIONAL COUNCIL.


                                                           _July_ 7, 1907.

When the Gospodar Rupert and Captain Rooke came within hailing distance
of the strange ship, the former hailed her, using one after another the
languages of England, Germany, France, Russia, Turkey, Greece, Spain,
Portugal, and another which I did not know; I think it must have been
American.  By this time the whole line of the bulwark was covered by a
row of Turkish faces.  When, in Turkish, the Gospodar asked for the
Captain, the latter came to the gangway, which had been opened, and stood
there.  His uniform was that of the Turkish navy--of that I am prepared
to swear--but he made signs of not understanding what had been said;
whereupon the Gospodar spoke again, but in French this time.  I append
the exact conversation which took place, none other joining in it.  I
took down in shorthand the words of both as they were spoken:

THE GOSPODAR.  "Are you the Captain of this ship?"

THE CAPTAIN.  "I am."

GOSPODAR.  "To what nationality do you belong?"

CAPTAIN.  "It matters not.  I am Captain of this ship."

GOSPODAR.  "I alluded to your ship.  What national flag is she under?"

CAPTAIN (_throwing his eye over the top-hamper_).  "I do not see that any
flag is flying."

GOSPODAR.  "I take it that, as commander, you can allow me on board with
my two companions?"

CAPTAIN.  "I can, upon proper request being made!"

GOSPODAR (_taking off his cap_).  "I ask your courtesy, Captain.  I am
the representative and accredited officer of the National Council of the
Land of the Blue Mountains, in whose waters you now are; and on their
account I ask for a formal interview on urgent matters."

The Turk, who was, I am bound to say, in manner most courteous as yet,
gave some command to his officers, whereupon the companion-ladders and
stage were lowered and the gangway manned, as is usual for the reception
on a ship of war of an honoured guest.

CAPTAIN.  "You are welcome, sir--you and your two companions--as you
request."

The Gospodar bowed.  Our companion-ladder was rigged on the instant, and
a launch lowered.  The Gospodar and Captain Rooke--taking me with
them--entered, and rowed to the warship, where we were all honourably
received.  There were an immense number of men on board, soldiers as well
as seamen.  It looked more like a warlike expedition than a fighting-ship
in time of peace.  As we stepped on the deck, the seamen and marines, who
were all armed as at drill, presented arms.  The Gospodar went first
towards the Captain, and Captain Rooke and I followed close behind him.
The Gospodar spoke:

"I am Rupert Sent Leger, a subject of his Britannic Majesty, presently
residing at Vissarion, in the Land of the Blue Mountains.  I am at
present empowered to act for the National Council in all matters.  Here
is my credential!"  As he spoke he handed to the Captain a letter.  It
was written in five different languages--Balkan, Turkish, Greek, English,
and French.  The Captain read it carefully all through, forgetful for the
moment that he had seemingly been unable to understand the Gospodar's
question spoken in the Turkish tongue.  Then he answered:

"I see the document is complete.  May I ask on what subject you wish to
see me?"

GOSPODAR.  "You are here in a ship of war in Blue Mountain waters, yet
you fly no flag of any nation.  You have sent armed men ashore in your
boats, thus committing an act of war.  The National Council of the Land
of the Blue Mountains requires to know what nation you serve, and why the
obligations of international law are thus broken."

The Captain seemed to wait for further speech, but the Gospodar remained
silent; whereupon the former spoke.

CAPTAIN.  "I am responsible to my own--chiefs.  I refuse to answer your
question."

The Gospodar spoke at once in reply.

GOSPODAR.  "Then, sir, you, as commander of a ship--and especially a ship
of war--must know that in thus violating national and maritime laws you,
and all on board this ship, are guilty of an act of piracy.  This is not
even piracy on the high seas.  You are not merely within territorial
waters, but you have invaded a national port.  As you refuse to disclose
the nationality of your ship, I accept, as you seem to do, your status as
that of a pirate, and shall in due season act accordingly."

CAPTAIN (_with manifest hostility_).  "I accept the responsibility of my
own acts.  Without admitting your contention, I tell you now that
whatever action you take shall be at your own peril and that of your
National Council.  Moreover, I have reason to believe that my men who
were sent ashore on special service have been beleaguered in a tower
which can be seen from the ship.  Before dawn this morning firing was
heard from that direction, from which I gather that attack was made on
them.  They, being only a small party, may have been murdered.  If such
be so, I tell you that you and your miserable little nation, as you call
it, shall pay such blood-money as you never thought of.  I am responsible
for this, and, by Allah! there shall be a great revenge.  You have not in
all your navy--if navy you have at all--power to cope with even one ship
like this, which is but one of many.  My guns shall be trained on Ilsin,
to which end I have come inshore.  You and your companions have free
conduct back to port; such is due to the white flag which you fly.
Fifteen minutes will bring you back whence you came.  Go!  And remember
that whatever you may do amongst your mountain defiles, at sea you cannot
even defend yourselves."

GOSPODAR (_slowly and in a ringing voice_).  "The Land of the Blue
Mountains has its own defences on sea and land.  Its people know how to
defend themselves."

CAPTAIN (_taking out his watch_).  "It is now close on five bells.  At
the first stroke of six bells our guns shall open fire."

GOSPODAR (_calmly_).  "It is my last duty to warn you, sir--and to warn
all on this ship--that much may happen before even the first stroke of
six bells.  Be warned in time, and give over this piratical attack, the
very threat of which may be the cause of much bloodshed."

CAPTAIN (_violently_).  "Do you dare to threaten me, and, moreover, my
ship's company?  We are one, I tell you, in this ship; and the last man
shall perish like the first ere this enterprise fail.  Go!"

With a bow, the Gospodar turned and went down the ladder, we following
him.  In a couple of minutes the yacht was on her way to the port.



FROM RUPERT'S JOURNAL.


                                                          _July_ 10, 1907.

When we turned shoreward after my stormy interview with the pirate
Captain--I can call him nothing else at present, Rooke gave orders to a
quartermaster on the bridge, and _The Lady_ began to make to a little
northward of Ilsin port.  Rooke himself went aft to the wheel-house,
taking several men with him.

When we were quite near the rocks--the water is so deep here that there
is no danger--we slowed down, merely drifting along southwards towards
the port.  I was myself on the bridge, and could see all over the decks.
I could also see preparations going on upon the warship.  Ports were
opened, and the great guns on the turrets were lowered for action.  When
we were starboard broadside on to the warship, I saw the port side of the
steering-house open, and Rooke's men sliding out what looked like a huge
grey crab, which by tackle from within the wheel-house was lowered softly
into the sea.  The position of the yacht hid the operation from sight of
the warship.   The doors were shut again, and the yacht's pace began to
quicken.  We ran into the port.  I had a vague idea that Rooke had some
desperate project on hand.  Not for nothing had he kept the wheel-house
locked on that mysterious crab.

All along the frontage was a great crowd of eager men.  But they had
considerately left the little mole at the southern entrance, whereon was
a little tower, on whose round top a signal-gun was placed, free for my
own use.  When I was landed on this pier I went along to the end, and,
climbing the narrow stair within, went out on the sloping roof.  I stood
up, for I was determined to show the Turks that I was not afraid for
myself, as they would understand when the bombardment should begin.  It
was now but a very few minutes before the fatal hour--six bells.  But all
the same I was almost in a state of despair.  It was terrible to think of
all those poor souls in the town who had done nothing wrong, and who were
to be wiped out in the coming blood-thirsty, wanton attack.  I raised my
glasses to see how preparations were going on upon the warship.

As I looked I had a momentary fear that my eyesight was giving way.  At
one moment I had the deck of the warship focussed with my glasses, and
could see every detail as the gunners waited for the word to begin the
bombardment with the great guns of the barbettes.  The next I saw nothing
but the empty sea.  Then in another instant there was the ship as before,
but the details were blurred.  I steadied myself against the signal-gun,
and looked again.  Not more than two, or at the most three, seconds had
elapsed.  The ship was, for the moment, full in view.  As I looked, she
gave a queer kind of quick shiver, prow and stern, and then sideways.  It
was for all the world like a rat shaken in the mouth of a skilled
terrier.  Then she remained still, the one placid thing to be seen, for
all around her the sea seemed to shiver in little independent eddies, as
when water is broken without a current to guide it.

I continued to look, and when the deck was, or seemed, quite still--for
the shivering water round the ship kept catching my eyes through the
outer rays of the lenses--I noticed that nothing was stirring.  The men
who had been at the guns were all lying down; the men in the
fighting-tops had leaned forward or backward, and their arms hung down
helplessly.  Everywhere was desolation--in so far as life was concerned.
Even a little brown bear, which had been seated on the cannon which was
being put into range position, had jumped or fallen on deck, and lay
there stretched out--and still.  It was evident that some terrible shock
had been given to the mighty war-vessel.  Without a doubt or a thought
why I did so, I turned my eyes towards where _The Lady_ lay, port
broadside now to the inside, in the harbour mouth.  I had the key now to
the mystery of Rooke's proceedings with the great grey crab.

As I looked I saw just outside the harbour a thin line of cleaving water.
This became more marked each instant, till a steel disc with glass eyes
that shone in the light of the sun rose above the water.  It was about
the size of a beehive, and was shaped like one.  It made a straight line
for the aft of the yacht.  At the same moment, in obedience to some
command, given so quietly that I did not hear it, the men went below--all
save some few, who began to open out doors in the port side of the
wheel-house.  The tackle was run out through an opened gangway on that
side, and a man stood on the great hook at the lower end, balancing
himself by hanging on the chain.  In a few seconds he came up again.  The
chain tightened and the great grey crab rose over the edge of the deck,
and was drawn into the wheel-house, the doors of which were closed,
shutting in a few only of the men.

I waited, quite quiet.  After a space of a few minutes, Captain Rooke in
his uniform walked out of the wheel-house.  He entered a small boat,
which had been in the meantime lowered for the purpose, and was rowed to
the steps on the mole.  Ascending these, he came directly towards the
signal-tower.  When he had ascended and stood beside me, he saluted.

"Well?" I asked.

"All well, sir," he answered.  "We shan't have any more trouble with that
lot, I think.  You warned that pirate--I wish he had been in truth a
clean, honest, straightforward pirate, instead of the measly Turkish swab
he was--that something might occur before the first stroke of six bells.
Well, something has occurred, and for him and all his crew that six bells
will never sound.  So the Lord fights for the Cross against the Crescent!
Bismillah.  Amen!"  He said this in a manifestly formal way, as though
declaiming a ritual.  The next instant he went on in the thoroughly
practical conventional way which was usual to him:

"May I ask a favour, Mr. Sent Leger?"

"A thousand, my dear Rooke," I said.  "You can't ask me anything which I
shall not freely grant.  And I speak within my brief from the National
Council.  You have saved Ilsin this day, and the Council will thank you
for it in due time."

"Me, sir?" he said, with a look of surprise on his face which seemed
quite genuine.  "If you think that, I am well out of it.  I was afraid,
when I woke, that you might court-martial me!"

"Court-martial you!  What for?" I asked, surprised in my turn.

"For going to sleep on duty, sir!  And the fact is, I was worn out in the
attack on the Silent Tower last night, and when you had your interview
with the pirate--all good pirates forgive me for the blasphemy!
Amen!--and I knew that everything was going smoothly, I went into the
wheel-house and took forty winks."  He said all this without moving so
much as an eyelid, from which I gathered that he wished absolute silence
to be observed on my part.  Whilst I was revolving this in my mind he
went on:

"Touching that request, sir.  When I have left you and the Voivode--and
the Voivodin, of course--at Vissarion, together with such others as you
may choose to bring there with you, may I bring the yacht back here for a
spell?  I rather think that there is a good deal of cleaning up to be
done, and the crew of _The Lady_ with myself are the men to do it.  We
shall be back by nightfall at the creek."

"Do as you think best, Admiral Rooke," I said.

"Admiral?"

"Yes, Admiral.  At present I can only say that tentatively, but by
to-morrow I am sure the National Council will have confirmed it.  I am
afraid, old friend, that your squadron will be only your flagship for the
present; but later we may do better."

"So long as I am Admiral, your honour, I shall have no other flagship
than _The Lady_.  I am not a young man, but, young or old, my pennon
shall float over no other deck.  Now, one other favour, Mr. Sent Leger?
It is a corollary of the first, so I do not hesitate to ask.  May I
appoint Lieutenant Desmond, my present First Officer, to the command of
the battleship?  Of course, he will at first only command the prize crew;
but in such case he will fairly expect the confirmation of his rank
later.  I had better, perhaps, tell you, sir, that he is a very capable
seaman, learned in all the sciences that pertain to a battleship, and
bred in the first navy in the world."

"By all means, Admiral.  Your nomination shall, I think I may promise
you, be confirmed."

Not another word we spoke.  I returned with him in his boat to _The
Lady_, which was brought to the dock wall, where we were received with
tumultuous cheering.

I hurried off to my Wife and the Voivode.  Rooke, calling Desmond to him,
went on the bridge of _The Lady_, which turned, and went out at terrific
speed to the battleship, which was already drifting up northward on the
tide.



FROM THE REPORT OF CRISTOFEROS, SCRIBE OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE
LAND OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS.


                                                           _July_ 8, 1907.

The meeting of the National Council, July 6, was but a continuation of
that held before the rescue of the Voivodin Vissarion, the members of the
Council having been during the intervening night housed in the Castle of
Vissarion.   When, in the early morning, they met, all were jubilant; for
late at night the fire-signal had flamed up from Ilsin with the glad news
that the Voivode Peter Vissarion was safe, having been rescued with great
daring on an aeroplane by his daughter and the Gospodar Rupert, as the
people call him--Mister Rupert Sent Leger, as he is in his British name
and degree.

Whilst the Council was sitting, word came that a great peril to the town
of Ilsin had been averted.  A war-vessel acknowledging to no nationality,
and therefore to be deemed a pirate, had threatened to bombard the town;
but just before the time fixed for the fulfilment of her threat, she was
shaken to such an extent by some sub-aqueous means that, though she
herself was seemingly uninjured, nothing was left alive on board.  Thus
the Lord preserves His own!  The consideration of this, as well as the
other incident, was postponed until the coming Voivode and the Gospodar
Rupert, together with who were already on their way hither.



THE SAME (LATER IN THE SAME DAY).


The Council resumed its sitting at four o'clock.  The Voivode Peter
Vissarion and the Voivodin Teuta had arrived with the "Gospodar Rupert,"
as the mountaineers call him (Mr. Rupert Sent Leger) on the armoured
yacht he calls _The Lady_.  The National Council showed great pleasure
when the Voivode entered the hall in which the Council met.  He seemed
much gratified by the reception given to him.  Mr. Rupert Sent Leger, by
the express desire of the Council, was asked to be present at the
meeting.  He took a seat at the bottom of the hall, and seemed to prefer
to remain there, though asked by the President of the Council to sit at
the top of the table with himself and the Voivode.

When the formalities of such Councils had been completed, the Voivode
handed to the President a memorandum of his report on his secret mission
to foreign Courts on behalf of the National Council.  He then explained
at length, for the benefit of the various members of the Council, the
broad results of his mission.  The result was, he said, absolutely
satisfactory.  Everywhere he had been received with distinguished
courtesy, and given a sympathetic hearing.  Several of the Powers
consulted had made delay in giving final answers, but this, he explained,
was necessarily due to new considerations arising from the international
complications which were universally dealt with throughout the world as
"the Balkan Crisis."  In time, however (the Voivode went on), these
matters became so far declared as to allow the waiting Powers to form
definite judgment--which, of course, they did not declare to him--as to
their own ultimate action.  The final result--if at this initial stage
such tentative setting forth of their own attitude in each case can be so
named--was that he returned full of hope (founded, he might say, upon a
justifiable personal belief) that the Great Powers throughout the
world--North, South, East, and West--were in thorough sympathy with the
Land of the Blue Mountains in its aspirations for the continuance of its
freedom.  "I also am honoured," he continued, "to bring to you, the Great
Council of the nation, the assurance of protection against unworthy
aggression on the part of neighbouring nations of present greater
strength."

Whilst he was speaking, the Gospodar Rupert was writing a few words on a
strip of paper, which he sent up to the President.  When the Voivode had
finished speaking, there was a prolonged silence.  The President rose,
and in a hush said that the Council would like to hear Mr. Rupert Sent
Leger, who had a communication to make regarding certain recent events.

Mr. Rupert Sent Leger rose, and reported how, since he had been entrusted
by the Council with the rescue of the Voivode Peter of Vissarion, he had,
by aid of the Voivodin, effected the escape of the Voivode from the
Silent Tower; also that, following this happy event, the mountaineers,
who had made a great cordon round the Tower so soon as it was known that
the Voivode had been imprisoned within it, had stormed it in the night.
As a determined resistance was offered by the marauders, who had used it
as a place of refuge, none of these escaped.  He then went on to tell how
he sought interview with the Captain of the strange warship, which,
without flying any flag, invaded our waters.  He asked the President to
call on me to read the report of that meeting.  This, in obedience to his
direction, I did.  The acquiescent murmuring of the Council showed how
thoroughly they endorsed Mr. Sent Leger's words and acts.

When I resumed my seat, Mr. Sent Leger described how, just before the
time fixed by the "pirate Captain"--so he designated him, as did every
speaker thereafter--the warship met with some under-sea accident, which
had a destructive effect on all on board her.  Then he added certain
words, which I give verbatim, as I am sure that others will some time
wish to remember them in their exactness:

"By the way, President and Lords of the Council, I trust I may ask you to
confirm Captain Rooke, of the armoured yacht _The Lady_, to be Admiral of
the Squadron of the Land of the Blue Mountains, and also Captain
(tentatively) Desmond, late First-Lieutenant of _The Lady_, to the
command of the second warship of our fleet--the as yet unnamed vessel,
whose former Captain threatened to bombard Ilsin.  My Lords, Admiral
Rooke has done great service to the Land of the Blue Mountains, and
deserves well at your hands.  You will have in him, I am sure, a great
official.  One who will till his last breath give you good and loyal
service."

He had sat down, the President put to the Council resolutions, which were
passed by acclamation.  Admiral Rooke was given command of the navy, and
Captain Desmond confirmed in his appointment to the captaincy of the new
ship, which was, by a further resolution, named _The Gospodar Rupert_.

In thanking the Council for acceding to his request, and for the great
honour done him in the naming of the ship, Mr. Sent Leger said:

"May I ask that the armoured yacht _The Lady_ be accepted by you, the
National Council, on behalf of the nation, as a gift on behalf of the
cause of freedom from the Voivodin Teuta?"

In response to the mighty cheer of the Council with which the splendid
gift was accepted the Gospodar Rupert--Mr. Sent Leger--bowed, and went
quietly out of the room.

As no agenda of the meeting had been prepared, there was for a time, not
silence, but much individual conversation.  In the midst of it the
Voivode rose up, whereupon there was a strict silence.  All listened with
an intensity of eagerness whilst he spoke.

"President and Lords of the Council, Archbishop, and Vladika, I should
but ill show my respect did I hesitate to tell you at this the first
opportunity I have had of certain matters personal primarily to myself,
but which, in the progress of recent events, have come to impinge on the
affairs of the nation.  Until I have done so, I shall not feel that I
have done a duty, long due to you or your predecessors in office, and
which I hope you will allow me to say that I have only kept back for
purposes of statecraft.  May I ask that you will come back with me in
memory to the year 1890, when our struggle against Ottoman aggression,
later on so successfully brought to a close, was begun.  We were then in
a desperate condition.  Our finances had run so low that we could not
purchase even the bread which we required.  Nay, more, we could not
procure through the National Exchequer what we wanted more than
bread--arms of modern effectiveness; for men may endure hunger and yet
fight well, as the glorious past of our country has proved again and
again and again.  But when our foes are better armed than we are, the
penalty is dreadful to a nation small as our own is in number, no matter
how brave their hearts.  In this strait I myself had to secretly raise a
sufficient sum of money to procure the weapons we needed.  To this end I
sought the assistance of a great merchant-prince, to whom our nation as
well as myself was known.  He met me in the same generous spirit which he
had shown to other struggling nationalities throughout a long and
honourable career.  When I pledged to him as security my own estates, he
wished to tear up the bond, and only under pressure would he meet my
wishes in this respect.  Lords of the Council, it was his money, thus
generously advanced, which procured for us the arms with which we hewed
out our freedom.

"Not long ago that noble merchant--and here I trust you will pardon me
that I am so moved as to perhaps appear to suffer in want of respect to
this great Council--this noble merchant passed to his account--leaving to
a near kinsman of his own the royal fortune which he had amassed.  Only a
few hours ago that worthy kinsman of the benefactor of our nation made it
known to me that in his last will he had bequeathed to me, by secret
trust, the whole of those estates which long ago I had forfeited by
effluxion of time, inasmuch as I had been unable to fulfil the terms of
my voluntary bond.  It grieves me to think that I have had to keep you so
long in ignorance of the good thought and wishes and acts of this great
man.

"But it was by his wise counsel, fortified by my own judgment, that I was
silent; for, indeed, I feared, as he did, lest in our troublous times
some doubting spirit without our boundaries, or even within it, might
mistrust the honesty of my purposes for public good, because I was no
longer one whose whole fortune was invested within our confines.  This
prince-merchant, the great English Roger Melton--let his name be for ever
graven on the hearts of our people!--kept silent during his own life, and
enjoined on others to come after him to keep secret from the men of the
Blue Mountains that secret loan made to me on their behalf, lest in their
eyes I, who had striven to be their friend and helper, should suffer
wrong repute.  But, happily, he has left me free to clear myself in your
eyes.  Moreover, by arranging to have--under certain contingencies, which
have come to pass--the estates which were originally my own retransferred
to me, I have no longer the honour of having given what I could to the
national cause.  All such now belongs to him; for it was his money--and
his only--which purchased our national armament.

"His worthy kinsman you already know, for he has not only been amongst
you for many months, but has already done you good service in his own
person.  He it was who, as a mighty warrior, answered the summons of the
Vladika when misfortune came upon my house in the capture by enemies of
my dear daughter, the Voivodin Teuta, whom you hold in your hearts; who,
with a chosen band of our brothers, pursued the marauders, and himself,
by a deed of daring and prowess, of which poets shall hereafter sing,
saved her, when hope itself seemed to be dead, from their ruthless hands,
and brought her back to us; who administered condign punishment to the
miscreants who had dared to so wrong her.  He it was who later took me,
your servant, out of the prison wherein another band of Turkish
miscreants held me captive; rescued me, with the help of my dear
daughter, whom he had already freed, whilst I had on my person the
documents of international secrecy of which I have already advised
you--rescued me whilst I had been as yet unsubjected to the indignity of
search.

"Beyond this you know now that of which I was in partial ignorance: how
he had, through the skill and devotion of your new Admiral, wrought
destruction on a hecatomb of our malignant foes.  You who have received
for the nation the splendid gift of the little warship, which already
represents a new era in naval armament, can understand the great-souled
generosity of the man who has restored the vast possessions of my House.
On our way hither from Ilsin, Rupert Sent Leger made known to me the
terms of the trust of his noble uncle, Roger Melton, and--believe me that
he did so generously, with a joy that transcended my own--restored to the
last male of the Vissarion race the whole inheritance of a noble line.

"And now, my Lords of the Council, I come to another matter, in which I
find myself in something of a difficulty, for I am aware that in certain
ways you actually know more of it than even I myself do.  It is regarding
the marriage of my daughter to Rupert Sent Leger.  It is known to me that
the matter has been brought before you by the Archbishop, who, as
guardian of my daughter during my absence on the service of the nation,
wished to obtain your sanction, as till my return he held her safety in
trust.  This was so, not from any merit of mine, but because she, in her
own person, had undertaken for the service of our nation a task of almost
incredible difficulty.  My Lords, were she child of another father, I
should extol to the skies her bravery, her self-devotion, her loyalty to
the land she loves.  Why, then, should I hesitate to speak of her deeds
in fitting terms, since it is my duty, my glory, to hold them in higher
honour than can any in this land?  I shall not shame her--or even
myself--by being silent when such a duty urges me to speak, as Voivode,
as trusted envoy of our nation, as father.  Ages hence loyal men and
women of our Land of the Blue Mountains will sing her deeds in song and
tell them in story.  Her name, Teuta, already sacred in these regions,
where it was held by a great Queen, and honoured by all men, will
hereafter be held as a symbol and type of woman's devotion.  Oh, my
Lords, we pass along the path of life, the best of us but a little time
marching in the sunlight between gloom and gloom, and it is during that
march that we must be judged for the future.  This brave woman has won
knightly spurs as well as any Paladin of old.  So is it meet that ere she
might mate with one worthy of her you, who hold in your hands the safety
and honour of the State, should give your approval.  To you was it given
to sit in judgment on the worth of this gallant Englisher, now my son.
You judged him then, before you had seen his valour, his strength, and
skill exercised on behalf of a national cause.  You judged wisely, oh, my
brothers, and out of a grateful heart I thank you one and all for it.
Well has he justified your trust by his later acts.  When, in obedience
to the summons of the Vladika, he put the nation in a blaze and ranged
our boundaries with a ring of steel, he did so unknowing that what was
dearest to him in the world was at stake.  He saved my daughter's honour
and happiness, and won her safety by an act of valour that outvies any
told in history.  He took my daughter with him to bring me out from the
Silent Tower on the wings of the air, when earth had for me no
possibility of freedom--I, that had even then in my possession the
documents involving other nations which the Soldan would fain have
purchased with the half of his empire.

"Henceforth to me, Lords of the Council, this brave man must ever be as a
son of my heart, and I trust that in his name grandsons of my own may
keep in bright honour the name which in glorious days of old my fathers
made illustrious.  Did I know how adequately to thank you for your
interest in my child, I would yield up to you my very soul in thanks."

The speech of the Voivode was received with the honour of the Blue
Mountains--the drawing and raising of handjars.



FROM RUPERT'S JOURNAL.


                                                          _July_ 14, 1907.

For nearly a week we waited for some message from Constantinople, fully
expecting either a declaration of war, or else some inquiry so couched as
to make war an inevitable result.  The National Council remained on at
Vissarion as the guests of the Voivode, to whom, in accordance with my
uncle's will, I had prepared to re-transfer all his estates.  He was, by
the way, unwilling at first to accept, and it was only when I showed him
Uncle Roger's letter, and made him read the Deed of Transfer prepared in
anticipation by Mr. Trent, that he allowed me to persuade him.  Finally
he said:

"As you, my good friends, have so arranged, I must accept, be it only in
honour to the wishes of the dead.  But remember, I only do so but for the
present, reserving to myself the freedom to withdraw later if I so
desire."

But Constantinople was silent.  The whole nefarious scheme was one of the
"put-up jobs" which are part of the dirty work of a certain order of
statecraft--to be accepted if successful; to be denied in case of
failure.

The matter stood thus: Turkey had thrown the dice--and lost.  Her men
were dead; her ship was forfeit.  It was only some ten days after the
warship was left derelict with every living thing--that is, everything
that had been living--with its neck broken, as Rooke informed me, when he
brought the ship down the creek, and housed it in the dock behind the
armoured gates--that we saw an item in _The Roma_ copied from _The
Constantinople Journal_ of July 9:

    "LOSS OF AN OTTOMAN IRONCLAD WITH ALL HANDS.

    "News has been received at Constantinople of the total loss, with all
    hands, of one of the newest and finest warships in the Turkish
    fleet--_The Mahmoud_, Captain Ali Ali--which foundered in a storm on
    the night of July 5, some distance off Cabrera, in the Balearic
    Isles.  There were no survivors, and no wreckage was discovered by
    the ships which went in relief--the _Pera_ and the _Mustapha_--or
    reported from anywhere along the shores of the islands, of which
    exhaustive search was made.  _The Mahmoud_ was double-manned, as she
    carried a full extra crew sent on an educational cruise on the most
    perfectly scientifically equipped warship on service in the
    Mediterranean waters."

When the Voivode and I talked over the matter, he said:

"After all, Turkey is a shrewd Power.  She certainly seems to know when
she is beaten, and does not intend to make a bad thing seem worse in the
eyes of the world."

Well, 'tis a bad wind that blows good to nobody.  As _The Mahmoud_ was
lost off the Balearics, it cannot have been her that put the marauders on
shore and trained her big guns on Ilsin.  We take it, therefore, that the
latter must have been a pirate, and as we have taken her derelict in our
waters, she is now ours in all ways.  Anyhow, she is ours, and is the
first ship of her class in the navy of the Blue Mountains.  I am inclined
to think that even if she was--or is still--a Turkish ship, Admiral Rooke
would not be inclined to let her go.  As for Captain Desmond, I think he
would go straight out of his mind if such a thing was to be even
suggested to him.

It will be a pity if we have any more trouble, for life here is very
happy with us all now.  The Voivode is, I think, like a man in a dream.
Teuta is ideally happy, and the real affection which sprang up between
them when she and Aunt Janet met is a joy to think of.  I had posted
Teuta about her, so that when they should meet my wife might not, by any
inadvertence, receive or cause any pain.  But the moment Teuta saw her
she ran straight over to her and lifted her in her strong young arms,
and, raising her up as one would lift a child, kissed her.  Then, when
she had put her sitting in the chair from which she had arisen when we
entered the room, she knelt down before her, and put her face down in her
lap.  Aunt Janet's face was a study; I myself could hardly say whether at
the first moment surprise or joy predominated.  But there could be no
doubt about it the instant after.  She seemed to beam with happiness.
When Teuta knelt to her, she could only say:

"My dear, my dear, I am glad!  Rupert's wife, you and I must love each
other very much."  Seeing that they were laughing and crying in each
other's arms, I thought it best to come away and leave them alone.  And I
didn't feel a bit lonely either when I was out of sight of them.  I knew
that where those two dear women were there was a place for my own heart.

When I came back, Teuta was sitting on Aunt Janet's knee.  It seemed
rather stupendous for the old lady, for Teuta is such a splendid creature
that even when she sits on my own knee and I catch a glimpse of us in
some mirror, I cannot but notice what a nobly-built girl she is.

My wife was jumping up as soon as I was seen, but Aunt Janet held her
tight to her, and said:

"Don't stir, dear.  It is such happiness to me to have you there.  Rupert
has always been my 'little boy,' and, in spite of all his being such a
giant, he is so still.  And so you, that he loves, must be my little
girl--in spite of all your beauty and your strength--and sit on my knee,
till you can place there a little one that shall be dear to us all, and
that shall let me feel my youth again.  When first I saw you I was
surprised, for, somehow, though I had never seen you nor even heard of
you, I seemed to know your face.  Sit where you are, dear.  It is only
Rupert--and we both love him."

Teuta looked at me, flushing rosily; but she sat quiet, and drew the old
lady's white head on her young breast.



JANET MACKELPIE'S NOTES.


                                                           _July_ 8, 1907.

I used to think that whenever Rupert should get married or start on the
way to it by getting engaged--I would meet his future wife with something
of the same affection that I have always had for himself.  But I know now
that what was really in my mind was _jealousy_, and that I was really
fighting against my own instincts, and pretending to myself that I was
not jealous.  Had I ever had the faintest idea that she would be anything
the least like Teuta, that sort of feeling should never have had even a
foothold.  No wonder my dear boy is in love with her, for, truth to tell,
I am in love with her myself.  I don't think I ever met a creature--a
woman creature, of course, I mean--with so many splendid qualities.  I
almost fear to say it, lest it should seem to myself wrong; but I think
she is as good as a woman as Rupert is as a man.  And what more than that
can I say?  I thought I loved her and trusted her, and knew her all I
could, until this morning.

I was in my own room, as it is still called.  For, though Rupert tells me
in confidence that under his uncle's will the whole estate of Vissarion,
Castle and all, really belongs to the Voivode, and though the Voivode has
been persuaded to accept the position, he (the Voivode) will not allow
anything to be changed.  He will not even hear a word of my going, or
changing my room, or anything.  And Rupert backs him up in it, and Teuta
too.  So what am I to do but let the dears have their way?

Well, this morning, when Rupert was with the Voivode at a meeting of the
National Council in the Great Hall, Teuta came to me, and (after closing
the door and bolting it, which surprised me a little) came and knelt down
beside me, and put her face in my lap.  I stroked her beautiful black
hair, and said:

"What is it, Teuta darling?  Is there any trouble?  And why did you bolt
the door?  Has anything happened to Rupert?"  When she looked up I saw
that her beautiful black eyes, with the stars in them, were overflowing
with tears not yet shed.  But she smiled through them, and the tears did
not fall.  When I saw her smile my heart was eased, and I said without
thinking: "Thank God, darling, Rupert is all right."

"I thank God, too, dear Aunt Janet!" she said softly; and I took her in
my arms and laid her head on my breast.

"Go on, dear," I said; "tell me what it is that troubles you?"  This time
I saw the tears drop, as she lowered her head and hid her face from me.

"I'm afraid I have deceived you, Aunt Janet, and that you will
not--cannot--forgive me."

"Lord save you, child!" I said, "there's nothing that you could do that I
could not and would not forgive.  Not that you would ever do anything
base, for that is the only thing that is hard to forgive.  Tell me now
what troubles you."

She looked up in my eyes fearlessly, this time with only the signs of
tears that had been, and said proudly:

"Nothing base, Aunt Janet.  My father's daughter would not willingly be
base.  I do not think she could.  Moreover, had I ever done anything base
I should not be here, for--for--I should never have been Rupert's wife!"

"Then what is it?  Tell your old Aunt Janet, dearie."  She answered me
with another question:

"Aunt Janet, do you know who I am, and how I first met Rupert?"

"You are the Voivodin Teuta Vissarion--the daughter of the Voivode--Or,
rather, you were; you are now Mrs. Rupert Sent Leger.  For he is still an
Englishman, and a good subject of our noble King."

"Yes, Aunt Janet," she said, "I am that, and proud to be it--prouder than
I would be were I my namesake, who was Queen in the old days.  But how
and where did I see Rupert first?"  I did not know, and frankly told her
so.  So she answered her question herself:

"I saw him first in his own room at night."  I knew in my heart that in
whatever she did had been nothing wrong, so I sat silent waiting for her
to go on:

"I was in danger, and in deadly fear.  I was afraid I might die--not that
I fear death--and I wanted help and warmth.  I was not dressed as I am
now!"

On the instant it came to me how I knew her face, even the first time I
had seen it.  I wished to help her out of the embarrassing part of her
confidence, so I said:

"Dearie, I think I know.  Tell me, child, will you put on the frock . . .
the dress . . . costume you wore that night, and let me see you in it?
It is not mere idle curiosity, my child, but something far, far above
such idle folly."

"Wait for me a minute, Aunt Janet," she said, as she rose up; "I shall
not be long."  Then she left the room.

In a very few minutes she was back.  Her appearance might have frightened
some people, for she was clad only in a shroud.  Her feet were bare, and
she walked across the room with the gait of an empress, and stood before
me with her eyes modestly cast down.  But when presently she looked up
and caught my eyes, a smile rippled over her face.  She threw herself
once more before me on her knees, and embraced me as she said:

"I was afraid I might frighten you, dear."  I knew I could truthfully
reassure her as to that, so I proceeded to do so:

"Do not worry yourself, my dear.  I am not by nature timid.  I come of a
fighting stock which has sent out heroes, and I belong to a family
wherein is the gift of Second Sight.  Why should we fear?  We know!
Moreover, I saw you in that dress before.  Teuta, I saw you and Rupert
married!"  This time she herself it was that seemed disconcerted.

"Saw us married!  How on earth did you manage to be there?"

"I was not there.  My Seeing was long before!  Tell me, dear, what day,
or rather what night, was it that you first saw Rupert?"  She answered
sadly:

"I do not know.  Alas!  I lost count of the days as I lay in the tomb in
that dreary Crypt."

"Was your--your clothing wet that night?" I asked.

"Yes.  I had to leave the Crypt, for a great flood was out, and the
church was flooded.  I had to seek help--warmth--for I feared I might
die.  Oh, I was not, as I have told you, afraid of death.  But I had
undertaken a terrible task to which I had pledged myself.  It was for my
father's sake, and the sake of the Land, and I felt that it was a part of
my duty to live.  And so I lived on, when death would have been relief.
It was to tell you all about this that I came to your room to-day.  But
how did you see me--us--married?"

"Ah, my child!" I answered, "that was before the marriage took place.
The morn after the night that you came in the wet, when, having been
troubled in uncanny dreaming, I came to see if Rupert was a'richt, I lost
remembrance o' my dreaming, for the floor was all wet, and that took off
my attention.  But later, the morn after Rupert used his fire in his room
for the first time, I told him what I had dreamt; for, lassie, my dear, I
saw ye as bride at that weddin' in fine lace o'er yer shrood, and
orange-flowers and ithers in yer black hair; an' I saw the stars in yer
bonny een--the een I love.  But oh, my dear, when I saw the shrood, and
kent what it might mean, I expeckit to see the worms crawl round yer
feet.  But do ye ask yer man to tell ye what I tell't him that morn.
'Twill interest ye to know how the hairt o' men can learn by dreams.  Has
he ever tellt ye aught o' this?"

"No, dear," she said simply.  "I think that perhaps he was afraid that
one or other of us, if not both, might be upset by it if he did.  You
see, he did not tell you anything at all of our meeting, though I am sure
that he will be glad when he knows that we both know all about it, and
have told each other everything."

That was very sweet of her, and very thoughtful in all ways, so I said
that which I thought would please her best--that is, the truth:

"Ah, lassie, that is what a wife should be--what a wife should do.
Rupert is blessed and happy to have his heart in your keeping."

I knew from the added warmth of her kiss what I had said had pleased her.

_Letter from Ernest Roger Halbard Melton_, _Humcroft_, _Salop_, _to
Rupert Sent Leger_, _Vissarion_, _Land of the Blue Mountains_.

                                                          _July_ 29, 1907.

    MY DEAR COUSIN RUPERT,

    We have heard such glowing accounts of Vissarion that I am coming out
    to see you.  As you are yourself now a landowner, you will understand
    that my coming is not altogether a pleasure.  Indeed, it is a duty
    first.  When my father dies I shall be head of the family--the family
    of which Uncle Roger, to whom we were related, was a member.  It is
    therefore meet and fitting that I should know something of our family
    branches and of their Seats.  I am not giving you time for much
    warning, so am coming on immediately--in fact, I shall arrive almost
    as soon as this letter.  But I want to catch you in the middle of
    your tricks.  I hear that the Blue Mountaineer girls are peaches, so
    don't send them _all_ away when you hear I'm coming!

    Do send a yacht up to Fiume to meet me.  I hear you have all sorts of
    craft at Vissarion.  The MacSkelpie, I hear, said you received her as
    a Queen; so I hope you will do the decent by one of your own flesh
    and blood, and the future Head of the House at that.  I shan't bring
    much of a retinue with me.  _I_ wasn't made a billionaire by old
    Roger, so can only take my modest "man Friday"--whose name is
    Jenkinson, and a Cockney at that.  So don't have too much gold lace
    and diamond-hilted scimitars about, like a good chap, or else he'll
    want the very worst--his wyges ryzed.  That old image Rooke that came
    over for Miss McS., and whom by chance I saw at the attorney man's,
    might pilot me down from Fiume.  The old
    gentleman-by-Act-of-Parliament Mr. Bingham Trent (I suppose he has
    hyphened it by this time) told me that Miss McS. said he "did her
    proud" when she went over under his charge.  I shall be at Fiume on
    the evening of Wednesday, and shall stay at the Europa, which is, I
    am told, the least indecent hotel in the place.  So you know where to
    find me, or any of your attendant demons can know, in case I am to
    suffer "substituted service."

                                                 Your affectionate Cousin,
                                              ERNEST ROGER HALBARD MELTON.

_Letter from Admiral Rooke to the Gospodar Rupert_.

                                                         _August_ 1, 1907.

    SIR,

    In obedience to your explicit direction that I should meet Mr. Ernest
    R. H. Melton at Fiume, and report to you exactly what occurred,
    "without keeping anything back,"--as you will remember you said, I
    beg to report.

    I brought the steam-yacht _Trent_ to Fiume, arriving there on the
    morning of Thursday.  At 11.30 p.m.  I went to meet the train from
    St. Peter, due 11.40.  It was something late, arriving just as the
    clock was beginning to strike midnight.  Mr. Melton was on board, and
    with him his valet Jenkinson.  I am bound to say that he did not seem
    very pleased with his journey, and expressed much disappointment at
    not seeing Your Honour awaiting him.  I explained, as you directed,
    that you had to attend with the Voivode Vissarion and the Vladika the
    National Council, which met at Plazac, or that otherwise you would
    have done yourself the pleasure of coming to meet him.  I had, of
    course, reserved rooms (the Prince of Wales's suite), for him at the
    Re d'Ungheria, and had waiting the carriage which the proprietor had
    provided for the Prince of Wales when he stayed there.  Mr. Melton
    took his valet with him (on the box-seat), and I followed in a
    _Stadtwagen_ with the luggage.  When I arrived, I found the _maitre
    d'hotel_ in a stupor of concern.  The English nobleman, he said, had
    found fault with everything, and used to him language to which he was
    not accustomed.  I quieted him, telling him that the stranger was
    probably unused to foreign ways, and assuring him that Your Honour
    had every faith in him.  He announced himself satisfied and happy at
    the assurance.  But I noticed that he promptly put everything in the
    hands of the headwaiter, telling him to satisfy the milor at any
    cost, and then went away to some urgent business in Vienna.  Clever
    man!

    I took Mr. Melton's orders for our journey in the morning, and asked
    if there was anything for which he wished.  He simply said to me:

    "Everything is rotten.  Go to hell, and shut the door after you!"
    His man, who seems a very decent little fellow, though he is as vain
    as a peacock, and speaks with a Cockney accent which is simply
    terrible, came down the passage after me, and explained "on his own,"
    as he expressed it, that his master, "Mr. Ernest," was upset by the
    long journey, and that I was not to mind.  I did not wish to make him
    uncomfortable, so I explained that I minded nothing except what Your
    Honour wished; that the steam-yacht would be ready at 7 a.m.; and
    that I should be waiting in the hotel from that time on till Mr.
    Melton cared to start, to bring him aboard.

    In the morning I waited till the man Jenkinson came and told me that
    Mr. Ernest would start at ten.  I asked if he would breakfast on
    board; he answered that he would take his _cafe-complet_ at the
    hotel, but breakfast on board.

    We left at ten, and took the electric pinnace out to the _Trent_,
    which lay, with steam up, in the roads.  Breakfast was served on
    board, by his orders, and presently he came up on the bridge, where I
    was in command.  He brought his man Jenkinson with him.  Seeing me
    there, and not (I suppose) understanding that I was in command, he
    unceremoniously ordered me to go on the deck.  Indeed, he named a
    place much lower.  I made a sign of silence to the quartermaster at
    the wheel, who had released the spokes, and was going, I feared, to
    make some impertinent remark.  Jenkinson joined me presently, and
    said, as some sort of explanation of his master's discourtesy (of
    which he was manifestly ashamed), if not as an amende:

    "The governor is in a hell of a wax this morning."

    When we got in sight of Meleda, Mr. Melton sent for me and asked me
    where we were to land.  I told him that, unless he wished to the
    contrary, we were to run to Vissarion; but that my instructions were
    to land at whatever port he wished.  Whereupon he told me that he
    wished to stay the night at some place where he might be able to see
    some "life."  He was pleased to add something, which I presume he
    thought jocular, about my being able to "coach" him in such matters,
    as doubtless even "an old has-been like you" had still some sort of
    an eye for a pretty girl.  I told him as respectfully as I could that
    I had no knowledge whatever on such subjects, which were possibly of
    some interest to younger men, but of none to me.  He said no more; so
    after waiting for further orders, but without receiving any, I said:

    "I suppose, sir, we shall run to Vissarion?"

    "Run to the devil, if you like!" was his reply, as he turned away.
    When we arrived in the creek at Vissarion, he seemed much
    milder--less aggressive in his manner; but when he heard that you
    were detained at Plazac, he got rather "fresh"--I use the American
    term--again.  I greatly feared there would be a serious misfortune
    before we got into the Castle, for on the dock was Julia, the wife of
    Michael, the Master of the Wine, who is, as you know, very beautiful.
    Mr. Melton seemed much taken with her; and she, being flattered by
    the attention of a strange gentleman and Your Honour's kinsman, put
    aside the stand-offishness of most of the Blue Mountain women.
    Whereupon Mr. Melton, forgetting himself, took her in his arms and
    kissed her.  Instantly there was a hubbub.  The mountaineers present
    drew their handjars, and almost on the instant sudden death appeared
    to be amongst us.  Happily the men waited as Michael, who had just
    arrived on the quay-wall as the outrage took place, ran forward,
    wheeling his handjar round his head, and manifestly intending to
    decapitate Mr. Melton.  On the instant--I am sorry to say it, for it
    created a terribly bad effect--Mr. Melton dropped on his knees in a
    state of panic.  There was just this good use in it--that there was a
    pause of a few seconds.  During that time the little Cockney valet,
    who has the heart of a man in him, literally burst his way forward,
    and stood in front of his master in boxing attitude, calling out:

    "'Ere, come on, the 'ole lot of ye! 'E ain't done no 'arm.  He honly
    kissed the gal, as any man would.  If ye want to cut off somebody's
    'ed, cut off mine.  I ain't afride!"  There was such genuine pluck in
    this, and it formed so fine a contrast to the other's craven attitude
    (forgive me, Your Honour; but you want the truth!), that I was glad
    he was an Englishman, too.  The mountaineers recognized his spirit,
    and saluted with their handjars, even Michael amongst the number.
    Half turning his head, the little man said in a fierce whisper:

    "Buck up, guv'nor!  Get up, or they'll slice ye!  'Ere's Mr. Rooke;
    'e'll see ye through it."

    By this time the men were amenable to reason, and when I reminded
    them that Mr. Melton was Your Honour's cousin, they put aside their
    handjars and went about their work.  I asked Mr. Melton to follow,
    and led the way to the Castle.

    When we got close to the great entrance within the walled courtyard,
    we found a large number of the servants gathered, and with them many
    of the mountaineers, who have kept an organized guard all round the
    Castle ever since the abducting of the Voivodin.  As both Your Honour
    and the Voivode were away at Plazac, the guard had for the time been
    doubled.  When the steward came and stood in the doorway, the
    servants stood off somewhat, and the mountaineers drew back to the
    farther sides and angles of the courtyard.  The Voivodin had, of
    course, been informed of the guest's (your cousin) coming, and came
    to meet him in the old custom of the Blue Mountains.  As Your Honour
    only came to the Blue Mountains recently, and as no occasion has been
    since then of illustrating the custom since the Voivode was away, and
    the Voivodin then believed to be dead, perhaps I, who have lived here
    so long, may explain:

    When to an old Blue Mountain house a guest comes whom it is wished to
    do honour, the Lady, as in the vernacular the mistress of the house
    is called, comes herself to meet the guest at the door--or, rather,
    _outside_ the door--so that she can herself conduct him within.  It
    is a pretty ceremony, and it is said that of old in kingly days the
    monarch always set much store by it.  The custom is that, when she
    approaches the honoured guest (he need not be royal), she bends--or
    more properly kneels--before him and kisses his hand.  It has been
    explained by historians that the symbolism is that the woman, showing
    obedience to her husband, as the married woman of the Blue Mountains
    always does, emphasizes that obedience to her husband's guest.  The
    custom is always observed in its largest formality when a young wife
    receives for the first time a guest, and especially one whom her
    husband wishes to honour.  The Voivodin was, of course, aware that
    Mr. Melton was your kinsman, and naturally wished to make the
    ceremony of honour as marked as possible, so as to show overtly her
    sense of her husband's worth.

    When we came into the courtyard, I held back, of course, for the
    honour is entirely individual, and is never extended to any other, no
    matter how worthy he may be.  Naturally Mr. Melton did not know the
    etiquette of the situation, and so for that is not to be blamed.  He
    took his valet with him when, seeing someone coming to the door, he
    went forward.  I thought he was going to rush to his welcomer.  Such,
    though not in the ritual, would have been natural in a young kinsman
    wishing to do honour to the bride of his host, and would to anyone
    have been both understandable and forgivable.  It did not occur to me
    at the time, but I have since thought that perhaps he had not then
    heard of Your Honour's marriage, which I trust you will, in justice
    to the young gentleman, bear in mind when considering the matter.
    Unhappily, however, he did not show any such eagerness.  On the
    contrary, he seemed to make a point of showing indifference.  It
    seemed to me myself that he, seeing somebody wishing to make much of
    him, took what he considered a safe opportunity of restoring to
    himself his own good opinion, which must have been considerably
    lowered in the episode of the Wine Master's wife.

    The Voivodin, thinking, doubtless, Your Honour, to add a fresh lustre
    to her welcome, had donned the costume which all her nation has now
    come to love and to accept as a dress of ceremonial honour.  She wore
    her shroud.  It moved the hearts of all of us who looked on to see
    it, and we appreciated its being worn for such a cause.  But Mr.
    Melton did not seem to care.  As he had been approaching she had
    begun to kneel, and was already on her knees whilst he was several
    yards away.  There he stopped and turned to speak to his valet, put a
    glass in his eye, and looked all round him and up and down--indeed,
    everywhere except at the Great Lady, who was on her knees before him,
    waiting to bid him welcome.  I could see in the eyes of such of the
    mountaineers as were within my range of vision a growing animosity;
    so, hoping to keep down any such expression, which I knew would cause
    harm to Your Honour and the Voivodin, I looked all round them
    straight in their faces with a fixed frown, which, indeed, they
    seemed to understand, for they regained, and for the time maintained,
    their usual dignified calm.  The Voivodin, may I say, bore the trial
    wonderfully.  No human being could see that she was in any degree
    pained or even surprised.  Mr. Melton stood looking round him so long
    that I had full time to regain my own attitude of calm.  At last he
    seemed to come back to the knowledge that someone was waiting for
    him, and sauntered leisurely forward.  There was so much
    insolence--mind you, not insolence that was intended to appear as
    such--in his movement that the mountaineers began to steal forward.
    When he was close up to the Voivodin, and she put out her hand to
    take his, he put forward _one finger_!  I could hear the intake of
    the breath of the men, now close around, for I had moved forward,
    too.  I thought it would be as well to be close to your guest, lest
    something should happen to him.  The Voivodin still kept her splendid
    self-control.  Raising the finger put forward by the guest with the
    same deference as though it had been the hand of a King, she bent her
    head down and kissed it.  Her duty of courtesy now done, she was
    preparing to rise, when he put his hand into his pocket, and, pulling
    out a sovereign, offered it to her.  His valet moved his hand
    forward, as if to pull back his arm, but it was too late.  I am sure,
    Your Honour, that no affront was intended.  He doubtless thought that
    he was doing a kindness of the sort usual in England when one "tips"
    a housekeeper.  But all the same, to one in her position, it was an
    affront, an insult, open and unmistakable.  So it was received by the
    mountaineers, whose handjars flashed out as one.  For a second it was
    so received even by the Voivodin, who, with face flushing scarlet,
    and the stars in her eves flaming red, sprang to her feet.  But in
    that second she had regained herself, and to all appearances her
    righteous anger passed away.  Stooping, she took the hand of her
    guest and raised it--you know how strong she is--and, holding it in
    hers, led him into the doorway, saying:

    "You are welcome, kinsman of my husband, to the house of my father,
    which is presently my husband's also.  Both are grieved that, duty
    having called them away for the time, they are unable to be here to
    help me to greet you."

    I tell you, Your Honour, that it was a lesson in self-respect which
    anyone who saw it can never forget.  As to me, it makes my flesh
    quiver, old as I am, with delight, and my heart leap.

    May I, as a faithful servant who has had many years of experience,
    suggest that Your Honour should seem--for the present, at any
    rate--not to know any of these things which I have reported, as you
    wished me to do.  Be sure that the Voivodin will tell you her
    gracious self aught that she would wish you to know.  And such
    reticence on your part must make for her happiness, even if it did
    not for your own.

    So that you may know all, as you desired, and that you may have time
    to school yourself to whatever attitude you think best to adopt, I
    send this off to you at once by fleet messenger.  Were the aeroplane
    here, I should take it myself.  I leave here shortly to await the
    arrival of Sir Colin at Otranto.

                                           Your Honour's faithful servant,
                                                                    ROOKE.



JANET MACKELPIE'S NOTES.


                                                         _August_ 9, 1907.

To me it seems very providential that Rupert was not at home when that
dreadful young man Ernest Melton arrived, though it is possible that if
Rupert had been present he would not have dared to conduct himself so
badly.  Of course, I heard all about it from the maids; Teuta never
opened her lips to me on the subject.  It was bad enough and stupid
enough for him to try to kiss a decent young woman like Julia, who is
really as good as gold and as modest as one of our own Highland lassies;
but to think of him insulting Teuta!  The little beast!  One would think
that a champion idiot out of an Equatorial asylum would know better!  If
Michael, the Wine Master, wanted to kill him, I wonder what my Rupert and
hers would have done?  I am truly thankful that he was not present.  And
I am thankful, too, that I was not present either, for I should have made
an exhibition of myself, and Rupert would not have liked that.  He--the
little beast! might have seen from the very dress that the dear girl wore
that there was something exceptional about her.  But on one account I
should have liked to see her.  They tell me that she was, in her true
dignity, like a Queen, and that her humility in receiving her husband's
kinsman was a lesson to every woman in the Land.  I must be careful not
to let Rupert know that I have heard of the incident.  Later on, when it
is all blown over and the young man has been got safely away, I shall
tell him of it.  Mr. Rooke--Lord High Admiral Rooke, I should say--must
be a really wonderful man to have so held himself in check; for, from
what I have heard of him, he must in his younger days have been worse
than Old Morgan of Panama.  Mr. Ernest Roger Halbard Melton, of Humcroft,
Salop, little knows how near he was to being "cleft to the chine" also.

Fortunately, I had heard of his meeting with Teuta before he came to see
me, for I did not get back from my walk till after he had arrived.
Teuta's noble example was before me, and I determined that I, too, would
show good manners under any circumstances.  But I didn't know how mean he
is.  Think of his saying to me that Rupert's position here must be a
great source of pride to me, who had been his nursery governess.  He said
"nursemaid" first, but then stumbled in his words, seeming to remember
something.  I did not turn a hair, I am glad to say.  It is a mercy Uncle
Colin was not here, for I honestly believe that, if he had been, he would
have done the "cleaving to the chine" himself.  It has been a narrow
escape for Master Ernest, for only this morning Rupert had a message,
sent on from Gibraltar, saying that he was arriving with his clansmen,
and that they would not be far behind his letter.  He would call at
Otranto in case someone should come across to pilot him to Vissarion.
Uncle told me all about that young cad having offered him one finger in
Mr. Trent's office, though, of course, he didn't let the cad see that he
noticed it.  I have no doubt that, when he does arrive, that young man,
if he is here still, will find that he will have to behave himself, if it
be only on Sir Colin's account alone.



THE SAME (LATER).


I had hardly finished writing when the lookout on the tower announced
that the _Teuta_, as Rupert calls his aeroplane, was sighted crossing the
mountains from Plazac.  I hurried up to see him arrive, for I had not as
yet seen him on his "aero."  Mr. Ernest Melton came up, too.  Teuta was,
of course, before any of us.  She seems to know by instinct when Rupert
is coming.

It was certainly a wonderful sight to see the little aeroplane, with
outspread wings like a bird in flight, come sailing high over the
mountains.  There was a head-wind, and they were beating against it;
otherwise we should not have had time to get to the tower before the
arrival.

When once the "aero" had begun to drop on the near side of the mountains,
however, and had got a measure of shelter from them, her pace was
extraordinary.  We could not tell, of course, what sort of pace she came
at from looking at herself.  But we gathered some idea from the rate at
which the mountains and hills seemed to slide away from under her.  When
she got over the foot-hills, which are about ten miles away, she came on
at a swift glide that seemed to throw the distance behind her.  When
quite close, she rose up a little till she was something higher than the
Tower, to which she came as straight as an arrow from the bow, and glided
to her moorings, stopping dead as Rupert pulled a lever, which seemed to
turn a barrier to the wind.  The Voivode sat beside Rupert, but I must
say that he seemed to hold on to the bar in front of him even more firmly
than Rupert held to his steering-gear.

When they had alighted, Rupert greeted his cousin with the utmost
kindness, and bade him welcome to Vissarion.

"I see," he said, "you have met Teuta.  Now you may congratulate me, if
you wish."

Mr. Melton made a long rodomontade about her beauty, but presently,
stumbling about in his speech, said something regarding it being unlucky
to appear in grave-clothes.  Rupert laughed, and clapped him on the
shoulder as he answered:

"That pattern of frock is likely to become a national dress for loyal
women of the Blue Mountains.  When you know something of what that dress
means to us all at present you will understand.  In the meantime, take it
that there is not a soul in the nation that does not love it and honour
her for wearing it."  To which the cad replied:

"Oh, indeed!  I thought it was some preparation for a fancy-dress ball."
Rupert's comment on this ill-natured speech was (for him) quite grumpily
given:

"I should not advise you to think such things whilst you are in this part
of the world, Ernest.  They bury men here for much less."

The cad seemed struck with something--either what Rupert had said or his
manner of saying it--for he was silent for several seconds before he
spoke.

"I'm very tired with that long journey, Rupert.  Would you and Mrs. Sent
Leger mind if I go to my own room and turn in?  My man can ask for a cup
of tea and a sandwich for me."



RUPERT'S JOURNAL.


                                                        _August_ 10, 1907.

When Ernest said he wished to retire it was about the wisest thing he
could have said or done, and it suited Teuta and me down to the ground.
I could see that the dear girl was agitated about something, so thought
it would be best for her to be quiet, and not worried with being civil to
the Bounder.  Though he is my cousin, I can't think of him as anything
else.  The Voivode and I had certain matters to attend to arising out of
the meeting of the Council, and when we were through the night was
closing in.  When I saw Teuta in our own rooms she said at once:

"Do you mind, dear, if I stay with Aunt Janet to-night?  She is very
upset and nervous, and when I offered to come to her she clung to me and
cried with relief."

So when I had had some supper, which I took with the Voivode, I came down
to my old quarters in the Garden Room, and turned in early.

I was awakened a little before dawn by the coming of the fighting monk
Theophrastos, a notable runner, who had an urgent message for me.  This
was the letter to me given to him by Rooke.  He had been cautioned to
give it into no other hand, but to find me wherever I might be, and
convey it personally.  When he had arrived at Plazac I had left on the
aeroplane, so he had turned back to Vissarion.

When I read Rooke's report of Ernest Melton's abominable conduct I was
more angry with him than I can say.  Indeed, I did not think before that
that I could be angry with him, for I have always despised him.  But this
was too much.  However, I realized the wisdom of Rooke's advice, and went
away by myself to get over my anger and reacquire my self-mastery.  The
aeroplane _Teuta_ was still housed on the tower, so I went up alone and
took it out.

When I had had a spin of about a hundred miles I felt better.  The
bracing of the wind and the quick, exhilarating motion restored me to
myself, and I felt able to cope with Master Ernest, or whatever else
chagrinable might come along, without giving myself away.  As Teuta had
thought it better to keep silence as to Ernest's affront, I felt I must
not acknowledge it; but, all the same, I determined to get rid of him
before the day was much older.

When I had had my breakfast I sent word to him by a servant that I was
coming to his rooms, and followed not long behind the messenger.

He was in a suit of silk pyjamas, such as not even Solomon in all his
glory was arrayed in.  I closed the door behind me before I began to
speak.  He listened, at first amazed, then disconcerted, then angry, and
then cowering down like a whipped hound.  I felt that it was a case for
speaking out.  A bumptious ass like him, who deliberately insulted
everyone he came across--for if all or any of his efforts in that way
were due to mere elemental ignorance he was not fit to live, but should
be silenced on sight as a modern Caliban--deserved neither pity nor
mercy.  To extend to him fine feeling, tolerance, and such-like
gentlenesses would be to deprive the world of them without benefit to
any.  So well as I can remember, what I said was something like this:

"Ernest, as you say, you've got to go, and to go quick, you understand.
I dare say you look on this as a land of barbarians, and think that any
of your high-toned refinements are thrown away on people here.  Well,
perhaps it is so.  Undoubtedly, the structure of the country is rough;
the mountains may only represent the glacial epoch; but so far as I can
gather from some of your exploits--for I have only learned a small part
as yet--you represent a period a good deal farther back.  You seem to
have given our folk here an exhibition of the playfulness of the hooligan
of the Saurian stage of development; but the Blue Mountains, rough as
they are, have come up out of the primeval slime, and even now the people
aim at better manners.  They may be rough, primitive, barbarian,
elemental, if you will, but they are not low down enough to tolerate
either your ethics or your taste.  My dear cousin, your life is not safe
here!  I am told that yesterday, only for the restraint exercised by
certain offended mountaineers on other grounds than your own worth, you
would have been abbreviated by the head.  Another day of your fascinating
presence would do away with this restraint, and then we should have a
scandal.  I am a new-comer here myself--too new a comer to be able to
afford a scandal of that kind--and so I shall not delay your going.
Believe me, my dear cousin, Ernest Roger Halbard Melton, of Humcroft,
Salop, that I am inconsolable about your resolution of immediate
departure, but I cannot shut my eyes to its wisdom.  At present the
matter is altogether amongst ourselves, and when you have gone--if it be
immediately--silence will be observed on all hands for the sake of the
house wherein you are a guest; but if there be time for scandal to
spread, you will be made, whether you be alive or dead, a European
laughing-stock.  Accordingly, I have anticipated your wishes, and have
ordered a fast steam yacht to take you to Ancona, or to whatever other
port you may desire.  The yacht will be under the command of Captain
Desmond, of one of our battleships--a most determined officer, who will
carry out any directions which may be given to him.  This will insure
your safety so far as Italian territory.  Some of his officials will
arrange a special carriage for you up to Flushing, and a cabin on the
steamer to Queenboro'.  A man of mine will travel on the train and
steamer with you, and will see that whatever you may wish in the way of
food or comfort will be provided.  Of course, you understand, my dear
cousin, that you are my guest until you arrive in London.  I have not
asked Rooke to accompany you, as when he went to meet you, it was a
mistake.  Indeed, there might have been a danger to you which I never
contemplated--a quite unnecessary danger, I assure you.  But happily
Admiral Rooke, though a man of strong passions, has wonderful
self-control."

"Admiral Rooke?" he queried.  "Admiral?"

"Admiral, certainly," I replied, "but not an ordinary Admiral--one of
many.  He is _the_ Admiral--the Lord High Admiral of the Land of the Blue
Mountains, with sole control of its expanding navy.  When such a man is
treated as a valet, there may be . . . But why go into this?  It is all
over.  I only mention it lest anything of a similar kind should occur
with Captain Desmond, who is a younger man, and therefore with probably
less self-repression."

I saw that he had learned his lesson, and so said no more on the subject.

There was another reason for his going which I did not speak of.  Sir
Colin MacKelpie was coming with his clansmen, and I knew he did not like
Ernest Melton.  I well remembered that episode of his offering one finger
to the old gentleman in Mr. Trent's office, and, moreover, I had my
suspicions that Aunt Janet's being upset was probably in some measure due
to some rudeness of his that she did not wish to speak about.  He is
really an impossible young man, and is far better out of this country
than in it.  If he remained here, there would be some sort of a tragedy
for certain.

I must say that it was with a feeling of considerable relief that I saw
the yacht steam out of the creek, with Captain Desmond on the bridge and
my cousin beside him.

Quite other were my feelings when, an hour after, _The Lady_ came flying
into the creek with the Lord High Admiral on the bridge, and beside him,
more splendid and soldier-like than ever, Sir Colin MacKelpie.  Mr.
Bingham Trent was also on the bridge.

The General was full of enthusiasm regarding his regiment, for in all,
those he brought with him and those finishing their training at home, the
force is near the number of a full regiment.  When we were alone he
explained to me that all was arranged regarding the non-commissioned
officers, but that he had held over the question of officers until we
should have had a suitable opportunity of talking the matter over
together.  He explained to me his reasons, which were certainly simple
and cogent.  Officers, according to him, are a different class, and
accustomed to a different standard altogether of life and living, of
duties and pleasures.  They are harder to deal with and more difficult to
obtain.  "There was no use," he said, "in getting a lot of failures, with
old-crusted ways of their own importance.  We must have young men for our
purpose--that is, men not old, but with some experience--men, of course,
who know how to behave themselves, or else, from what little I have seen
of the Blue Mountaineers, they wouldn't last long here if they went on as
some of them do elsewhere.  I shall start things here as you wish me to,
for I am here, my dear boy, to stay with you and Janet, and we shall, if
it be given to us by the Almighty, help to build up together a new
'nation'--an ally of Britain, who will stand at least as an outpost of
our own nation, and a guardian of our eastern road.  When things are
organized here on the military side, and are going strong, I shall, if
you can spare me, run back to London for a few weeks.  Whilst I am there
I shall pick up a lot of the sort of officers we want.  I know that there
are loads of them to be had.  I shall go slowly, however, and carefully,
too, and every man I bring back will be recommended to me by some old
soldier whom I know, and who knows the man he recommends, and has seen
him work.  We shall have, I dare say, an army for its size second to none
in the world, and the day may come when your old country will be proud of
your new one.  Now I'm off to see that all is ready for my people--your
people now."

I had had arrangements made for the comfort of the clansmen and the
women, but I knew that the good old soldier would see for himself that
his men were to be comfortable.  It was not for nothing that he
was--is--looked on as perhaps the General most beloved by his men in the
whole British Army.

When he had gone, and I was alone, Mr. Trent, who had evidently been
waiting for the opportunity, came to me.  When we had spoken of my
marriage and of Teuta, who seems to have made an immense impression on
him, he said suddenly:

"I suppose we are quite alone, and that we shall not be interrupted?"  I
summoned the man outside--there is always a sentry on guard outside my
door or near me, wherever I may be--and gave orders that I was not to be
disturbed until I gave fresh orders.  "If," I said, "there be anything
pressing or important, let the Voivodin or Miss MacKelpie know.  If
either of them brings anyone to me, it will be all right."

When we were quite alone Mr. Trent took a slip of paper and some
documents from the bag which was beside him.  He then read out items from
the slip, placing as he did so the documents so checked over before him.

1.  New Will made on marriage, to be signed presently.

2.  Copy of the Re-conveyance of Vissarion estates to Peter Vissarion, as
directed by Will of Roger Melton.

3.  Report of Correspondence with Privy Council, and proceedings
following.

Taking up the last named, he untied the red tape, and, holding the bundle
in his hand, went on:

"As you may, later on, wish to examine the details of the Proceedings, I
have copied out the various letters, the originals of which are put
safely away in my strong-room where, of course, they are always available
in case you may want them.  For your present information I shall give you
a rough synopsis of the Proceedings, referring where advisable to this
paper.

"On receipt of your letter of instructions regarding the Consent of the
Privy Council to your changing your nationality in accordance with the
terms of Roger Melton's Will, I put myself in communication with the
Clerk of the Privy Council, informing him of your wish to be naturalized
in due time to the Land of the Blue Mountains.  After some letters
between us, I got a summons to attend a meeting of the Council.

"I attended, as required, taking with me all necessary documents, and
such as I conceived might be advisable to produce, if wanted.

"The Lord President informed me that the present meeting of the Council
was specially summoned in obedience to the suggestion of the King, who
had been consulted as to his personal wishes on the subject--should he
have any.  The President then proceeded to inform me officially that all
Proceedings of the Privy Council were altogether confidential, and were
not to be made public under any circumstances.  He was gracious enough to
add:

"'The circumstances of this case, however, are unique; and as you act for
another, we have thought it advisable to enlarge your permission in the
matter, so as to allow you to communicate freely with your principal.  As
that gentleman is settling himself in a part of the world which has been
in the past, and may be again, united to this nation by some common
interest, His Majesty wishes Mr. Sent Leger to feel assured of the
good-will of Great Britain to the Land of the Blue Mountains, and even of
his own personal satisfaction that a gentleman of so distinguished a
lineage and such approved personal character is about to be--within his
own scope--a connecting-link between the nations.  To which end he has
graciously announced that, should the Privy Council acquiesce in the
request of Denaturalization, he will himself sign the Patent therefor.

"'The Privy Council has therefore held private session, at which the
matter has been discussed in its many bearings; and it is content that
the change can do no harm, but may be of some service to the two nations.
We have, therefore, agreed to grant the prayer of the Applicant; and the
officials of the Council have the matter of the form of Grant in hand.
So you, sir, may rest satisfied that as soon as the formalities--which
will, of course, require the formal signing of certain documents by the
Applicant--can be complied with, the Grant and Patent will obtain.'"

Having made this statement in formal style, my old friend went on in more
familiar way:

"And so, my dear Rupert, all is in hand; and before very long you will
have the freedom required under the Will, and will be at liberty to take
whatever steps may be necessary to be naturalized in your new country.

"I may tell you, by the way, that several members of the Council made
very complimentary remarks regarding you.  I am forbidden to give names,
but I may tell you facts.  One old Field-Marshal, whose name is familiar
to the whole world, said that he had served in many places with your
father, who was a very valiant soldier, and that he was glad that Great
Britain was to have in the future the benefit of your father's son in a
friendly land now beyond the outposts of our Empire, but which had been
one with her in the past, and might be again.

"So much for the Privy Council.  We can do no more at present until you
sign and have attested the documents which I have brought with me.

"We can now formally complete the settlement of the Vissarion estates,
which must be done whilst you are a British citizen.  So, too, with the
Will, the more formal and complete document, which is to take the place
of that short one which you forwarded to me the day after your marriage.
It may be, perhaps, necessary or advisable that, later on, when you are
naturalized here, you shall make a new Will in strictest accordance with
local law."



TEUTA SENT LEGER'S DIARY.


                                                        _August_ 19, 1907.

We had a journey to-day that was simply glorious.  We had been waiting to
take it for more than a week.  Rupert not only wanted the weather
suitable, but he had to wait till the new aeroplane came home.  It is
more than twice as big as our biggest up to now.  None of the others
could take all the party which Rupert wanted to go.  When he heard that
the aero was coming from Whitby, where it was sent from Leeds, he
directed by cable that it should be unshipped at Otranto, whence he took
it here all by himself.  I wanted to come with him, but he thought it
better not.  He says that Brindisi is too busy a place to keep anything
quiet--if not secret--and he wants to be very dark indeed about this, as
it is worked by the new radium engine.  Ever since they found radium in
our own hills he has been obsessed by the idea of an aerial navy for our
protection.  And after to-day's experiences I think he is right.  As he
wanted to survey the whole country at a glimpse, so that the general
scheme of defence might be put in hand, we had to have an aero big enough
to take the party as well as fast enough to do it rapidly, and all at
once.  We had, in addition to Rupert, my father, and myself, Sir Colin
and Lord High Admiral Rooke (I do like to give that splendid old fellow
his full title!).  The military and naval experts had with them
scientific apparatus of various kinds, also cameras and range-finders, so
that they could mark their maps as they required.  Rupert, of course,
drove, and I acted as his assistant.  Father, who has not yet become
accustomed to aerial travel, took a seat in the centre (which Rupert had
thoughtfully prepared for him), where there is very little motion.  I
must say I was amazed to see the way that splendid old soldier Sir Colin
bore himself.  He had never been on an aeroplane before, but, all the
same, he was as calm as if he was on a rock.  Height or motion did not
trouble him.  Indeed, he seemed to _enjoy_ himself all the time.  The
Admiral is himself almost an expert, but in any case I am sure he would
have been unconcerned, just as he was in the _Crab_ as Rupert has told
me.

We left just after daylight, and ran down south.  When we got to the east
of Ilsin, we kept slightly within the border-line, and went north or east
as it ran, making occasional loops inland over the mountains and back
again.  When we got up to our farthest point north, we began to go much
slower.  Sir Colin explained that for the rest all would be comparatively
plain-sailing in the way of defence; but that as any foreign Power other
than the Turk must attack from seaward, he would like to examine the
seaboard very carefully in conjunction with the Admiral, whose advice as
to sea defence would be invaluable.

Rupert was fine.  No one could help admiring him as he sat working his
lever and making the great machine obey every touch.  He was wrapped up
in his work.  I don't believe that whilst he was working he ever thought
of even me.  He _is_ splendid!

We got back just as the sun was dropping down over the Calabrian
Mountains.  It is quite wonderful how the horizon changes when you are
sailing away up high on an aeroplane.  Rupert is going to teach me how to
manage one all by myself, and when I am fit he will give me one, which he
is to have specially built for me.

I think I, too, have done some good work--at least, I have got some good
ideas--from our journey to-day.  Mine are not of war, but of peace, and I
think I see a way by which we shall be able to develop our country in a
wonderful way.  I shall talk the idea over with Rupert to-night, when we
are alone.  In the meantime Sir Colin and Admiral Rooke will think their
plans over individually, and to-morrow morning together.  Then the next
day they, too, are to go over their idea with Rupert and my father, and
something may be decided then.



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                        _August_ 21, 1907.

Our meeting on the subject of National Defence, held this afternoon, went
off well.  We were five in all, for with permission of the Voivode and
the two fighting-men, naval and military, I brought Teuta with me.  She
sat beside me quite quietly, and never made a remark of any kind till the
Defence business had been gone through.  Both Sir Colin and Admiral Rooke
were in perfect agreement as to the immediate steps to be taken for
defence.  In the first instance, the seaboard was to be properly
fortified in the necessary places, and the navy largely strengthened.
When we had got thus far I asked Rooke to tell of the navy increase
already in hand.  Whereupon he explained that, as we had found the small
battleship _The Lady_ of an excellent type for coast defence, acting only
in home waters, and of a size to take cover where necessary at many
places on our own shores, we had ordered nine others of the same pattern.
Of these the first four were already in hand, and were proceeding with
the greatest expedition.  The General then supplemented this by saying
that big guns could be used from points judiciously chosen on the
seaboard, which was in all so short a length that no very great quantity
of armament would be required.

"We can have," he said, "the biggest guns of the most perfect kind yet
accomplished, and use them from land batteries of the most up-to-date
pattern.  The one serious proposition we have to deal with is the defence
of the harbour--as yet quite undeveloped--which is known as the 'Blue
Mouth.'  Since our aerial journey I have been to it by sea with Admiral
Rooke in _The Lady_, and then on land with the Vladika, who was born on
its shores, and who knows every inch of it.

"It is worth fortifying--and fortifying well, for as a port it is
peerless in Mediterranean seas.  The navies of the world might ride in
it, land-locked, and even hidden from view seawards.  The mountains which
enclose it are in themselves absolute protection.  In addition, these can
only be assailed from our own territory.  Of course, Voivode, you
understand when I say 'our' I mean the Land of the Blue Mountains, for
whose safety and well-being I am alone concerned.  Any ship anchoring in
the roads of the Blue Mouth would have only one need--sufficient length
of cable for its magnificent depth.

"When proper guns are properly placed on the steep cliffs to north and
south of the entrance, and when the rock islet between has been armoured
and armed as will be necessary, the Mouth will be impregnable.  But we
should not depend on the aiming of the entrance alone.  At certain
salient points--which I have marked upon this map--armour-plated sunken
forts within earthworks should be established.  There should be covering
forts on the hillsides, and, of course, the final summits protected.
Thus we could resist attack on any side or all sides--from sea or land.
That port will yet mean the wealth as well as the strength of this
nation, so it will be well to have it properly protected.  This should be
done soon, and the utmost secrecy observed in the doing of it, lest the
so doing should become a matter of international concern."

Here Rooke smote the table hard.

"By God, that is true!  It has been the dream of my own life for this
many a year."

In the silence which followed the sweet, gentle voice of Teuta came clear
as a bell:

"May I say a word?  I am emboldened to, as Sir Colin has spoken so
splendidly, and as the Lord High Admiral has not hesitated to mention his
dreaming.  I, too, have had a dream--a day-dream--which came in a flash,
but no less a dream, for all that.  It was when we hung on the aeroplane
over the Blue Mouth.  It seemed to me in an instant that I saw that
beautiful spot as it will some time be--typical, as Sir Colin said, of
the wealth as well as the strength of this nation; a mart for the world
whence will come for barter some of the great wealth of the Blue
Mountains.  That wealth is as yet undeveloped.  But the day is at hand
when we may begin to use it, and through that very port.  Our mountains
and their valleys are clad with trees of splendid growth, virgin forests
of priceless worth; hard woods of all kinds, which have no superior
throughout the world.  In the rocks, though hidden as yet, is vast
mineral wealth of many kinds.  I have been looking through the reports of
the geological exports of the Commission of Investigation which my
husband organized soon after he came to live here, and, according to
them, our whole mountain ranges simply teem with vast quantities of
minerals, almost more precious for industry than gold and silver are for
commerce--though, indeed, gold is not altogether lacking as a mineral.
When once our work on the harbour is done, and the place has been made
secure against any attempt at foreign aggression, we must try to find a
way to bring this wealth of woods and ores down to the sea.

"And then, perhaps, may begin the great prosperity of our Land, of which
we have all dreamt."

She stopped, all vibrating, almost choked with emotion.  We were all
moved.  For myself, I was thrilled to the core.  Her enthusiasm was
all-sweeping, and under its influence I found my own imagination
expanding.  Out of its experiences I spoke:

"And there is a way.  I can see it.  Whilst our dear Voivodin was
speaking, the way seemed to clear.  I saw at the back of the Blue Mouth,
where it goes deepest into the heart of the cliffs, the opening of a
great tunnel, which ran upward over a steep slope till it debouched on
the first plateau beyond the range of the encompassing cliffs.  Thither
came by various rails of steep gradient, by timber-shoots and
cable-rails, by aerial cables and precipitating tubes, wealth from over
ground and under it; for as our Land is all mountains, and as these tower
up to the clouds, transport to the sea shall be easy and of little cost
when once the machinery is established.  As everything of much weight
goes downward, the cars of the main tunnel of the port shall return
upward without cost.  We can have from the mountains a head of water
under good control, which will allow of endless hydraulic power, so that
the whole port and the mechanism of the town to which it will grow can be
worked by it.

"This work can be put in hand at once.  So soon as the place shall be
perfectly surveyed and the engineering plans got ready, we can start on
the main tunnel, working from the sea-level up, so that the cost of the
transport of material will be almost nil.  This work can go on whilst the
forts are building; no time need be lost.

"Moreover, may I add a word on National Defence?  We are, though old in
honour, a young nation as to our place amongst Great Powers.  And so we
must show the courage and energy of a young nation.  The Empire of the
Air is not yet won.  Why should not we make a bid for it?  As our
mountains are lofty, so shall we have initial power of attack or defence.
We can have, in chosen spots amongst the clouds, depots of war
aeroplanes, with which we can descend and smite our enemies quickly on
land or sea.  We shall hope to live for Peace; but woe to those who drive
us to War!"

There is no doubt that the Vissarions are a warlike race.  As I spoke,
Teuta took one of my hands and held it hard.  The old Voivode, his eyes
blazing, rose and stood beside me and took the other.  The two old
fighting-men of the land and the sea stood up and saluted.

This was the beginning of what ultimately became "The National Committee
of Defence and Development."

I had other, and perhaps greater, plans for the future in my mind; but
the time had not come for their utterance.

To me it seems not only advisable, but necessary, that the utmost
discretion be observed by all our little group, at all events for the
present.  There seems to be some new uneasiness in the Blue Mountains.
There are constant meetings of members of the Council, but no formal
meeting of the Council, as such, since the last one at which I was
present.  There is constant coming and going amongst the mountaineers,
always in groups, small or large.  Teuta and I, who have been about very
much on the aeroplane, have both noticed it.  But somehow we--that is,
the Voivode and myself--are left out of everything; but we have not said
as yet a word on the subject to any of the others.  The Voivode notices,
but he says nothing; so I am silent, and Teuta does whatever I ask.  Sir
Colin does not notice anything except the work he is engaged on--the
planning the defences of the Blue Mouth.  His old scientific training as
an engineer, and his enormous experience of wars and sieges--for he was
for nearly fifty years sent as military representative to all the great
wars--seem to have become directed on that point.  He is certainly
planning it all out in a wonderful way.  He consults Rooke almost hourly
on the maritime side of the question.  The Lord High Admiral has been a
watcher all his life, and very few important points have ever escaped
him, so that he can add greatly to the wisdom of the defensive
construction.  He notices, I think, that something is going on outside
ourselves; but he keeps a resolute silence.

What the movement going on is I cannot guess.  It is not like the
uneasiness that went before the abduction of Teuta and the Voivode, but
it is even more pronounced.  That was an uneasiness founded on some
suspicion.  This is a positive thing, and has definite meaning--of some
sort.  We shall, I suppose, know all about it in good time.  In the
meantime we go on with our work.  Happily the whole Blue Mouth and the
mountains round it are on my own property, the portion acquired long ago
by Uncle Roger, exclusive of the Vissarion estate.  I asked the Voivode
to allow me to transfer it to him, but he sternly refused and forbade me,
quite peremptorily, to ever open the subject to him again.  "You have
done enough already," he said.  "Were I to allow you to go further, I
should feel mean.  And I do not think you would like your wife's father
to suffer that feeling after a long life, which he has tried to live in
honour."

I bowed, and said no more.  So there the matter rests, and I have to take
my own course.  I have had a survey made, and on the head of it the
Tunnel to the harbour is begun.




BOOK VIII: THE FLASHING OF THE HANDJAR


PRIVATE MEMORANDUM OF THE MEETING OF VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL
COUNCIL, HELD AT THE STATE HOUSE OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS AT PLAZAC ON
MONDAY, AUGUST 26, 1907.


(_Written by Cristoferos_, _Scribe of the Council_, _by instruction of
those present_.)

When the private meeting of various Members of the National Council had
assembled in the Council Hall of the State House at Plazac, it was as a
preliminary decided unanimously that now or hereafter no names of those
present were to be mentioned, and that officials appointed for the
purposes of this meeting should be designated by office only, the names
of all being withheld.

The proceedings assumed the shape of a general conversation, quite
informal, and therefore not to be recorded.  The nett outcome was the
unanimous expression of an opinion that the time, long contemplated by
very many persons throughout the nation, had now come when the
Constitution and machinery of the State should be changed; that the
present form of ruling by an Irregular Council was not sufficient, and
that a method more in accord with the spirit of the times should be
adopted.  To this end Constitutional Monarchy, such as that holding in
Great Britain, seemed best adapted.  Finally, it was decided that each
Member of the Council should make a personal canvass of his district,
talk over the matter with his electors, and bring back to another
meeting--or, rather, as it was amended, to this meeting postponed for a
week, until September 2nd--the opinions and wishes received.  Before
separating, the individual to be appointed King, in case the new idea
should prove grateful to the nation, was discussed.  The consensus of
opinion was entirely to the effect that the Voivode Peter Vissarion
should, if he would accept the high office, be appointed.  It was urged
that, as his daughter, the Voivodin Teuta, was now married to the
Englishman, Rupert Sent Leger--called generally by the mountaineers "the
Gospodar Rupert"--a successor to follow the Voivode when God should call
him would be at hand--a successor worthy in every way to succeed to so
illustrious a post.  It was urged by several speakers, with general
acquiescence, that already Mr. Sent Leger's services to the State were
such that he would be in himself a worthy person to begin the new
Dynasty; but that, as he was now allied to the Voivode Peter Vissarion,
it was becoming that the elder, born of the nation, should receive the
first honour.



THE SAME--_Continued_.


The adjourned meeting of certain members of the National Council was
resumed in the Hall of the State House at Plazac on Monday, September
2nd, 1907.  By motion the same chairman was appointed, and the rule
regarding the record renewed.

Reports were made by the various members of the Council in turn,
according to the State Roll.  Every district was represented.  The
reports were unanimously in favour of the New Constitution, and it was
reported by each and all of the Councillors that the utmost enthusiasm
marked in every case the suggestion of the Voivode Peter Vissarion as the
first King to be crowned under the new Constitution, and that remainder
should be settled on the Gospodar Rupert (the mountaineers would only
receive his lawful name as an alternative; one and all said that he would
be "Rupert" to them and to the nation--for ever).

The above matter having been satisfactorily settled, it was decided that
a formal meeting of the National Council should be held at the State
House, Plazac, in one week from to-day, and that the Voivode Peter
Vissarion should be asked to be in the State House in readiness to
attend.  It was also decided that instruction should be given to the High
Court of National Law to prepare and have ready, in skeleton form, a
rescript of the New Constitution to be adopted, the same to be founded on
the Constitution and Procedure of Great Britain, so far as the same may
be applicable to the traditional ideas of free Government in the Land of
the Blue Mountains.

By unanimous vote this private and irregular meeting of "Various National
Councillors" was then dissolved.



RECORD OF THE FIRST MEETING OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE LAND OF THE
BLUE MOUNTAINS, HELD AT PLAZAC ON MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 9TH, 1907, TO
CONSIDER THE ADOPTION OF A NEW CONSTITUTION, AND TO GIVE PERMANENT EFFECT
TO THE SAME IF, AND WHEN, DECIDED UPON.


(_Kept by the Monk Cristoferos_, _Scribe to the National Council_.)

The adjourned meeting duly took place as arranged.  There was a full
attendance of Members of the Council, together with the Vladika, the
Archbishop, the Archimandrites of Spazac, of Ispazar, of Domitan, and
Astrag; the Chancellor; the Lord of the Exchequer; the President of the
High Court of National Law; the President of the Council of Justice; and
such other high officials as it is customary to summon to meetings of the
National Council on occasions of great importance.  The names of all
present will be found in the full report, wherein are given the ipsissima
verba of the various utterances made during the consideration of the
questions discussed, the same having been taken down in shorthand by the
humble scribe of this precis, which has been made for the convenience of
Members of the Council and others.

The Voivode Peter Vissarion, obedient to the request of the Council, was
in attendance at the State House, waiting in the "Chamber of the High
Officers" until such time as he should be asked to come before the
Council.

The President put before the National Council the matter of the new
Constitution, outlining the headings of it as drawn up by the High Court
of National Law, and the Constitution having been formally accepted _nem.
con._ by the National Council on behalf of the people, he proposed that
the Crown should be offered to the Voivode Peter Vissarion, with
remainder to the "Gospodar Rupert" (legally, Rupert Sent Leger), husband
of his only child, the Voivodin Teuta.  This also was received with
enthusiasm, and passed _nem. con._

Thereupon the President of Council, the Archbishop, and the Vladika,
acting together as a deputation, went to pray the attention of the
Voivode Peter Vassarion.

When the Voivode entered, the whole Council and officials stood up, and
for a few seconds waited in respectful silence with heads bowed down.
Then, as if by a common impulse--for no word was spoken nor any signal
given--they all drew their handjars, and stood to attention--with points
raised and edges of the handjars to the front.

The Voivode stood very still.  He seemed much moved, but controlled
himself admirably.  The only time when be seemed to lose his self-control
was when, once again with a strange simultaneity, all present raised
their handjars on high, and shouted: "Hail, Peter, King!"  Then lowering
their points till these almost touched the ground, they once again stood
with bowed heads.

When he had quite mastered himself, the Voivode Peter Vissarion spoke:

"How can I, my brothers, sufficiently thank you, and, through you, the
people of the Blue Mountains, for the honour done to me this day?  In
very truth it is not possible, and therefore I pray you to consider it as
done, measuring my gratitude in the greatness of your own hearts.  Such
honour as you offer to me is not contemplated by any man in whose mind a
wholesome sanity rules, nor is it even the dream of fervent imagination.
So great is it, that I pray you, men with hearts and minds like my own,
to extend to me, as a further measure of your generosity, a little time
to think it over.  I shall not want long, for even already, with the
blaze of honour fresh upon me, I see the cool shadow of Duty, though his
substance is yet hardly visible.  Give me but an hour of solitude--an
hour at most--if it do not prolong this your session unduly.  It may be
that a lesser time will serve, but in any case I promise you that, when I
can see a just and fitting issue to my thought, I shall at once return."

The President of the Council looked around him, and, seeing everywhere
the bowing heads of acquiescence, spoke with a reverent gravity:

"We shall wait in patience whatsoever time you will, and may the God who
rules all worthy hearts guide you to His Will!"

And so in silence the Voivode passed out of the hall.

From my seat near a window I could watch him go, as with measured steps
he passed up the hill which rises behind the State House, and disappeared
into the shadow of the forest.  Then my work claimed me, for I wished to
record the proceedings so far whilst all was fresh in my mind.  In
silence, as of the dead, the Council waited, no man challenging opinion
of his neighbour even by a glance.

Almost a full hour had elapsed when the Voivode came again to the
Council, moving with slow and stately gravity, as has always been his
wont since age began to hamper the movement which in youth had been so
notable.  The Members of the Council all stood up uncovered, and so
remained while he made announcement of his conclusion.  He spoke slowly;
and as his answer was to be a valued record of this Land and its Race, I
wrote down every word as uttered, leaving here and there space for
description or comment, which spaces I have since then filled in.

"Lords of the National Council, Archbishop, Vladika, Lords of the Council
of Justice and of National Law, Archimandrites, and my brothers all, I
have, since I left you, held in the solitude of the forest counsel with
myself--and with God; and He, in His gracious wisdom, has led my thinking
to that conclusion which was from the first moment of knowledge of your
intent presaged in my heart.  Brothers, you know--or else a long life has
been spent in vain--that my heart and mind are all for the nation--my
experience, my life, my handjar.  And when all is for her, why should I
shrink to exercise on her behalf my riper judgment though the same should
have to combat my own ambition?  For ten centuries my race has not failed
in its duty.  Ages ago the men of that time trusted in the hands of my
ancestors the Kingship, even as now you, their children, trust me.  But
to me it would be base to betray that trust, even by the smallest tittle.
That would I do were I to take the honour of the crown which you have
tendered to me, so long as there is another more worthy to wear it.  Were
there none other, I should place myself in your hands, and yield myself
over to blind obedience of your desires.  But such an one there is; dear
to you already by his own deeds, now doubly dear to me, since he is my
son by my daughter's love.  He is young, whereas I am old.  He is strong
and brave and true; but my days of the usefulness of strength and bravery
are over.  For myself, I have long contemplated as the crown of my later
years a quiet life in one of our monasteries, where I can still watch the
whirl of the world around us on your behalf, and be a counsellor of
younger men of more active minds.  Brothers, we are entering on stirring
times.  I can see the signs of their coming all around us.  North and
South--the Old Order and the New, are about to clash, and we lie between
the opposing forces.  True it is that the Turk, after warring for a
thousand years, is fading into insignificance.  But from the North where
conquests spring, have crept towards our Balkans the men of a mightier
composite Power.  Their march has been steady; and as they came, they
fortified every step of the way.  Now they are hard upon us, and are
already beginning to swallow up the regions that we have helped to win
from the dominion of Mahound.  The Austrian is at our very gates.  Beaten
back by the Irredentists of Italy, she has so enmeshed herself with the
Great Powers of Europe that she seems for the moment to be impregnable to
a foe of our stature.  There is but one hope for us--the uniting of the
Balkan forces to turn a masterly front to North and West as well as to
South and East.  Is that a task for old hands to undertake?  No; the
hands must be young and supple; and the brain subtle, as well as the
heart be strong, of whomsoever would dare such an accomplishment.  Should
I accept the crown, it would only postpone the doing of that which must
ultimately be done.  What avail would it be if, when the darkness closes
over me, my daughter should be Queen Consort to the first King of a new
dynasty?  You know this man, and from your record I learn that you are
already willing to have him as King to follow me.  Why not begin with
him?  He comes of a great nation, wherein the principle of freedom is a
vital principle that quickens all things.  That nation has more than once
shown to us its friendliness; and doubtless the very fact that an
Englishman would become our King, and could carry into our Government the
spirit and customs which have made his own country great, would do much
to restore the old friendship, and even to create a new one, which would
in times of trouble bring British fleets to our waters, and British
bayonets to support our own handjars.  It is within my own knowledge,
though as yet unannounced to you, that Rupert Sent Leger has already
obtained a patent, signed by the King of England himself, allowing him to
be denaturalized in England, so that he can at once apply for
naturalization here.  I know also that he has brought hither a vast
fortune, by aid of which he is beginning to strengthen our hands for war,
in case that sad eventuality should arise.  Witness his late ordering to
be built nine other warships of the class that has already done such
effective service in overthrowing the Turk--or the pirate, whichever he
may have been.  He has undertaken the defence of the Blue Mouth at his
own cost in a way which will make it stronger than Gibraltar, and secure
us against whatever use to which the Austrian may apply the vast forces
already gathered in the Bocche di Cattaro.  He is already founding aerial
stations on our highest peaks for use of the war aeroplanes which are
being built for him.  It is such a man as this who makes a nation great;
and right sure I am that in his hands this splendid land and our noble,
freedom-loving people will flourish and become a power in the world.
Then, brothers, let me, as one to whom this nation and its history and
its future are dear, ask you to give to the husband of my daughter the
honour which you would confer on me.  For her I can speak as well as for
myself.  She shall suffer nothing in dignity either.  Were I indeed King,
she, as my daughter, would be a Princess of the world.  As it will be,
she shall be companion and Queen of a great King, and her race, which is
mine, shall flourish in all the lustre of the new Dynasty.

"Therefore on all accounts, my brothers, for the sake of our dear Land of
the Blue Mountains, make the Gospodar Rupert, who has so proved himself,
your King.  And make me happy in my retirement to the cloister."

When the Voivode ceased to speak, all still remained silent and standing.
But there was no mistaking their acquiescence in his most generous
prayer.  The President of the Council well interpreted the general wish
when he said:

"Lords of the National Council, Archbishop, Vladika, Lords of the
Councils of Justice and National Law, Archimandrites, and all who are
present, is it agreed that we prepare at leisure a fitting reply to the
Voivode Peter of the historic House of Vissarion, stating our agreement
with his wish?"

To which there was a unanimous answer:

"It is."  He went on:

"Further.  Shall we ask the Gospodar Rupert of the House of Sent Leger,
allied through his marriage to the Voivodin Teuta, daughter and only
child of the Voivode Peter of Vissarion, to come hither to-morrow?  And
that, when he is amongst us, we confer on him the Crown and Kingship of
the Land of the Blue Mountains?"

Again came the answer: "It is."

But this time it rang out like the sound of a gigantic trumpet, and the
handjars flashed.

Whereupon the session was adjourned for the space of a day.



THE SAME--_Continued_.


                                                     _September_ 10, 1907.

When the National Council met to-day the Voivode Peter Vissarion sat with
them, but well back, so that at first his presence was hardly noticeable.
After the necessary preliminaries had been gone through, they requested
the presence of the Gospodar Rupert--Mr. Rupert Sent Leger--who was
reported as waiting in the "Chamber of the High Officers."  He at once
accompanied back to the Hall the deputation sent to conduct him.  As he
made his appearance in the doorway the Councillors stood up.  There was a
burst of enthusiasm, and the handjars flashed.  For an instant he stood
silent, with lifted hand, as though indicating that he wished to speak.
So soon as this was recognized, silence fell on the assembly, and he
spoke:

"I pray you, may the Voivodin Teuta of Vissarion, who has accompanied me
hither, appear with me to hear your wishes?"  There was an immediate and
enthusiastic acquiescence, and, after bowing his thanks, he retired to
conduct her.

Her appearance was received with an ovation similar to that given to
Gospodar Rupert, to which she bowed with dignified sweetness.  She, with
her husband, was conducted to the top of the Hall by the President, who
came down to escort them.  In the meantime another chair had been placed
beside that prepared for the Gospodar, and these two sat.

The President then made the formal statement conveying to the "Gospodar
Rupert" the wishes of the Council, on behalf of the nation, to offer to
him the Crown and Kingship of the Land of the Blue Mountains.  The
message was couched in almost the same words as had been used the
previous day in making the offer to the Voivode Peter Vissarion, only
differing to meet the special circumstances.  The Gospodar Rupert
listened in grave silence.  The whole thing was manifestly quite new to
him, but he preserved a self-control wonderful under the circumstances.
When, having been made aware of the previous offer to the Voivode and the
declared wish of the latter, he rose to speak, there was stillness in the
Hall.  He commenced with a few broken words of thanks; then he grew
suddenly and strangely calm as he went on:

"But before I can even attempt to make a fitting reply, I should know if
it is contemplated to join with me in this great honour my dear wife the
Voivodin Teuta of Vissarion, who has so splendidly proved her worthiness
to hold any place in the government of the Land.  I fain would . . . "

He was interrupted by the Voivodin, who, standing up beside him and
holding his left arm, said:

"Do not, President, and Lords all, think me wanting in that respect of a
wife for husband which in the Blue Mountains we hold so dear, if I
venture to interrupt my lord.  I am here, not merely as a wife, but as
Voivodin of Vissarion, and by the memory of all the noble women of that
noble line I feel constrained to a great duty.  We women of Vissarion, in
all the history of centuries, have never put ourselves forward in rivalry
of our lords.  Well I know that my own dear lord will forgive me as wife
if I err; but I speak to you, the Council of the nation, from another
ground and with another tongue.  My lord does not, I fear, know as you
do, and as I do too, that of old, in the history of this Land, when
Kingship was existent, that it was ruled by that law of masculine
supremacy which, centuries after, became known as the _Lex Salica_.
Lords of the Council of the Blue Mountains, I am a wife of the Blue
Mountains--as a wife young as yet, but with the blood of forty
generations of loyal women in my veins.  And it would ill become me, whom
my husband honours--wife to the man whom you would honour--to take a part
in changing the ancient custom which has been held in honour for all the
thousand years, which is the glory of Blue Mountain womanhood.  What an
example such would be in an age when self-seeking women of other nations
seek to forget their womanhood in the struggle to vie in equality with
men!  Men of the Blue Mountains, I speak for our women when I say that we
hold of greatest price the glory of our men.  To be their companions is
our happiness; to be their wives is the completion of our lives; to be
mothers of their children is our share of the glory that is theirs.

"Therefore, I pray you, men of the Blue Mountains, let me but be as any
other wife in our land, equal to them in domestic happiness, which is our
woman's sphere; and if that priceless honour may be vouchsafed to me, and
I be worthy and able to bear it, an exemplar of woman's rectitude."  With
a low, modest, graceful bow, she sat down.

There was no doubt as to the reception of her renunciation of Queenly
dignity.  There was more honour to her in the quick, fierce shout which
arose, and the unanimous upward swing of the handjars, than in the
wearing of any crown which could adorn the head of woman.

The spontaneous action of the Gospodar Rupert was another source of joy
to all--a fitting corollary to what had gone before.  He rose to his
feet, and, taking his wife in his arms, kissed her before all.  Then they
sat down, with their chairs close, bashfully holding hands like a pair of
lovers.

Then Rupert arose--he is Rupert now; no lesser name is on the lips of his
people henceforth.  With an intense earnestness which seemed to glow in
his face, he said simply:

"What can I say except that I am in all ways, now and for ever, obedient
to your wishes?"  Then, raising his handjar and holding it before him, he
kissed the hilt, saying:

"Hereby I swear to be honest and just--to be, God helping me, such a King
as you would wish--in so far as the strength is given me.  Amen."

This ended the business of the Session, and the Council showed unmeasured
delight.  Again and again the handjars flashed, as the cheers rose "three
times three" in British fashion.

When Rupert--I am told I must not write him down as "King Rupert" until
after the formal crowning, which is ordained for Wednesday, October
16th,--and Teuta had withdrawn, the Voivode Peter Vissarion, the
President and Council conferred in committee with the Presidents of the
High Courts of National Law and of Justice as to the formalities to be
observed in the crowning of the King, and of the formal notification to
be given to foreign Powers.  These proceedings kept them far into the
night.

CORONATION FESTIVITIES OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS.

(_From our Special Correspondent_.)

                                                                   PLAZAC,
                                                       _October_ 14, 1907.

As I sat down to a poorly-equipped luncheon-table on board the
Austro-Orient liner _Franz Joseph_, I mourned in my heart (and I may say
incidentally in other portions of my internal economy) the comfort and
gastronomic luxury of the King and Emperor Hotel at Trieste.  A brief
comparison between the menus of to-day's lunch and yesterday's will
afford to the reader a striking object-lesson:
_Trieste_.                          _Steamer_.
Eggs a la cocotte.                  Scrambled eggs on toast.
Stewed chicken, with paprika.       Cold chicken.
Devilled slices of Westphalian      Cold ham.
ham  (boiled in wine).
Tunny fish, pickled.                Bismarck herrings.
Rice, burst in cream.               Stewed apples.
Guava jelly.                        Swiss cheese.
Consequence: Yesterday I was well and happy, and looked forward to a good
night's sleep, which came off.  To-day I am dull and heavy, also
restless, and I am convinced that at sleeping-time my liver will have it
all its own way.

The journey to Ragusa, and thence to Plazac, is writ large with a pigment
of misery on at least one human heart.  Let a silence fall upon it!  In
such wise only can Justice and Mercy join hands.

Plazac is a miserable place.  There is not a decent hotel in it.  It was
perhaps on this account that the new King, Rupert, had erected for the
alleged convenience of his guests of the Press a series of large
temporary hotels, such as were in evidence at the St. Louis Exposition.
Here each guest was given a room to himself, somewhat after the nature of
the cribs in a Rowton house.  From my first night in it I am able to
speak from experience of the sufferings of a prisoner of the third class.
I am, however, bound to say that the dining and reception rooms were,
though uncomfortably plain, adequate for temporary use.  Happily we shall
not have to endure many more meals here, as to-morrow we all dine with
the King in the State House; and as the cuisine is under the control of
that _cordon bleu_, Gaston de Faux Pas, who so long controlled the
gastronomic (we might almost say Gastonomic) destinies of the Rois des
Diamants in the Place Vendome, we may, I think, look forward to not going
to bed hungry.  Indeed, the anticipations formed from a survey of our
meagre sleeping accommodation were not realized at dinnertime to-night.
To our intense astonishment, an excellent dinner was served, though, to
be sure, the cold dishes predominated (a thing I always find bad for
one's liver).  Just as we were finishing, the King (nominated) came
amongst us in quite an informal way, and, having bidden us a hearty
welcome, asked that we should drink a glass of wine together.  This we
did in an excellent (if rather sweet) glass of Cliquot '93.  King Rupert
(nominated) then asked us to resume our seats.  He walked between the
tables, now and again recognizing some journalistic friend whom he had
met early in life in his days of adventure.  The men spoken to seemed
vastly pleased--with themselves probably.  Pretty bad form of them, I
call it!  For myself, I was glad I had not previously met him in the same
casual way, as it saved me from what I should have felt a
humiliation--the being patronized in that public way by a prospective
King who had not (in a Court sense) been born.  The writer, who is by
profession a barrister-at-law, is satisfied at being himself a county
gentleman and heir to an historic estate in the ancient county of Salop,
which can boast a larger population than the Land of the Blue Mountains.

EDITORIAL NOTE.--We must ask our readers to pardon the report in
yesterday's paper sent from Plazac.  The writer was not on our regular
staff, but asked to be allowed to write the report, as he was a kinsman
of King Rupert of the Blue Mountains, and would therefore be in a
position to obtain special information and facilities of description
"from inside," as he puts it.  On reading the paper, we cabled his
recall; we cabled also, in case he did not obey, to have his ejectment
effected forthwith.

We have also cabled Mr. Mordred Booth, the well-known correspondent, who
was, to our knowledge, in Plazac for his own purposes, to send us full
(and proper) details.  We take it our readers will prefer a graphic
account of the ceremony to a farrago of cheap menus, comments on his own
liver, and a belittling of an Englishman of such noble character and
achievements that a rising nation has chosen him for their King, and one
whom our own nation loves to honour.  We shall not, of course, mention
our abortive correspondent's name, unless compelled thereto by any future
utterance of his.

THE CORONATION OF KING RUPERT OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS.

(_By our Special Correspondent_, _Mordred Booth_.)

                                                                   PLAZAC,
                                                       _October_ 17, 1907.

Plazac does not boast of a cathedral or any church of sufficient
dimensions for a coronation ceremony on an adequate scale.  It was
therefore decided by the National Council, with the consent of the King,
that it should be held at the old church of St. Sava at Vissarion--the
former home of the Queen.  Accordingly, arrangements had been made to
bring thither on the warships on the morning of the coronation the whole
of the nation's guests.  In St. Sava's the religious ceremony would take
place, after which there would be a banquet in the Castle of Vissarion.
The guests would then return on the warships to Plazac, where would be
held what is called here the "National Coronation."

In the Land of the Blue Mountains it was customary in the old days, when
there were Kings, to have two ceremonies--one carried out by the official
head of the national Church, the Greek Church; the other by the people in
a ritual adopted by themselves, on much the same basis as the Germanic
Folk-Moot.  The Blue Mountains is a nation of strangely loyal tendencies.
What was a thousand years ago is to be to-day--so far, of course, as is
possible under the altered condition of things.

The church of St. Sava is very old and very beautiful, built in the
manner of old Greek churches, full of monuments of bygone worthies of the
Blue Mountains.  But, of course, neither it nor the ceremony held in it
to-day can compare in splendour with certain other ceremonials--for
instance, the coronation of the penultimate Czar in Moscow, of Alfonso
XII. in Madrid, of Carlos I. in Lisbon.

The church was arranged much after the fashion of Westminster Abbey for
the coronation of King Edward VII., though, of course, not so many
persons present, nor so much individual splendour.  Indeed, the number of
those present, outside those officially concerned and the Press of the
world, was very few.

The most striking figure present--next to King Rupert, who is seven feet
high and a magnificent man--was the Queen Consort, Teuta.  She sat in
front of a small gallery erected for the purpose just opposite the
throne.  She is a strikingly beautiful woman, tall and finely-formed,
with jet-black hair and eyes like black diamonds, but with the unique
quality that there are stars in them which seem to take varied colour
according to each strong emotion.  But it was not even her beauty or the
stars in her eyes which drew the first glance of all.  These details
showed on scrutiny, but from afar off the attractive point was her dress.
Surely never before did woman, be she Queen or peasant, wear such a
costume on a festive occasion.

She was dressed in a white _Shroud_, and in that only.  I had heard
something of the story which goes behind that strange costume, and shall
later on send it to you. {2}

When the procession entered the church through the great western door,
the national song of the Blue Mountains, "Guide our feet through
darkness, O Jehovah," was sung by an unseen choir, in which the organ,
supplemented by martial instruments, joined.  The Archbishop was robed in
readiness before the altar, and close around him stood the Archimandrites
of the four great monasteries.  The Vladika stood in front of the Members
of the National Council.  A little to one side of this body was a group
of high officials, Presidents of the Councils of National Law and
Justice, the Chancellor, etc.--all in splendid robes of great
antiquity--the High Marshall of the Forces and the Lord high Admiral.

When all was ready for the ceremonial act of coronation, the Archbishop
raised his hand, whereupon the music ceased.  Turning around, so that he
faced the Queen, who thereon stood up, the King drew his handjar and
saluted her in Blue Mountain fashion--the point raised as high possible,
and then dropped down till it almost touches the ground.  Every man in
the church, ecclesiastics and all, wear the handjar, and, following the
King by the interval of a second, their weapons flashed out.  There was
something symbolic, as well as touching, in this truly royal salute, led
by the King.  His handjar is a mighty blade, and held high in the hands
of a man of his stature, it overtowered everything in the church.  It was
an inspiriting sight.  No one who saw will ever forget that noble
flashing of blades in the thousand-year-old salute . . .

The coronation was short, simple, and impressive.  Rupert knelt whilst
the Archbishop, after a short, fervent prayer, placed on his head the
bronze crown of the first King of the Blue Mountains, Peter.  This was
handed to him by the Vladika, to whom it was brought from the National
Treasury by a procession of the high officers.  A blessing of the new
King and his Queen Teuta concluded the ceremony.  Rupert's first act on
rising from his knees was to draw his handjar and salute his people.

After the ceremony in St. Sava, the procession was reformed, and took its
way to the Castle of Vissarion, which is some distance off across a
picturesque creek, bounded on either side by noble cliffs of vast height.
The King led the way, the Queen walking with him and holding his hand . .
. The Castle of Vissarion is of great antiquity, and picturesque beyond
belief.  I am sending later on, as a special article, a description of it
. . .

The "Coronation Feast," as it was called on the menu, was held in the
Great Hall, which is of noble proportions.  I enclose copy of the menu,
as our readers may wish to know something of the details of such a feast
in this part of the world.

One feature of the banquet was specially noticeable.  As the National
Officials were guests of the King and Queen, they were waited on and
served by the King and Queen in person.  The rest of the guests,
including us of the Press, were served by the King's household, not the
servants--none of that cult were visible--but by the ladies and gentlemen
of the Court.

There was only one toast, and that was given by the King, all standing:
"The Land of the Blue Mountains, and may we all do our duty to the Land
we love!"  Before drinking, his mighty handjar flashed out again, and in
an instant every table at which the Blue Mountaineers sat was ringed with
flashing steel.  I may add parenthetically that the handjar is
essentially the national weapon.  I do not know if the Blue Mountaineers
take it to bed with them, but they certainly wear it everywhere else.
Its drawing seems to emphasize everything in national life . . .

We embarked again on the warships--one a huge, steel-plated Dreadnought,
up to date in every particular, the other an armoured yacht most complete
in every way, and of unique speed.  The King and Queen, the Lords of the
Council, together with the various high ecclesiastics and great
officials, went on the yacht, which the Lord High Admiral, a man of
remarkably masterful physiognomy, himself steered.  The rest of those
present at the Coronation came on the warship.  The latter went fast, but
the yacht showed her heels all the way.  However, the King's party waited
in the dock in the Blue Mouth.  From this a new cable-line took us all to
the State House at Plazac.  Here the procession was reformed, and wound
its way to a bare hill in the immediate vicinity.  The King and
Queen--the King still wearing the ancient bronze crown with which the
Archbishop had invested him at St. Sava's--the Archbishop, the Vladika,
and the four Archimandrites stood together at the top of the hill, the
King and Queen being, of course, in the front.  A courteous young
gentleman, to whom I had been accredited at the beginning of the day--all
guests were so attended--explained to me that, as this was the national
as opposed to the religious ceremony, the Vladika, who is the official
representative of the laity, took command here.  The ecclesiastics were
put prominently forward, simply out of courtesy, in obedience to the wish
of the people, by whom they were all greatly beloved.

Then commenced another unique ceremony, which, indeed, might well find a
place in our Western countries.  As far as ever we could see were masses
of men roughly grouped, not in any uniform, but all in national costume,
and armed only with the handjar.  In the front of each of these groups or
bodies stood the National Councillor for that district, distinguishable
by his official robe and chain.  There were in all seventeen of these
bodies.  These were unequal in numbers, some of them predominating
enormously over others, as, indeed, might be expected in so mountainous a
country.  In all there were present, I was told, over a hundred thousand
men.  So far as I can judge from long experience of looking at great
bodies of men, the estimate was a just one.  I was a little surprised to
see so many, for the population of the Blue Mountains is never accredited
in books of geography as a large one.  When I made inquiry as to how the
frontier guard was being for the time maintained, I was told:

"By the women mainly.  But, all the same, we have also a male guard which
covers the whole frontier except that to seaward.  Each man has with him
six women, so that the whole line is unbroken.  Moreover, sir, you must
bear in mind that in the Blue Mountains our women are trained to arms as
well as our men--ay, and they could give a good account of themselves,
too, against any foe that should assail us.  Our history shows what women
can do in defence.  I tell you, the Turkish population would be bigger
to-day but for the women who on our frontier fought of old for defence of
their homes!"

"No wonder this nation has kept her freedom for a thousand years!" I
said.

At a signal given by the President of the National Council one of the
Divisions moved forwards.  It was not an ordinary movement, but an
intense rush made with all the _elan_ and vigour of hardy and
highly-trained men.  They came on, not merely at the double, but as if
delivering an attack.  Handjar in hand, they rushed forward.  I can only
compare their rush to an artillery charge or to an attack of massed
cavalry battalions.  It was my fortune to see the former at Magenta and
the latter at Sadowa, so that I know what such illustration means.  I may
also say that I saw the relief column which Roberts organized rush
through a town on its way to relieve Mafeking; and no one who had the
delight of seeing that inspiring progress of a flying army on their way
to relieve their comrades needs to be told what a rush of armed men can
be.  With speed which was simply desperate they ran up the hill, and,
circling to the left, made a ring round the topmost plateau, where stood
the King.  When the ring was complete, the stream went on lapping round
and round till the whole tally was exhausted.  In the meantime another
Division had followed, its leader joining close behind the end of the
first.  Then came another and another.  An unbroken line circled and
circled round the hill in seeming endless array, till the whole slopes
were massed with moving men, dark in colour, and with countless
glittering points everywhere.  When the whole of the Divisions had thus
surrounded the King, there was a moment's hush--a silence so still that
it almost seemed as if Nature stood still also.  We who looked on were
almost afraid to breathe.

Then suddenly, without, so far as I could see, any fugleman or word of
command, the handjars of all that mighty array of men flashed upward as
one, and like thunder pealed the National cry:

"The Blue Mountains and Duty!"

After the cry there was a strange subsidence which made the onlooker rub
his eyes.  It seemed as though the whole mass of fighting men had
partially sunk into the ground.  Then the splendid truth burst upon
us--the whole nation was kneeling at the feet of their chosen King, who
stood upright.

Another moment of silence, as King Rupert, taking off his crown, held it
up in his left hand, and, holding his great handjar high in his right,
cried in a voice so strong that it came ringing over that serried mass
like a trumpet:

"To Freedom of our Nation, and to Freedom within it, I dedicate these and
myself.  I swear!"

So saying, he, too, sank on his knees, whilst we all instinctively
uncovered.

The silence which followed lasted several seconds; then, without a sign,
as though one and all acted instinctively, the whole body stood up.
Thereupon was executed a movement which, with all my experience of
soldiers and war, I never saw equalled--not with the Russian Royal Guard
saluting the Czar at his Coronation, not with an impi of Cetewayo's Zulus
whirling through the opening of a kraal.

For a second or two the whole mass seemed to writhe or shudder, and then,
lo! the whole District Divisions were massed again in completeness, its
Councillors next the King, and the Divisions radiating outwards down the
hill like wedges.

This completed the ceremony, and everything broke up into units.  Later,
I was told by my official friend that the King's last movement--the oath
as he sank to his knees--was an innovation of his own.  All I can say is,
if, in the future, and for all time, it is not taken for a precedent, and
made an important part of the Patriotic Coronation ceremony, the Blue
Mountaineers will prove themselves to be a much more stupid people than
they seem at present to be.

The conclusion of the Coronation festivities was a time of unalloyed joy.
It was the banquet given to the King and Queen by the nation; the guests
of the nation were included in the royal party.  It was a unique
ceremony.  Fancy a picnic-party of a hundred thousand persons, nearly all
men.  There must have been made beforehand vast and elaborate
preparations, ramifying through the whole nation.  Each section had
brought provisions sufficient for their own consumption in addition to
several special dishes for the guest-tables; but the contribution of each
section was not consumed by its own members.

It was evidently a part of the scheme that all should derive from a
common stock, so that the feeling of brotherhood and common property
should be preserved in this monumental fashion.

The guest-tables were the only tables to be seen.  The bulk of the
feasters sat on the ground.  The tables were brought forward by the men
themselves--no such thing as domestic service was known on this day--from
a wood close at hand, where they and the chairs had been placed in
readiness.  The linen and crockery used had been sent for the purpose
from the households of every town and village.  The flowers were plucked
in the mountains early that morning by the children, and the gold and
silver plate used for adornment were supplied from the churches.  Each
dish at the guest-tables was served by the men of each section in turn.

Over the whole array seemed to be spread an atmosphere of joyousness, of
peace, of brotherhood.  It would be impossible to adequately describe
that amazing scene, a whole nation of splendid men surrounding their new
King and Queen, loving to honour and serve them.  Scattered about through
that vast crowd were groups of musicians, chosen from amongst themselves.
The space covered by this titanic picnic was so vast that there were few
spots from which you could hear music proceeding from different quarters.

After dinner we all sat and smoked; the music became rather vocal than
instrumental--indeed, presently we did not hear the sound of any
instrument at all.  Only knowing a few words of Balkan, I could not
follow the meanings of the songs, but I gathered that they were all
legendary or historical.  To those who could understand, as I was
informed by my tutelary young friend, who stayed beside me the whole of
this memorable day, we were listening to the history of the Land of the
Blue Mountains in ballad form.  Somewhere or other throughout that vast
concourse each notable record of ten centuries was being told to eager
ears.

It was now late in the day.  Slowly the sun had been dropping down over
the Calabrian Mountains, and the glamorous twilight was stealing over the
immediate scene.  No one seemed to notice the coming of the dark, which
stole down on us with an unspeakable mystery.  For long we sat still, the
clatter of many tongues becoming stilled into the witchery of the scene.
Lower the sun sank, till only the ruddiness of the afterglow lit the
expanse with rosy light; then this failed in turn, and the night shut
down quickly.

At last, when we could just discern the faces close to us, a simultaneous
movement began.  Lights began to flash out in places all over the
hillside.  At first these seemed as tiny as glow-worms seen in a summer
wood, but by degrees they grew till the space was set with little circles
of light.  These in turn grew and grew in both number and strength.
Flames began to leap out from piles of wood, torches were lighted and
held high.  Then the music began again, softly at first, but then louder
as the musicians began to gather to the centre, where sat the King and
Queen.  The music was wild and semi-barbaric, but full of sweet melody.
It somehow seemed to bring before us a distant past; one and all,
according to the strength of our imagination and the volume of our
knowledge, saw episodes and phases of bygone history come before us.
There was a wonderful rhythmic, almost choric, force in the time kept,
which made it almost impossible to sit still.  It was an invitation to
the dance such as I had never before heard in any nation or at any time.
Then the lights began to gather round.  Once more the mountaineers took
something of the same formation as at the crowning.  Where the royal
party sat was a level mead, with crisp, short grass, and round it what
one might well call the Ring of the Nation was formed.

The music grew louder.  Each mountaineer who had not a lit torch already
lighted one, and the whole rising hillside was a glory of light.  The
Queen rose, and the King an instant after.  As they rose men stepped
forward and carried away their chairs, or rather thrones.  The Queen gave
the King her hand--this is, it seems, the privilege of the wife as
distinguished from any other woman.  Their feet took the time of the
music, and they moved into the centre of the ring.

That dance was another thing to remember, won from the haunting memories
of that strange day.  At first the King and Queen danced all alone.  They
began with stately movement, but as the music quickened their feet kept
time, and the swing of their bodies with movements kept growing more and
more ecstatic at every beat till, in true Balkan fashion, the dance
became a very agony of passionate movement.

At this point the music slowed down again, and the mountaineers began to
join in the dance.  At first slowly, one by one, they joined in, the
Vladika and the higher priests leading; then everywhere the whole vast
crowd began to dance, till the earth around us seemed to shake.  The
lights quivered, flickered, blazed out again, and rose and fell as that
hundred thousand men, each holding a torch, rose and fell with the rhythm
of the dance.  Quicker, quicker grew the music, faster grew the rushing
and pounding of the feet, till the whole nation seemed now in an ecstasy.

I stood near the Vladika, and in the midst of this final wildness I saw
him draw from his belt a short, thin flute; then he put it to his lips
and blew a single note--a fierce, sharp note, which pierced the volume of
sound more surely than would the thunder of a cannon-shot.  On the
instant everywhere each man put his torch under his foot.

There was complete and immediate darkness, for the fires, which had by
now fallen low, had evidently been trodden out in the measure of the
dance.  The music still kept in its rhythmic beat, but slower than it had
yet been.  Little by little this beat was pointed and emphasized by the
clapping of hands--at first only a few, but spreading till everyone
present was beating hands to the slow music in the darkness.  This lasted
a little while, during which, looking round, I noticed a faint light
beginning to steal up behind the hills.  The moon was rising.

Again there came a note from the Vladika's flute--a single note, sweet
and subtle, which I can only compare with a note from a nightingale,
vastly increased in powers.  It, too, won through the thunder of the
hand-claps, and on the second the sound ceased.  The sudden stillness,
together with the darkness, was so impressive that we could almost hear
our hearts beating.  And then came through the darkness the most
beautiful and impressive sound heard yet.  That mighty concourse, without
fugleman of any sort, began, in low, fervent voice, to sing the National
Anthem.  At first it was of so low tone as to convey the idea of a mighty
assembly of violinists playing with the mutes on.  But it gradually rose
till the air above us seemed to throb and quiver.  Each syllable--each
word--spoken in unison by the vast throng was as clearly enunciated as
though spoken by a single voice:

"Guide our feet through darkness, O Jehovah."

This anthem, sung out of full hearts, remains on our minds as the last
perfection of a perfect day.  For myself, I am not ashamed to own that it
made me weep like a child.  Indeed, I cannot write of it now as I would;
it unmans me so!

                                * * * * *

In the early morning, whilst the mountains were still rather grey than
blue, the cable-line took us to the Blue Mouth, where we embarked in the
King's yacht, _The Lady_, which took us across the Adriatic at a pace
which I had hitherto considered impossible.  The King and Queen came to
the landing to see us off.  They stood together at the right-hand side of
the red-carpeted gangway, and shook hands with each guest as he went on
board.  The instant the last passenger had stepped on deck the gangway
was withdrawn.  The Lord High Admiral, who stood on the bridge, raised
his hand, and we swept towards the mouth of the gulf.  Of course, all
hats were off, and we cheered frantically.  I can truly say that if King
Rupert and Queen Teuta should ever wish to found in the Blue Mountains a
colony of diplomatists and journalists, those who were their guests on
this great occasion will volunteer to a man.  I think old Hempetch, who
is the doyen of English-speaking journalists, voiced our sentiments when
he said:

"May God bless them and theirs with every grace and happiness, and send
prosperity to the Land and the rule!"  I think the King and Queen heard
us cheer, they turned to look at our flying ship again.




BOOK IX: BALKA


RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_ (_Longe Intervallo_).


                                                      _February_ 10, 1908.

It is so long since I even thought of this journal that I hardly know
where to begin.  I always heard that a married man is a pretty busy man;
but since I became one, though it is a new life to me, and of a happiness
undreamt of, I _know_ what that life is.  But I had no idea that this
King business was anything like what it is.  Why, it never leaves me a
moment at all to myself--or, what is worse, to Teuta.  If people who
condemn Kings had only a single month of my life in that capacity, they
would form an opinion different from that which they hold.  It might be
useful to have a Professor of Kingship in the Anarchists'
College--whenever it is founded!

Everything has gone on well with us, I am glad to say.  Teuta is in
splendid health, though she has--but only very lately--practically given
up going on her own aeroplane.  It was, I know, a great sacrifice to
make, just as she had become an expert at it.  They say here that she is
one of the best drivers in the Blue Mountains--and that is in the world,
for we have made that form of movement our own.  Ever since we found the
pitch-blende pockets in the Great Tunnel, and discovered the simple
process of extracting the radium from it, we have gone on by leaps and
bounds.  When first Teuta told me she would "aero" no more for a while, I
thought she was wise, and backed her up in it: for driving an aeroplane
is trying work and hard on the nerves.  I only learned then the reason
for her caution--the usual one of a young wife.  That was three months
ago, and only this morning she told me she would not go sailing in the
air, even with me, till she could do so "without risk"--she did not mean
risk to herself.  Aunt Janet knew what she meant, and counselled her
strongly to stick to her resolution.  So for the next few months I am to
do my air-sailing alone.

The public works which we began immediately after the Coronation are
going strong.  We began at the very beginning on an elaborate system.
The first thing was to adequately fortify the Blue Mouth.  Whilst the
fortifications were being constructed we kept all the warships in the
gulf.  But when the point of safety was reached, we made the ships do
sentry-go along the coast, whilst we trained men for service at sea.  It
is our plan to take by degrees all the young men and teach them this
wise, so that at the end the whole population shall be trained for sea as
well as for land.  And as we are teaching them the airship service, too,
they will be at home in all the elements--except fire, of course, though
if that should become a necessity, we shall tackle it too!

We started the Great Tunnel at the farthest inland point of the Blue
Mouth, and ran it due east at an angle of 45 degrees, so that, when
complete, it would go right through the first line of hills, coming out
on the plateau Plazac.  The plateau is not very wide--half a mile at
most--and the second tunnel begins on the eastern side of it.  This new
tunnel is at a smaller angle, as it has to pierce the second hill--a
mountain this time.  When it comes out on the east side of that, it will
tap the real productive belt.  Here it is that our hardwood-trees are
finest, and where the greatest mineral deposits are found.  This plateau
is of enormous length, and runs north arid south round the great bulk of
the central mountain, so that in time, when we put up a circular railway,
we can bring, at a merely nominal cost, all sorts of material up or down.
It is on this level that we have built the great factories for war
material.  We are tunnelling into the mountains, where are the great
deposits of coal.  We run the trucks in and out on the level, and can get
perfect ventilation with little cost or labour.  Already we are mining
all the coal which we consume within our own confines, and we can, if we
wish, within a year export largely.  The great slopes of these tunnels
give us the necessary aid of specific gravity, and as we carry an endless
water-supply in great tubes that way also, we can do whatever we wish by
hydraulic power.  As one by one the European and Asiatic nations began to
reduce their war preparations, we took over their disbanded workmen
though our agents, so that already we have a productive staff of skilled
workmen larger than anywhere else in the world.  I think myself that we
were fortunate in being able to get ahead so fast with our preparations
for war manufacture, for if some of the "Great Powers," as they call
themselves, knew the measure of our present production, they would
immediately try to take active measures against us.  In such case we
should have to fight them, which would delay us.  But if we can have
another year untroubled, we shall, so far as war material is concerned,
be able to defy any nation in the world.  And if the time may only come
peacefully till we have our buildings and machinery complete, we can
prepare war-stores and implements for the whole Balkan nations.  And
then--But that is a dream.  We shall know in good time.

In the meantime all goes well.  The cannon foundries are built and
active.  We are already beginning to turn out finished work.  Of course,
our first guns are not very large, but they are good.  The big guns, and
especially siege-guns, will come later.  And when the great extensions
are complete, and the boring and wire-winding machines are in working
order, we can go merrily on.  I suppose that by that time the whole of
the upper plateau will be like a manufacturing town--at any rate, we have
plenty of raw material to hand.  The haematite mines seem to be
inexhaustible, and as the raising of the ore is cheap and easy by means
of our extraordinary water-power, and as coal comes down to the plateau
by its own gravity on the cable-line, we have natural advantages which
exist hardly anywhere else in the world--certainly not all together, as
here.  That bird's eye view of the Blue Mouth which we had from the
aeroplane when Teuta saw that vision of the future has not been in vain.
The aeroplane works are having a splendid output.  The aeroplane is a
large and visible product; there is no mistaking when it is there!  We
have already a large and respectable aerial fleet.  The factories for
explosives are, of course, far away in bare valleys, where accidental
effects are minimized.  So, too, are the radium works, wherein unknown
dangers may lurk.  The turbines in the tunnel give us all the power we
want at present, and, later on, when the new tunnel, which we call the
"water tunnel," which is already begun, is complete, the available power
will be immense.  All these works are bringing up our shipping, and we
are in great hopes for the future.

So much for our material prosperity.  But with it comes a larger life and
greater hopes.  The stress of organizing and founding these great works
is practically over.  As they are not only self-supporting, but largely
productive, all anxiety in the way of national expenditure is minimized.
And, more than all, I am able to give my unhampered attention to those
matters of even more than national importance on which the ultimate
development, if not the immediate strength, of our country must depend.

I am well into the subject of a great Balkan Federation.  This, it turns
out, has for long been the dream of Teuta's life, as also that of the
present Archimandrite of Plazac, her father, who, since I last touched
this journal, having taken on himself a Holy Life, was, by will of the
Church, the Monks, and the People, appointed to that great office on the
retirement of Petrof Vlastimir.

Such a Federation had long been in the air.  For myself, I had seen its
inevitableness from the first.  The modern aggressions of the Dual
Nation, interpreted by her past history with regard to Italy, pointed
towards the necessity of such a protective measure.  And now, when Servia
and Bulgaria were used as blinds to cover her real movements to
incorporate with herself as established the provinces, once Turkish,
which had been entrusted to her temporary protection by the Treaty of
Berlin; when it would seem that Montenegro was to be deprived for all
time of the hope of regaining the Bocche di Cattaro, which she had a
century ago won, and held at the point of the sword, until a Great Power
had, under a wrong conviction, handed it over to her neighbouring
Goliath; when the Sandjack of Novi-Bazar was threatened with the fate
which seemed to have already overtaken Bosnia and Herzegovina; when
gallant little Montenegro was already shut out from the sea by the
octopus-like grip of Dalmatia crouching along her western shore; when
Turkey was dwindling down to almost ineptitude; when Greece was almost a
byword, and when Albania as a nation--though still nominally subject--was
of such unimpaired virility that there were great possibilities of her
future, it was imperative that something must happen if the Balkan race
was not to be devoured piecemeal by her northern neighbours.  To the end
of ultimate protection I found most of them willing to make defensive
alliance.

And as the true defence consists in judicious attack, I have no doubt
that an alliance so based must ultimately become one for all purposes.
Albania was the most difficult to win to the scheme, as her own
complications with her suzerain, combined with the pride and
suspiciousness of her people, made approach a matter of extreme caution.
It was only possible when I could induce her rulers to see that, no
matter how great her pride and valour, the magnitude of northern advance,
if unchecked, must ultimately overwhelm her.

I own that this map-making was nervous work, for I could not shut my eyes
to the fact that German lust of enlargement lay behind Austria's advance.
At and before that time expansion was the dominant idea of the three
Great Powers of Central Europe.  Russia went eastward, hoping to gather
to herself the rich north-eastern provinces of China, till ultimately she
should dominate the whole of Northern Europe and Asia from the Gulf of
Finland to the Yellow Sea.  Germany wished to link the North Sea to the
Mediterranean by her own territory, and thus stand as a flawless barrier
across Europe from north to south.

When Nature should have terminated the headship of the Empire-Kingdom,
she, as natural heir, would creep southward through the German-speaking
provinces.  Thus Austria, of course kept in ignorance of her neighbour's
ultimate aims, had to extend towards the south.  She had been barred in
her western movement by the rise of the Irredentist party in Italy, and
consequently had to withdraw behind the frontiers of Carinthia, Carniola,
and Istria.

My own dream of the new map was to make "Balka"--the Balkan
Federation--take in ultimately all south of a line drawn from the Isle of
Serpents to Aquileia.  There would--must--be difficulties in the carrying
out of such a scheme.  Of course, it involved Austria giving up Dalmatia,
Istria, and Sclavonia, as well as a part of Croatia and the Hungarian
Banat.  On the contrary, she might look for centuries of peace in the
south.  But it would make for peace so strongly that each of the States
impinging on it would find it worth while to make a considerable
sacrifice to have it effected.  To its own integers it would offer a
lasting settlement of interests which at present conflicted, and a share
in a new world-power.  Each of these integers would be absolutely
self-governing and independent, being only united for purposes of mutual
good.  I did not despair that even Turkey and Greece, recognizing that
benefit and safety would ensue without the destruction or even minimizing
of individuality, would, sooner or later, come into the Federation.  The
matter is already so far advanced that within a month the various rulers
of the States involved are to have a secret and informal meeting.
Doubtless some larger plan and further action will be then evolved.  It
will be an anxious time for all in this zone--and outside it--till this
matter is all settled.  In any case, the manufacture of war material will
go on until it is settled, one way or another.



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                          _March_ 6, 1908.

I breathe more freely.  The meeting has taken place here at Vissarion.
Nominal cause of meeting: a hunting-party in the Blue Mountains.  Not any
formal affair.  Not a Chancellor or Secretary of State or Diplomatist of
any sort present.  All headquarters.  It was, after all, a real
hunting-party.  Good sportsmen, plenty of game, lots of beaters,
everything organized properly, and an effective tally of results.  I
think we all enjoyed ourselves in the matter of sport; and as the
political result was absolute unanimity of purpose and intention, there
could be no possible cause of complaint.

So it is all decided.  Everything is pacific.  There is not a suggestion
even of war, revolt, or conflicting purpose of any kind.  We all go on
exactly as we are doing for another year, pursuing our own individual
objects, just as at present.  But we are all to see that in our own
households order prevails.  All that is supposed to be effective is to be
kept in good working order, and whatever is, at present, not adequate to
possibilities is to be made so.  This is all simply protective and
defensive.  We understand each other.  But if any hulking stranger should
undertake to interfere in our domestic concerns, we shall all unite on
the instant to keep things as we wish them to remain.  We shall be ready.
Alfred's maxim of Peace shall be once more exemplified.  In the meantime
the factories shall work overtime in our own mountains, and the output
shall be for the general good of our special community--the bill to be
settled afterwards amicably.  There can hardly be any difference of
opinion about that, as the others will be the consumers of our surplus
products.  We are the producers, who produce for ourselves first, and
then for the limited market of those within the Ring.  As we undertake to
guard our own frontiers--sea and land--and are able to do so, the goods
are to be warehoused in the Blue Mountains until required--if at all--for
participation in the markets of the world, and especially in the European
market.  If all goes well and the markets are inactive, the goods shall
be duly delivered to the purchasers as arranged.

So much for the purely mercantile aspect.



THE VOIVODIN JANET MACKELPIE'S NOTES.


                                                           _May_ 21, 1908.

As Rupert began to neglect his Journal when he was made a King, so, too,
I find in myself a tendency to leave writing to other people.  But one
thing I shall not be content to leave to others--little Rupert.  The baby
of Rupert and Teuta is much too precious a thing to be spoken of except
with love, quite independent of the fact that he will be, in natural
course, a King!  So I have promised Teuta that whatever shall be put into
this record of the first King of the Sent Leger Dynasty relating to His
Royal Highness the Crown Prince shall only appear in either her hand or
my own.  And she has deputed the matter to me.

Our dear little Prince arrived punctually and in perfect condition.  The
angels that carried him evidently took the greatest care of him, and
before they left him they gave him dower of all their best.  He is a
dear!  Like both his father and his mother, and that says everything.  My
own private opinion is that he is a born King!  He does not know what
fear is, and he thinks more of everyone else than he does of his dear
little self.  And if those things do not show a truly royal nature, I do
not know what does . . .

Teuta has read this.  She held up a warning finger, and said:

"Aunt Janet dear, that is all true.  He is a dear, and a King, and an
angel!  But we mustn't have too much about him just yet.  This book is to
be about Rupert.  So our little man can only be what we shall call a
corollary."  And so it is.

I should mention here that the book is Teuta's idea.  Before little
Rupert came she controlled herself wonderfully, doing only what was
thought best for her under the circumstances.  As I could see that it
would be a help for her to have some quiet occupation which would
interest her without tiring her, I looked up (with his permission, of
course) all Rupert's old letters and diaries, and journals and
reports--all that I had kept for him during his absences on his
adventures.  At first I was a little afraid they might harm her, for at
times she got so excited over some things that I had to caution her.
Here again came in her wonderful self-control.  I think the most soothing
argument I used with her was to point out that the dear boy had come
through all the dangers safely, and was actually with us, stronger and
nobler than ever.

After we had read over together the whole matter several times--for it
was practically new to me too, and I got nearly as excited as she was,
though I have known him so much longer--we came to the conclusion that
this particular volume would have to be of selected matter.  There is
enough of Rupert's work to make a lot of volumes and we have an ambitious
literary project of some day publishing an _edition de luxe_ of his whole
collected works.  It will be a rare showing amongst the works of Kings.
But this is to be all about himself, so that in the future it may serve
as a sort of backbone of his personal history.

By-and-by we came to a part when we had to ask him questions; and he was
so interested in Teuta's work--he is really bound up body and soul in his
beautiful wife, and no wonder--that we had to take him into full
confidence.  He promised he would help us all he could by giving us the
use of his later journals, and such letters and papers as he had kept
privately.  He said he would make one condition--I use his own words: "As
you two dear women are to be my editors, you must promise to put in
everything exactly as I wrote it.  It will not do to have any fake about
this.  I do not wish anything foolish or egotistical toned down out of
affection for me.  It was all written in sincerity, and if I had faults,
they must not be hidden.  If it is to be history, it must be true
history, even if it gives you and me or any of us away."

So we promised.

He also said that, as Sir Edward Bingham Trent, Bart.--as he is now--was
sure to have some matter which we should like, he would write and ask him
to send such to us.  He also said that Mr. Ernest Roger Halbard Melton,
of Humcroft, Salop (he always gives this name and address in full, which
is his way of showing contempt), would be sure to have some relevant
matter, and that he would have him written to on the subject.  This he
did.  The Chancellor wrote him in his most grandiloquent style.   Mr. E.
R. H. Melton, of H., S., replied by return post.  His letter is a
document which speaks for itself:

                                                          HUMCROFT, SALOP,
                                                           _May_ 30, 1908.

    MY DEAR COUSIN KING RUPERT,

    I am honoured by the request made on your behalf by the Lord High
    Chancellor of your kingdom that I should make a literary contribution
    to the volume which my cousin, Queen Teuta, is, with the help of your
    former governess, Miss MacKelpie, compiling.  I am willing to do so,
    as you naturally wish to have in that work some contemporary record
    made by the Head of the House of Melton, with which you are
    connected, though only on the distaff side.  It is a natural ambition
    enough, even on the part of a barbarian--or perhaps
    semi-barbarian--King, and far be it from me, as Head of the House, to
    deny you such a coveted privilege.  Perhaps you may not know that I
    am now Head of the House; my father died three days ago.  I offered
    my mother the use of the Dower House--to the incumbency of which,
    indeed, she is entitled by her marriage settlement.  But she
    preferred to go to live at her seat, Carfax, in Kent.  She went this
    morning after the funeral.  In letting you have the use of my
    manuscript I make only one stipulation, but that I expect to be
    rigidly adhered to.  It is that all that I have written be put in the
    book _in extenso_.  I do not wish any record of mine to be garbled to
    suit other ends than those ostensible, or whatever may be to the
    honour of myself or my House to be burked.  I dare say you have
    noticed, my dear Rupert, that the compilers of family histories
    often, through jealousy, alter matter that they are allowed to use so
    as to suit their own purpose or minister to their own vanity.  I
    think it right to tell you that I have had a certified copy made by
    Petter and Galpin, the law stationers, so that I shall be able to
    verify whether my stipulation has been honourably observed.  I am
    having the book, which is naturally valuable, carefully packed, and
    shall have it forwarded to Sir Edward Bingham Trent, Baronet (which
    he now is--Heaven save the mark!), the Attorney.  Please see that he
    returns it to me, and in proper order.  He is not to publish for
    himself anything in it about him.  A man of that class is apt to
    advertise the fact of anyone of distinction taking any notice of him.
    I would bring out the MS. to you myself, and stay for a while with
    you for some sport, only your lot--subjects I suppose you call
    them!--are such bounders that a gentleman's life is hardly safe
    amongst them.  I never met anyone who had so poor an appreciation of
    a joke as they have.  By the way, how is Teuta?  She is one of them.
    I heard all about the hatching business.  I hope the kid is all
    right.  This is only a word in your ear, so don't get cocky, old son.
    I am open to a godfathership.  Think of that, Hedda!  Of course, if
    the other godfather and the godmother are up to the mark; I don't
    want to have to boost up the whole lot!  Savvy?  Kiss Teuta and the
    kid for me.  I must have the boy over here for a bit later on--when
    he is presentable, and has learned not to be a nuisance.  It will be
    good for him to see something of a real first-class English country
    house like Humcroft.  To a person only accustomed to rough ways and
    meagre living its luxury will make a memory which will serve in time
    as an example to be aimed at.  I shall write again soon.  Don't
    hesitate to ask any favour which I may be able to confer on you.  So
    long!

                                                 Your affectionate cousin,
                                              ERNEST ROGER HALBARD MELTON.

_Extract from Letter from E. Bingham Trent to Queen Teuta of the Blue
Mountains_.

    . . . So I thought the best way to serve that appalling cad would be
    to take him at his word, and put in his literary contribution in
    full.  I have had made and attested a copy of his "Record," as he
    calls it, so as to save you trouble.  But I send the book itself,
    because I am afraid that unless you see his words in his own writing,
    you will not believe that he or anyone else ever penned seriously a
    document so incriminating.  I am sure he must have forgotten what he
    had written, for even such a dull dog as he is could never have made
    public such a thing knowingly. . . Such a nature has its revenges on
    itself.  In this case the officers of revenge are his _ipsissima
    verba_.



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                       _February_ 1, 1909.

All is now well in train.  When the Czar of Russia, on being asked by the
Sclavs (as was meet) to be the referee in the "Balkan Settlement,"
declined on the ground that he was himself by inference an interested
party, it was unanimously agreed by the Balkan rulers that the Western
King should be asked to arbitrate, as all concerned had perfect
confidence in his wisdom, as well as his justice.  To their wish he
graciously assented.  The matter has now been for more than six months in
his hands, and he has taken endless trouble to obtain full information.
He has now informed us through his Chancellor that his decision is almost
ready, and will be communicated as soon as possible.

We have another hunting-party at Vissarion next week.  Teuta is looking
forward to it with extraordinary interest.  She hopes then to present to
our brothers of the Balkans our little son, and she is eager to know if
they endorse her mother-approval of him.



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                         _April_ 15, 1909.

The arbitrator's decision has been communicated to us through the
Chancellor of the Western King, who brought it to us himself as a special
act of friendliness.  It met with the enthusiastic approval of all.  The
Premier remained with us during the progress of the hunting-party, which
was one of the most joyous occasions ever known.  We are all of good
heart, for the future of the Balkan races is now assured.  The
strife--internal and external--of a thousand years has ceased, and we
look with hope for a long and happy time.  The Chancellor brought
messages of grace and courtliness and friendliness to all.  And when I,
as spokesman of the party, asked him if we might convey a request of His
Majesty that he would honour us by attending the ceremony of making known
formally the Balkan Settlement, he answered that the King had authorized
him to say that he would, if such were wished by us, gladly come; and
that if he should come, he would attend with a fleet as an escort.  The
Chancellor also told me from himself that it might be possible to have
other nationalities represented on such a great occasion by Ambassadors
and even fleets, though the monarchs themselves might not be able to
attend.  He hinted that it might be well if I put the matter in train.
(He evidently took it for granted that, though I was only one of several,
the matter rested with me--possibly he chose me as the one to whom to
make the confidence, as I was born a stranger.)  As we talked it over, he
grew more enthusiastic, and finally said that, as the King was taking the
lead, doubtless all the nations of the earth friendly to him would like
to take a part in the ceremony.  So it is likely to turn out practically
an international ceremony of a unique kind.  Teuta will love it, and we
shall all do what we can.



JANET MACKELPIE'S NOTES.


                                                           _June_ 1, 1909.

Our dear Teuta is full of the forthcoming celebration of the Balkan
Federation, which is to take place this day month, although I must say,
for myself, that the ceremony is attaining to such dimensions that I am
beginning to have a sort of vague fear of some kind.  It almost seems
uncanny.  Rupert is working unceasingly--has been for some time.  For
weeks past he seems to have been out day and night on his aeroplane,
going through and round over the country arranging matters, and seeing
for himself that what has been arranged is being done.  Uncle Colin is
always about, too, and so is Admiral Rooke.  But now Teuta is beginning
to go with Rupert.  That girl is simply fearless--just like Rupert.  And
they both seem anxious that little Rupert shall be the same.  Indeed, he
is the same.  A few mornings ago Rupert and Teuta were about to start
just after dawn from the top of the Castle.  Little Rupert was there--he
is always awake early and as bright as a bee.  I was holding him in my
arms, and when his mother leant over to kiss him good-bye, he held out
his arms to her in a way that said as plainly as if he had spoken, "Take
me with you."

She looked appealingly at Rupert, who nodded, and said: "All right.  Take
him, darling.  He will have to learn some day, and the sooner the
better."  The baby, looking eagerly from one to the other with the same
questioning in his eyes as there is sometimes in the eyes of a kitten or
a puppy--but, of course, with an eager soul behind it--saw that he was
going, and almost leaped into his mother's arms.  I think she had
expected him to come, for she took a little leather dress from Margareta,
his nurse, and, flushing with pride, began to wrap him in it.  When
Teuta, holding him in her arms, stepped on the aeroplane, and took her
place in the centre behind Rupert, the young men of the Crown Prince's
Guard raised a cheer, amid which Rupert pulled the levers, and they
glided off into the dawn.

The Crown Prince's Guard was established by the mountaineers themselves
the day of his birth.  Ten of the biggest and most powerful and cleverest
young men of the nation were chosen, and were sworn in with a very
impressive ceremony to guard the young Prince.  They were to so arrange
and order themselves and matters generally that two at least of them
should always have him, or the place in which he was, within their sight.
They all vowed that the last of their lives should go before harm came to
him.  Of course, Teuta understood, and so did Rupert.  And these young
men are the persons most privileged in the whole Castle.  They are dear
boys, every one of them, and we are all fond of them and respect them.
They simply idolize the baby.

Ever since that morning little Rupert has, unless it is at a time
appointed for his sleeping, gone in his mother's arms.  I think in any
other place there would be some State remonstrance at the whole royal
family being at once and together in a dangerous position, but in the
Blue Mountains danger and fear are not thought of--indeed, they can
hardly be in their terminology.  And I really think the child enjoys it
even more than his parents.  He is just like a little bird that has found
the use of his wings.  Bless him!

I find that even I have to study Court ritual a little.  So many
nationalities are to be represented at the ceremony of the "Balkan
Settlement," and so many Kings and Princes and notabilities of all kinds
are coming, that we must all take care not to make any mistakes.  The
Press alone would drive anyone silly.  Rupert and Teuta come and sit with
me sometimes in the evening when we are all too tired to work, and they
rest themselves by talking matters over.  Rupert says that there will be
over five hundred reporters, and that the applications for permission are
coming in so fast that there may be a thousand when the day comes.  Last
night he stopped in the middle of speaking of it, and said:

"I have an inspiration!  Fancy a thousand journalists,--each wanting to
get ahead of the rest, and all willing to invoke the Powers of Evil for
exclusive information!  The only man to look after this department is
Rooke.  He knows how to deal with men, and as we have already a large
staff to look after the journalistic guests, he can be at the head, and
appoint his own deputies to act for him.  Somewhere and sometime the
keeping the peace will be a matter of nerve and resolution, and Rooke is
the man for the job."

We were all concerned about one thing, naturally important in the eyes of
a woman: What robes was Teuta to wear?  In the old days, when there were
Kings and Queens, they doubtless wore something gorgeous or impressive;
but whatever it was that they wore has gone to dust centuries ago, and
there were no illustrated papers in those primitive days.  Teuta was
talking to me eagerly, with her dear beautiful brows all wrinkled, when
Rupert who was reading a bulky document of some kind, looked up and said:

"Of course, darling, you will wear your Shroud?"

"Capital!" she said, clapping her hands like a joyous child.  "The very
thing, and our people will like it."

I own that for a moment I was dismayed.  It was a horrible test of a
woman's love and devotion.  At a time when she was entertaining Kings and
notabilities in her own house--and be sure they would all be decked in
their finery--to have to appear in such a garment!  A plain thing with
nothing even pretty, let alone gorgeous, about it!  I expressed my views
to Rupert, for I feared that Teuta might be disappointed, though she
might not care to say so; but before he could say a word Teuta answered:

"Oh, thank you so much, dear!  I should love that above everything, but I
did not like to suggest it, lest you should think me arrogant or
presuming; for, indeed, Rupert, I am very proud of it, and of the way our
people look on it."

"Why not?" said Rupert, in his direct way.  "It is a thing for us all to
be proud of; the nation has already adopted it as a national emblem--our
emblem of courage and devotion and patriotism, which will always, I hope,
be treasured beyond price by the men and women of our Dynasty, the
Nation, that is--of the Nation that is to be."

Later on in the evening we had a strange endorsement of the national
will.  A "People's Deputation" of mountaineers, without any official
notice or introduction, arrived at the Castle late in the evening in the
manner established by Rupert's "Proclamation of Freedom," wherein all
citizens were entitled to send a deputation to the King, at will and in
private, on any subject of State importance.  This deputation was
composed of seventeen men, one selected from each political section, so
that the body as a whole represented the entire nation.  They were of all
sorts of social rank and all degrees of fortune, but they were mainly "of
the people."  They spoke hesitatingly--possibly because Teuta, or even
because I, was present--but with a manifest earnestness.  They made but
one request--that the Queen should, on the great occasion of the Balkan
Federation, wear as robes of State the Shroud that they loved to see her
in.  The spokesman, addressing the Queen, said in tones of rugged
eloquence:

"This is a matter, Your Majesty, that the women naturally have a say in,
so we have, of course, consulted them.  They have discussed the matter by
themselves, and then with us, and they are agreed without a flaw that it
will be good for the Nation and for Womankind that you do this thing.
You have shown to them, and to the world at large, what women should do,
what they can do, and they want to make, in memory of your great act, the
Shroud a garment of pride and honour for women who have deserved well of
their country.  In the future it can be a garment to be worn only by
privileged women who have earned the right.  But they hope, and we hope
with them, that on this occasion of our Nation taking the lead before the
eyes of the world, all our women may wear it on that day as a means of
showing overtly their willingness to do their duty, even to the death.
And so"--here he turned to the King--"Rupert, we trust that Her Majesty
Queen Teuta will understand that in doing as the women of the Blue
Mountains wish, she will bind afresh to the Queen the loyal devotion
which she won from them as Voivodin.  Henceforth and for all time the
Shroud shall be a dress of honour in our Land."

Teuta looked all ablaze with love and pride and devotion.  Stars in her
eyes shone like white fire as she assured them of the granting of their
request.  She finished her little speech:

"I feared that if I carried out my own wish, it might look arrogant, but
Rupert has expressed the same wish, and now I feel that I am free to wear
that dress which brought me to you and to Rupert"--here she beamed on
him, and took his hand--"fortified as I am by your wishes and the command
of my lord the King."

Rupert took her in his arms and kissed her fondly before them all,
saying:

"Tell your wives, my brothers, and the rest of the Blue Mountain women,
that that is the answer of the husband who loves and honours his wife.
All the world shall see at the ceremony of the Federation of Balka that
we men love and honour the women who are loyal and can die for duty.
And, men of the Blue Mountains, some day before long we shall organize
that great idea, and make it a permanent thing--that the Order of the
Shroud is the highest guerdon that a noble-hearted woman can wear."

Teuta disappeared for a few moments, and came back with the Crown Prince
in her arms.  Everyone present asked to be allowed to kiss him, which
they did kneeling.



THE FEDERATION BALKA.


_By the Correspondents of_ "_Free America_."

The Editors of _Free America_ have thought it well to put in consecutive
order the reports and descriptions of their Special Correspondents, of
whom there were present no less than eight.  Not a word they wrote is
omitted, but the various parts of their reports are placed in different
order, so that, whilst nothing which any of them recorded is left out,
the reader may be able to follow the proceedings from the various points
of view of the writers who had the most favourable opportunity of moment.
In so large an assemblage of journalists--there were present over a
thousand--they could not all be present in one place; so our men, in
consultation amongst themselves, arranged to scatter, so as to cover the
whole proceeding from the various "coigns of vantage," using their skill
and experience in selecting these points.  One was situated on the summit
of the steel-clad tower in the entrance to the Blue Mouth; another on the
"Press-boat," which was moored alongside King Rupert's armoured yacht,
_The Lady_, whereon were gathered the various Kings and rulers of the
Balkan States, all of whom were in the Federation; another was in a swift
torpedo-boat, with a roving commission to cruise round the harbour as
desired; another took his place on the top of the great mountain which
overlooks Plazac, and so had a bird's-eye view of the whole scene of
operations; two others were on the forts to right and left of the Blue
Mouth; another was posted at the entrance to the Great Tunnel which runs
from the water level right up through the mountains to the plateau, where
the mines and factories are situate; another had the privilege of a place
on an aeroplane, which went everywhere and saw everything.  This
aeroplane was driven by an old Special Correspondent of _Free America_,
who had been a chum of our Special in the Japanese and Russian War, and
who has taken service on the Blue Mountain _Official Gazette_.

                                                                   PLAZAC,
                                                          _June_ 30, 1909.

Two days before the time appointed for the ceremony the guests of the
Land of the Blue Mountains began to arrive.  The earlier comers were
mostly the journalists who had come from almost over the whole inhabited
world.  King Rupert, who does things well, had made a camp for their
exclusive use.  There was a separate tent for each--of course, a small
one, as there were over a thousand journalists--but there were big tents
for general use scattered about--refectories, reading and writing rooms,
a library, idle rooms for rest, etc.  In the rooms for reading and
writing, which were the work-rooms for general use, were newspapers, the
latest attainable from all over the world, Blue-Books, guides,
directories, and all such aids to work as forethought could arrange.
There was for this special service a body of some hundreds of capable
servants in special dress and bearing identification numbers--in fact,
King Rupert "did us fine," to use a slang phrase of pregnant meaning.

There were other camps for special service, all of them well arranged,
and with plenty of facility for transport.  Each of the Federating
Monarchs had a camp of his own, in which he had erected a magnificent
pavilion.  For the Western King, who had acted as Arbitrator in the
matter of the Federation, a veritable palace had been built by King
Rupert--a sort of Aladdin's palace it must have been, for only a few
weeks ago the place it occupied was, I was told, only primeval
wilderness.  King Rupert and his Queen, Teuta, had a pavilion like the
rest of the Federators of Balka, but infinitely more modest, both in size
and adornments.

Everywhere were guards of the Blue Mountains, armed only with the
"handjar," which is the national weapon.  They wore the national dress,
but so arranged in colour and accoutrement that the general air of
uniformity took the place of a rigid uniform.  There must have been at
least seventy or eighty thousand of them.

The first day was one of investigation of details by the visitors.
During the second day the retinues of the great Federators came.  Some of
these retinues were vast.  For instance, the Soldan (though only just
become a Federator) sent of one kind or another more than a thousand men.
A brave show they made, for they are fine men, and drilled to perfection.
As they swaggered along, singly or in mass, with their gay jackets and
baggy trousers, their helmets surmounted by the golden crescent, they
looked a foe not to be despised.  Landreck Martin, the Nestor of
journalists, said to me, as we stood together looking at them:

"To-day we witness a new departure in Blue Mountain history.  This is the
first occasion for a thousand years that so large a Turkish body has
entered the Blue Mountains with a reasonable prospect of ever getting out
again."

                                                           _July_ 1, 1909.

To-day, the day appointed for the ceremony, was auspiciously fine, even
for the Blue Mountains, where at this time of year the weather is nearly
always fine.  They are early folk in the Blue Mountains, but to-day
things began to hum before daybreak.  There were bugle-calls all over the
place--everything here is arranged by calls of musical
instruments--trumpets, or bugles, or drums (if, indeed, the drum can be
called a musical instrument)--or by lights, if it be after dark.  We
journalists were all ready; coffee and bread-and-butter had been
thoughtfully served early in our sleeping-tents, and an elaborate
breakfast was going on all the time in the refectory pavilions.  We had a
preliminary look round, and then there was a sort of general pause for
breakfast.  We took advantage of it, and attacked the sumptuous--indeed,
memorable--meal which was served for us.

The ceremony was to commence at noon, but at ten o'clock the whole place
was astir--not merely beginning to move, but actually moving; everybody
taking their places for the great ceremony.  As noon drew near, the
excitement was intense and prolonged.  One by one the various signatories
to the Federation began to assemble.  They all came by sea; such of them
as had sea-boards of their own having their fleets around them.  Such as
had no fleets of their own were attended by at least one of the Blue
Mountain ironclads.  And I am bound to say that I never in my life saw
more dangerous craft than these little warships of King Rupert of the
Blue Mountains.  As they entered the Blue Mouth each ship took her
appointed station, those which carried the signatories being close
together in an isolated group in a little bay almost surrounded by high
cliffs in the farthest recesses of the mighty harbour.  King Rupert's
armoured yacht all the time lay close inshore, hard by the mouth of the
Great Tunnel which runs straight into the mountain from a wide plateau,
partly natural rock, partly built up with mighty blocks of stone.  Here
it is, I am told, that the inland products are brought down to the modern
town of Plazac.  Just as the clocks were chiming the half-hour before
noon this yacht glided out into the expanse of the "Mouth."  Behind her
came twelve great barges, royally decked, and draped each in the colour
of the signatory nation.  On each of these the ruler entered with his
guard, and was carried to Rupert's yacht, he going on the bridge, whilst
his suite remained on the lower deck.  In the meantime whole fleets had
been appearing on the southern horizon; the nations were sending their
maritime quota to the christening of "Balka"!  In such wonderful order as
can only be seen with squadrons of fighting ships, the mighty throng
swept into the Blue Mouth, and took up their stations in groups.  The
only armament of a Great Power now missing was that of the Western King.
But there was time.  Indeed, as the crowd everywhere began to look at
their watches a long line of ships began to spread up northward from the
Italian coast.  They came at great speed--nearly twenty knots.  It was a
really wonderful sight--fifty of the finest ships in the world; the very
latest expression of naval giants, each seemingly typical of its
class--Dreadnoughts, cruisers, destroyers.  They came in a wedge, with
the King's yacht flying the Royal Standard the apex.  Every ship of the
squadron bore a red ensign long enough to float from the masthead to the
water.  From the armoured tower in the waterway one could see the myriad
of faces--white stars on both land and sea--for the great harbour was now
alive with ships and each and all of them alive with men.

Suddenly, without any direct cause, the white masses became
eclipsed--everyone had turned round, and was looking the other way.  I
looked across the bay and up the mountain behind--a mighty mountain,
whose slopes run up to the very sky, ridge after ridge seeming like
itself a mountain.  Far away on the very top the standard of the Blue
Mountains was run up on a mighty Flagstaff which seemed like a shaft of
light.  It was two hundred feet high, and painted white, and as at the
distance the steel stays were invisible, it towered up in lonely
grandeur.  At its foot was a dark mass grouped behind a white space,
which I could not make out till I used my field-glasses.

Then I knew it was King Rupert and the Queen in the midst of a group of
mountaineers.  They were on the aero station behind the platform of the
aero, which seemed to shine--shine, not glitter--as though it were
overlaid with plates of gold.

Again the faces looked west.  The Western Squadron was drawing near to
the entrance of the Blue Mouth.  On the bridge of the yacht stood the
Western King in uniform of an Admiral, and by him his Queen in a dress of
royal purple, splendid with gold.  Another glance at the mountain-top
showed that it had seemed to become alive.  A whole park of artillery
seemed to have suddenly sprung to life, round each its crew ready for
action.  Amongst the group at the foot of the Flagstaff we could
distinguish King Rupert; his vast height and bulk stood out from and
above all round him.  Close to him was a patch of white, which we
understood to be Queen Teuta, whom the Blue Mountaineers simply adore.

By this time the armoured yacht, bearing all the signatories to "Balka"
(excepting King Rupert), had moved out towards the entrance, and lay
still and silent, waiting the coming of the Royal Arbitrator, whose whole
squadron simultaneously slowed down, and hardly drifted in the seething
water of their backing engines.

When the flag which was in the yacht's prow was almost opposite the
armoured fort, the Western King held up a roll of vellum handed to him by
one of his officers.  We onlookers held our breath, for in an instant was
such a scene as we can never hope to see again.

At the raising of the Western King's hand, a gun was fired away on the
top of the mountain where rose the mighty Flagstaff with the standard of
the Blue Mountains.  Then came the thunder of salute from the guns,
bright flashes and reports, which echoed down the hillsides in
never-ending sequence.  At the first gun, by some trick of signalling,
the flag of the Federated "Balka" floated out from the top of the
Flagstaff, which had been mysteriously raised, and flew above that of the
Blue Mountains.

At the same moment the figures of Rupert and Teuta sank; they were taking
their places on the aeroplane.  An instant after, like a great golden
bird, it seemed to shoot out into the air, and then, dipping its head,
dropped downward at an obtuse angle.  We could see the King and Queen
from time waist upwards--the King in Blue Mountain dress of green; the
Queen, wrapped in her white Shroud, holding her baby on her breast.  When
far out from the mountain-top and over the Blue Mouth, the wings and tail
of the great bird-like machine went up, and the aero dropped like a
stone, till it was only some few hundred feet over the water.  Then the
wings and tail went down, but with diminishing speed.  Below the expanse
of the plane the King and Queen were now seen seated together on the tiny
steering platform, which seemed to have been lowered; she sat behind her
husband, after the manner of matrons of the Blue Mountains.  That coming
of that aeroplane was the most striking episode of all this wonderful
day.

After floating for a few seconds, the engines began to work, whilst the
planes moved back to their normal with beautiful simultaneity.  There was
a golden aero finding its safety in gliding movement.  At the same time
the steering platform was rising, so that once more the occupants were
not far below, but above the plane.  They were now only about a hundred
feet above the water, moving from the far end of the Blue Mouth towards
the entrance in the open space between the two lines of the fighting
ships of the various nationalities, all of which had by now their yards
manned--a manoeuvre which had begun at the firing of the first gun on the
mountain-top.  As the aero passed along, all the seamen began to cheer--a
cheering which they kept up till the King and Queen had come so close to
the Western King's vessel that the two Kings and Queens could greet each
other.  The wind was now beginning to blow westward from the
mountain-top, and it took the sounds towards the armoured fort, so that
at moments we could distinguish the cheers of the various nationalities,
amongst which, more keen than the others, came the soft "Ban Zai!" of the
Japanese.

King Rupert, holding his steering levers, sat like a man of marble.
Behind him his beautiful wife, clad in her Shroud, and holding in her
arms the young Crown Prince, seemed like a veritable statue.

The aero, guided by Rupert's unerring hand, lit softly on the after-deck
of the Western King's yacht; and King Rupert, stepping on deck, lifted
from her seat Queen Teuta with her baby in her arms.  It was only when
the Blue Mountain King stood amongst other men that one could realize his
enormous stature.  He stood literally head and shoulders over every other
man present.

Whilst the aeroplane was giving up its burden, the Western King and his
Queen were descending from the bridge.  The host and hostess, hand in
hand--after their usual fashion, as it seems--hurried forward to greet
their guests.  The meeting was touching in its simplicity.  The two
monarchs shook hands, and their consorts, representatives of the foremost
types of national beauty of the North and South, instinctively drew close
and kissed each other.  Then the hostess Queen, moving towards the
Western King, kneeled before him with the gracious obeisance of a Blue
Mountain hostess, and kissed his hand.

Her words of greeting were:

"You are welcome, sire, to the Blue Mountains.  We are grateful to you
for all you have done for Balka, and to you and Her Majesty for giving us
the honour of your presence."

The King seemed moved.  Accustomed as he was to the ritual of great
occasions, the warmth and sincerity, together with the gracious humility
of this old Eastern custom, touched him, monarch though he was of a great
land and many races in the Far East.  Impulsively he broke through Court
ritual, and did a thing which, I have since been told, won for him for
ever a holy place in the warm hearts of the Blue Mountaineers.  Sinking
on his knee before the beautiful shroud-clad Queen, he raised her hand
and kissed it.  The act was seen by all in and around the Blue Mouth, and
a mighty cheering rose, which seemed to rise and swell as it ran far and
wide up the hillsides, till it faded away on the far-off mountain-top,
where rose majestically the mighty Flagstaff bearing the standard of the
Balkan Federation.

For myself, I can never forget that wonderful scene of a nation's
enthusiasm, and the core of it is engraven on my memory.  That spotless
deck, typical of all that is perfect in naval use; the King and Queen of
the greatest nation of the earth {3} received by the newest King and
Queen--a King and Queen who won empire for themselves, so that the former
subject of another King received him as a brother-monarch on a
history-making occasion, when a new world-power was, under his tutelage,
springing into existence.  The fair Northern Queen in the arms of the
dark Southern Queen with the starry eyes.  The simple splendour of
Northern dress arrayed against that of almost peasant plainness of the
giant King of the South.  But all were eclipsed--even the thousand years
of royal lineage of the Western King, Rupert's natural dower of stature,
and the other Queen's bearing of royal dignity and sweetness--by the
elemental simplicity of Teuta's Shroud.  Not one of all that mighty
throng but knew something of her wonderful story; and not one but felt
glad and proud that such a noble woman had won an empire through her own
bravery, even in the jaws of the grave.

The armoured yacht, with the remainder of the signatories to the Balkan
Federation, drew close, and the rulers stepped on board to greet the
Western King, the Arbitrator, Rupert leaving his task as personal host
and joining them.  He took his part modestly in the rear of the group,
and made a fresh obeisance in his new capacity.

Presently another warship, _The Balka_, drew close.  It contained the
ambassadors of Foreign Powers, and the Chancellors and high officials of
the Balkan nations.  It was followed by a fleet of warships, each one
representing a Balkan Power.  The great Western fleet lay at their
moorings, but with the exception of manning their yards, took no
immediate part in the proceedings.

On the deck of the new-comer the Balkan monarchs took their places, the
officials of each State grading themselves behind their monarch.  The
Ambassadors formed a foremost group by themselves.

Last came the Western King, quite alone (save for the two Queens),
bearing in his hand the vellum scroll, the record of his arbitration.
This he proceeded to read, a polyglot copy of it having been already
supplied to every Monarch, Ambassador, and official present.  It was a
long statement, but the occasion was so stupendous--so intense--that the
time flew by quickly.  The cheering had ceased the moment the Arbitrator
opened the scroll, and a veritable silence of the grave abounded.

When the reading was concluded Rupert raised his hand, and on the instant
came a terrific salvo of cannon-shots from not only the ships in the
port, but seemingly all up and over the hillsides away to the very
summit.

When the cheering which followed the salute had somewhat toned down,
those on board talked together, and presentations were made.  Then the
barges took the whole company to the armour-clad fort in the entrance-way
to the Blue Mouth.  Here, in front, had been arranged for the occasion,
platforms for the starting of aeroplanes.  Behind them were the various
thrones of state for the Western King and Queen, and the various rulers
of "Balka"--as the new and completed Balkan Federation had become--_de
jure_ as well as _de facto_.  Behind were seats for the rest of the
company.  All was a blaze of crimson and gold.  We of the Press were all
expectant, for some ceremony had manifestly been arranged, but of all
details of it we had been kept in ignorance.  So far as I could tell from
the faces, those present were at best but partially informed.  They were
certainly ignorant of all details, and even of the entire programme of
the day.  There is a certain kind of expectation which is not concerned
in the mere execution of fore-ordered things.

The aero on which the King and Queen had come down from the mountain now
arrived on the platform in the charge of a tall young mountaineer, who
stepped from the steering-platform at once.  King Rupert, having handed
his Queen (who still carried her baby) into her seat, took his place, and
pulled a lever.  The aero went forward, and seemed to fall head foremost
off the fort.  It was but a dip, however, such as a skilful diver takes
from a height into shallow water, for the plane made an upward curve, and
in a few seconds was skimming upwards towards the Flagstaff.  Despite the
wind, it arrived there in an incredibly short time.  Immediately after
his flight another aero, a big one this time, glided to the platform.  To
this immediately stepped a body of ten tall, fine-looking young men.  The
driver pulled his levers, and the plane glided out on the track of the
King.  The Western King, who was noticing, said to the Lord High Admiral,
who had been himself in command of the ship of war, and now stood close
behind him:

"Who are those men, Admiral?"

"The Guard of the Crown Prince, Your Majesty.  They are appointed by the
Nation."

"Tell me, Admiral, have they any special duties?"

"Yes, Your Majesty," came the answer: "to die, if need be, for the young
Prince!"

"Quite right!  That is fine service.  But how if any of them should die?"

"Your Majesty, if one of them should die, there are ten thousand eager to
take his place."

"Fine, fine!  It is good to have even one man eager to give his life for
duty.  But ten thousand!  That is what makes a nation!"

When King Rupert reached the platform by the Flagstaff, the Royal
Standard of the Blue Mountains was hauled up under it.  Rupert stood up
and raised his hand.  In a second a cannon beside him was fired; then,
quick as thought, others were fired in sequence, as though by one
prolonged lightning-flash.  The roar was incessant, but getting less in
detonating sound as the distance and the hills subdued it.  But in the
general silence which prevailed round us we could hear the sound as
though passing in a distant circle, till finally the line which had gone
northward came back by the south, stopping at the last gun to south'ard
of the Flagstaff.

"What was that wonderful circle?" asked the King of the Lord High
Admiral.

"That, Your Majesty, is the line of the frontier of the Blue Mountains.
Rupert has ten thousand cannon in line."

"And who fires them?  I thought all the army must be here."

"The women, Your Majesty.  They are on frontier duty to-day, so that the
men can come here."

Just at that moment one of the Crown Prince's Guards brought to the side
of the King's aero something like a rubber ball on the end of a string.
The Queen held it out to the baby in her arms, who grabbed at it.  The
guard drew back.  Pressing that ball must have given some signal, for on
the instant a cannon, elevated to perpendicular, was fired.  A shell went
straight up an enormous distance.  The shell burst, and sent out both a
light so bright that it could be seen in the daylight, and a red smoke,
which might have been seen from the heights of the Calabrian Mountains
over in Italy.

As the shell burst, the King's aero seemed once more to spring from the
platform out into mid-air, dipped as before, and glided out over the Blue
Mouth with a rapidity which, to look at, took one's breath away.

As it came, followed by the aero of the Crown Prince's Guard and a group
of other aeros, the whole mountain-sides seemed to become alive.  From
everywhere, right away up to the farthest visible mountain-tops, darted
aeroplanes, till a host of them were rushing with dreadful speed in the
wake of the King.  The King turned to Queen Teuta, and evidently said
something, for she beckoned to the Captain of the Crown Prince's Guard,
who was steering the plane.  He swerved away to the right, and instead of
following above the open track between the lines of warships, went high
over the outer line.  One of those on board began to drop something,
which, fluttering down, landed on every occasion on the bridge of the
ship high over which they then were.

The Western King said again to the Gospodar Rooke (the Lord High
Admiral):

"It must need some skill to drop a letter with such accuracy."

With imperturbable face the Admiral replied:

"It is easier to drop bombs, Your Majesty."

The flight of aeroplanes was a memorable sight.  It helped to make
history.  Henceforth no nation with an eye for either defence or attack
can hope for success without the mastery of the air.

In the meantime--and after that time, too--God help the nation that
attacks "Balka" or any part of it, so long as Rupert and Teuta live in
the hearts of that people, and bind them into an irresistible unity.

CHAPTER I--ADAM SALTON ARRIVES


Adam Salton sauntered into the Empire Club, Sydney, and found awaiting
him a letter from his grand-uncle.  He had first heard from the old
gentleman less than a year before, when Richard Salton had claimed
kinship, stating that he had been unable to write earlier, as he had
found it very difficult to trace his grand-nephew's address.  Adam was
delighted and replied cordially; he had often heard his father speak of
the older branch of the family with whom his people had long lost touch.
Some interesting correspondence had ensued.  Adam eagerly opened the
letter which had only just arrived, and conveyed a cordial invitation to
stop with his grand-uncle at Lesser Hill, for as long a time as he could
spare.

"Indeed," Richard Salton went on, "I am in hopes that you will make your
permanent home here.  You see, my dear boy, you and I are all that remain
of our race, and it is but fitting that you should succeed me when the
time comes.  In this year of grace, 1860, I am close on eighty years of
age, and though we have been a long-lived race, the span of life cannot
be prolonged beyond reasonable bounds.  I am prepared to like you, and to
make your home with me as happy as you could wish.  So do come at once on
receipt of this, and find the welcome I am waiting to give you.  I send,
in case such may make matters easy for you, a banker's draft for 200
pounds.  Come soon, so that we may both of us enjoy many happy days
together.  If you are able to give me the pleasure of seeing you, send me
as soon as you can a letter telling me when to expect you.  Then when you
arrive at Plymouth or Southampton or whatever port you are bound for,
wait on board, and I will meet you at the earliest hour possible."

* * * * *

Old Mr. Salton was delighted when Adam's reply arrived and sent a groom
hot-foot to his crony, Sir Nathaniel de Salis, to inform him that his
grand-nephew was due at Southampton on the twelfth of June.

Mr. Salton gave instructions to have ready a carriage early on the
important day, to start for Stafford, where he would catch the 11.40 a.m.
train.  He would stay that night with his grand-nephew, either on the
ship, which would be a new experience for him, or, if his guest should
prefer it, at a hotel.  In either case they would start in the early
morning for home.  He had given instructions to his bailiff to send the
postillion carriage on to Southampton, to be ready for their journey
home, and to arrange for relays of his own horses to be sent on at once.
He intended that his grand-nephew, who had been all his life in
Australia, should see something of rural England on the drive.  He had
plenty of young horses of his own breeding and breaking, and could depend
on a journey memorable to the young man.  The luggage would be sent on by
rail to Stafford, where one of his carts would meet it.  Mr. Salton,
during the journey to Southampton, often wondered if his grand-nephew was
as much excited as he was at the idea of meeting so near a relation for
the first time; and it was with an effort that he controlled himself.  The
endless railway lines and switches round the Southampton Docks fired his
anxiety afresh.

As the train drew up on the dockside, he was getting his hand traps
together, when the carriage door was wrenched open and a young man jumped
in.

"How are you, uncle?  I recognised you from the photo you sent me!  I
wanted to meet you as soon as I could, but everything is so strange to me
that I didn't quite know what to do.  However, here I am.  I am glad to
see you, sir.  I have been dreaming of this happiness for thousands of
miles; now I find that the reality beats all the dreaming!"  As he spoke
the old man and the young one were heartily wringing each other's hands.

The meeting so auspiciously begun proceeded well.  Adam, seeing that the
old man was interested in the novelty of the ship, suggested that he
should stay the night on board, and that he would himself be ready to
start at any hour and go anywhere that the other suggested.  This
affectionate willingness to fall in with his own plans quite won the old
man's heart.  He warmly accepted the invitation, and at once they became
not only on terms of affectionate relationship, but almost like old
friends.  The heart of the old man, which had been empty for so long,
found a new delight.  The young man found, on landing in the old country,
a welcome and a surrounding in full harmony with all his dreams
throughout his wanderings and solitude, and the promise of a fresh and
adventurous life.  It was not long before the old man accepted him to
full relationship by calling him by his Christian name.  After a long
talk on affairs of interest, they retired to the cabin, which the elder
was to share.  Richard Salton put his hands affectionately on the boy's
shoulders--though Adam was in his twenty-seventh year, he was a boy, and
always would be, to his grand-uncle.

"I am so glad to find you as you are, my dear boy--just such a young man
as I had always hoped for as a son, in the days when I still had such
hopes.  However, that is all past.  But thank God there is a new life to
begin for both of us.  To you must be the larger part--but there is still
time for some of it to be shared in common.  I have waited till we should
have seen each other to enter upon the subject; for I thought it better
not to tie up your young life to my old one till we should have
sufficient personal knowledge to justify such a venture.  Now I can, so
far as I am concerned, enter into it freely, since from the moment my
eyes rested on you I saw my son--as he shall be, God willing--if he
chooses such a course himself."

"Indeed I do, sir--with all my heart!"

"Thank you, Adam, for that."  The old, man's eyes filled and his voice
trembled.  Then, after a long silence between them, he went on: "When I
heard you were coming I made my will.  It was well that your interests
should be protected from that moment on.  Here is the deed--keep it,
Adam.  All I have shall belong to you; and if love and good wishes, or
the memory of them, can make life sweeter, yours shall be a happy one.
Now, my dear boy, let us turn in.  We start early in the morning and have
a long drive before us.  I hope you don't mind driving?  I was going to
have the old travelling carriage in which my grandfather, your
great-grand-uncle, went to Court when William IV. was king.  It is all
right--they built well in those days--and it has been kept in perfect
order.  But I think I have done better: I have sent the carriage in which
I travel myself.  The horses are of my own breeding, and relays of them
shall take us all the way.  I hope you like horses?  They have long been
one of my greatest interests in life."

"I love them, sir, and I am happy to say I have many of my own.  My
father gave me a horse farm for myself when I was eighteen.  I devoted
myself to it, and it has gone on.  Before I came away, my steward gave me
a memorandum that we have in my own place more than a thousand, nearly
all good."

"I am glad, my boy.  Another link between us."

"Just fancy what a delight it will be, sir, to see so much of England--and
with you!"

"Thank you again, my boy.  I will tell you all about your future home and
its surroundings as we go.  We shall travel in old-fashioned state, I
tell you.  My grandfather always drove four-in-hand; and so shall we."

"Oh, thanks, sir, thanks.  May I take the ribbons sometimes?"

"Whenever you choose, Adam.  The team is your own.  Every horse we use to-
day is to be your own."

"You are too generous, uncle!"

"Not at all.  Only an old man's selfish pleasure.  It is not every day
that an heir to the old home comes back.  And--oh, by the way . . . No,
we had better turn in now--I shall tell you the rest in the morning."




CHAPTER II--THE CASWALLS OF CASTRA REGIS


Mr. Salton had all his life been an early riser, and necessarily an early
waker.  But early as he woke on the next morning--and although there was
an excuse for not prolonging sleep in the constant whirr and rattle of
the "donkey" engine winches of the great ship--he met the eyes of Adam
fixed on him from his berth.  His grand-nephew had given him the sofa,
occupying the lower berth himself.  The old man, despite his great
strength and normal activity, was somewhat tired by his long journey of
the day before, and the prolonged and exciting interview which followed
it.  So he was glad to lie still and rest his body, whilst his mind was
actively exercised in taking in all he could of his strange surroundings.
Adam, too, after the pastoral habit to which he had been bred, woke with
the dawn, and was ready to enter on the experiences of the new day
whenever it might suit his elder companion.  It was little wonder, then,
that, so soon as each realised the other's readiness, they simultaneously
jumped up and began to dress.  The steward had by previous instructions
early breakfast prepared, and it was not long before they went down the
gangway on shore in search of the carriage.

They found Mr. Salton's bailiff looking out for them on the dock, and he
brought them at once to where the carriage was waiting in the street.
Richard Salton pointed out with pride to his young companion the
suitability of the vehicle for every need of travel.  To it were
harnessed four useful horses, with a postillion to each pair.

"See," said the old man proudly, "how it has all the luxuries of useful
travel--silence and isolation as well as speed.  There is nothing to
obstruct the view of those travelling and no one to overhear what they
may say.  I have used that trap for a quarter of a century, and I never
saw one more suitable for travel.  You shall test it shortly.  We are
going to drive through the heart of England; and as we go I'll tell you
what I was speaking of last night.  Our route is to be by Salisbury,
Bath, Bristol, Cheltenham, Worcester, Stafford; and so home."

Adam remained silent a few minutes, during which he seemed all eyes, for
he perpetually ranged the whole circle of the horizon.

"Has our journey to-day, sir," he asked, "any special relation to what
you said last night that you wanted to tell me?"

"Not directly; but indirectly, everything."

"Won't you tell me now--I see we cannot be overheard--and if anything
strikes you as we go along, just run it in.  I shall understand."

So old Salton spoke:

"To begin at the beginning, Adam.  That lecture of yours on 'The Romans
in Britain,' a report of which you posted to me, set me thinking--in
addition to telling me your tastes.  I wrote to you at once and asked you
to come home, for it struck me that if you were fond of historical
research--as seemed a fact--this was exactly the place for you, in
addition to its being the home of your own forbears.  If you could learn
so much of the British Romans so far away in New South Wales, where there
cannot be even a tradition of them, what might you not make of the same
amount of study on the very spot.  Where we are going is in the real
heart of the old kingdom of Mercia, where there are traces of all the
various nationalities which made up the conglomerate which became
Britain."

"I rather gathered that you had some more definite--more personal reason
for my hurrying.  After all, history can keep--except in the making!"

"Quite right, my boy.  I had a reason such as you very wisely guessed.  I
was anxious for you to be here when a rather important phase of our local
history occurred."

"What is that, if I may ask, sir?"

"Certainly.  The principal landowner of our part of the county is on his
way home, and there will be a great home-coming, which you may care to
see.  The fact is, for more than a century the various owners in the
succession here, with the exception of a short time, have lived abroad."

"How is that, sir, if I may ask?"

"The great house and estate in our part of the world is Castra Regis, the
family seat of the Caswall family.  The last owner who lived here was
Edgar Caswall, grandfather of the man who is coming here--and he was the
only one who stayed even a short time.  This man's grandfather, also
named Edgar--they keep the tradition of the family Christian
name--quarrelled with his family and went to live abroad, not keeping up
any intercourse, good or bad, with his relatives, although this
particular Edgar, as I told you, did visit his family estate, yet his son
was born and lived and died abroad, while his grandson, the latest
inheritor, was also born and lived abroad till he was over thirty--his
present age.  This was the second line of absentees.  The great estate of
Castra Regis has had no knowledge of its owner for five
generations--covering more than a hundred and twenty years.  It has been
well administered, however, and no tenant or other connected with it has
had anything of which to complain.  All the same, there has been much
natural anxiety to see the new owner, and we are all excited about the
event of his coming.  Even I am, though I own my own estate, which,
though adjacent, is quite apart from Castra Regis.--Here we are now in
new ground for you.  That is the spire of Salisbury Cathedral, and when
we leave that we shall be getting close to the old Roman county, and you
will naturally want your eyes.  So we shall shortly have to keep our
minds on old Mercia.  However, you need not be disappointed.  My old
friend, Sir Nathaniel de Salis, who, like myself, is a free-holder near
Castra Regis--his estate, Doom Tower, is over the border of Derbyshire,
on the Peak--is coming to stay with me for the festivities to welcome
Edgar Caswall.  He is just the sort of man you will like.  He is devoted
to history, and is President of the Mercian Archaeological Society.  He
knows more of our own part of the country, with its history and its
people, than anyone else.  I expect he will have arrived before us, and
we three can have a long chat after dinner.  He is also our local
geologist and natural historian.  So you and he will have many interests
in common.  Amongst other things he has a special knowledge of the Peak
and its caverns, and knows all the old legends of prehistoric times."

They spent the night at Cheltenham, and on the following morning resumed
their journey to Stafford.  Adam's eyes were in constant employment, and
it was not till Salton declared that they had now entered on the last
stage of their journey, that he referred to Sir Nathaniel's coming.

As the dusk was closing down, they drove on to Lesser Hill, Mr. Salton's
house.  It was now too dark to see any details of their surroundings.
Adam could just see that it was on the top of a hill, not quite so high
as that which was covered by the Castle, on whose tower flew the flag,
and which was all ablaze with moving lights, manifestly used in the
preparations for the festivities on the morrow.  So Adam deferred his
curiosity till daylight.  His grand-uncle was met at the door by a fine
old man, who greeted him warmly.

"I came over early as you wished.  I suppose this is your grand-nephew--I
am glad to meet you, Mr. Adam Salton.  I am Nathaniel de Salis, and your
uncle is one of my oldest friends."

Adam, from the moment of their eyes meeting, felt as if they were already
friends.  The meeting was a new note of welcome to those that had already
sounded in his ears.

The cordiality with which Sir Nathaniel and Adam met, made the imparting
of information easy.  Sir Nathaniel was a clever man of the world, who
had travelled much, and within a certain area studied deeply.  He was a
brilliant conversationalist, as was to be expected from a successful
diplomatist, even under unstimulating conditions.  But he had been
touched and to a certain extent fired by the younger man's evident
admiration and willingness to learn from him.  Accordingly the
conversation, which began on the most friendly basis, soon warmed to an
interest above proof, as the old man spoke of it next day to Richard
Salton.  He knew already that his old friend wanted his grand-nephew to
learn all he could of the subject in hand, and so had during his journey
from the Peak put his thoughts in sequence for narration and explanation.
Accordingly, Adam had only to listen and he must learn much that he
wanted to know.  When dinner was over and the servants had withdrawn,
leaving the three men at their wine, Sir Nathaniel began.

"I gather from your uncle--by the way, I suppose we had better speak of
you as uncle and nephew, instead of going into exact relationship?  In
fact, your uncle is so old and dear a friend, that, with your permission,
I shall drop formality with you altogether and speak of you and to you as
Adam, as though you were his son."

"I should like," answered the young man, "nothing better!"

The answer warmed the hearts of both the old men, but, with the usual
avoidance of Englishmen of emotional subjects personal to themselves,
they instinctively returned to the previous question.  Sir Nathaniel took
the lead.

"I understand, Adam, that your uncle has posted you regarding the
relationships of the Caswall family?"

"Partly, sir; but I understood that I was to hear minuter details from
you--if you would be so good."

"I shall be delighted to tell you anything so far as my knowledge goes.
Well, the first Caswall in our immediate record is an Edgar, head of the
family and owner of the estate, who came into his kingdom just about the
time that George III. did.  He had one son of about twenty-four.  There
was a violent quarrel between the two.  No one of this generation has any
idea of the cause; but, considering the family characteristics, we may
take it for granted that though it was deep and violent, it was on the
surface trivial.

"The result of the quarrel was that the son left the house without a
reconciliation or without even telling his father where he was going.  He
never came back again.  A few years after, he died, without having in the
meantime exchanged a word or a letter with his father.  He married abroad
and left one son, who seems to have been brought up in ignorance of all
belonging to him.  The gulf between them appears to have been
unbridgable; for in time this son married and in turn had a son, but
neither joy nor sorrow brought the sundered together.  Under such
conditions no _rapprochement_ was to be looked for, and an utter
indifference, founded at best on ignorance, took the place of family
affection--even on community of interests.  It was only due to the
watchfulness of the lawyers that the birth of this new heir was ever made
known.  He actually spent a few months in the ancestral home.

"After this the family interest merely rested on heirship of the estate.
As no other children have been born to any of the newer generations in
the intervening years, all hopes of heritage are now centred in the
grandson of this man.

"Now, it will be well for you to bear in mind the prevailing
characteristics of this race.  These were well preserved and unchanging;
one and all they are the same: cold, selfish, dominant, reckless of
consequences in pursuit of their own will.  It was not that they did not
keep faith, though that was a matter which gave them little concern, but
that they took care to think beforehand of what they should do in order
to gain their own ends.  If they should make a mistake, someone else
should bear the burthen of it.  This was so perpetually recurrent that it
seemed to be a part of a fixed policy.  It was no wonder that, whatever
changes took place, they were always ensured in their own possessions.
They were absolutely cold and hard by nature.  Not one of them--so far as
we have any knowledge--was ever known to be touched by the softer
sentiments, to swerve from his purpose, or hold his hand in obedience to
the dictates of his heart.  The pictures and effigies of them all show
their adherence to the early Roman type.  Their eyes were full; their
hair, of raven blackness, grew thick and close and curly.  Their figures
were massive and typical of strength.

"The thick black hair, growing low down on the neck, told of vast
physical strength and endurance.  But the most remarkable characteristic
is the eyes.  Black, piercing, almost unendurable, they seem to contain
in themselves a remarkable will power which there is no gainsaying.  It
is a power that is partly racial and partly individual: a power
impregnated with some mysterious quality, partly hypnotic, partly
mesmeric, which seems to take away from eyes that meet them all power of
resistance--nay, all power of wishing to resist.  With eyes like those,
set in that all-commanding face, one would need to be strong indeed to
think of resisting the inflexible will that lay behind.

"You may think, Adam, that all this is imagination on my part, especially
as I have never seen any of them.  So it is, but imagination based on
deep study.  I have made use of all I know or can surmise logically
regarding this strange race.  With such strange compelling qualities, is
it any wonder that there is abroad an idea that in the race there is some
demoniac possession, which tends to a more definite belief that certain
individuals have in the past sold themselves to the Devil?

"But I think we had better go to bed now.  We have a lot to get through
to-morrow, and I want you to have your brain clear, and all your
susceptibilities fresh.  Moreover, I want you to come with me for an
early walk, during which we may notice, whilst the matter is fresh in our
minds, the peculiar disposition of this place--not merely your
grand-uncle's estate, but the lie of the country around it.  There are
many things on which we may seek--and perhaps find--enlightenment.  The
more we know at the start, the more things which may come into our view
will develop themselves."




CHAPTER III--DIANA'S GROVE


Curiosity took Adam Salton out of bed in the early morning, but when he
had dressed and gone downstairs; he found that, early as he was, Sir
Nathaniel was ahead of him.  The old gentleman was quite prepared for a
long walk, and they started at once.

Sir Nathaniel, without speaking, led the way to the east, down the hill.
When they had descended and risen again, they found themselves on the
eastern brink of a steep hill.  It was of lesser height than that on
which the Castle was situated; but it was so placed that it commanded the
various hills that crowned the ridge.  All along the ridge the rock
cropped out, bare and bleak, but broken in rough natural castellation.
The form of the ridge was a segment of a circle, with the higher points
inland to the west.  In the centre rose the Castle, on the highest point
of all.  Between the various rocky excrescences were groups of trees of
various sizes and heights, amongst some of which were what, in the early
morning light, looked like ruins.  These--whatever they were--were of
massive grey stone, probably limestone rudely cut--if indeed they were
not shaped naturally.  The fall of the ground was steep all along the
ridge, so steep that here and there both trees and rocks and buildings
seemed to overhang the plain far below, through which ran many streams.

Sir Nathaniel stopped and looked around, as though to lose nothing of the
effect.  The sun had climbed the eastern sky and was making all details
clear.  He pointed with a sweeping gesture, as though calling Adam's
attention to the extent of the view.  Having done so, he covered the
ground more slowly, as though inviting attention to detail.  Adam was a
willing and attentive pupil, and followed his motions exactly, missing--or
trying to miss--nothing.

"I have brought you here, Adam, because it seems to me that this is the
spot on which to begin our investigations.  You have now in front of you
almost the whole of the ancient kingdom of Mercia.  In fact, we see the
whole of it except that furthest part, which is covered by the Welsh
Marches and those parts which are hidden from where we stand by the high
ground of the immediate west.  We can see--theoretically--the whole of
the eastern bound of the kingdom, which ran south from the Humber to the
Wash.  I want you to bear in mind the trend of the ground, for some time,
sooner or later, we shall do well to have it in our mind's eye when we
are considering the ancient traditions and superstitions, and are trying
to find the _rationale_ of them.  Each legend, each superstition which we
receive, will help in the understanding and possible elucidation of the
others.  And as all such have a local basis, we can come closer to the
truth--or the probability--by knowing the local conditions as we go
along.  It will help us to bring to our aid such geological truth as we
may have between us.  For instance, the building materials used in
various ages can afford their own lessons to understanding eyes.  The
very heights and shapes and materials of these hills--nay, even of the
wide plain that lies between us and the sea--have in themselves the
materials of enlightening books."

"For instance, sir?" said Adam, venturing a question.

"Well, look at those hills which surround the main one where the site for
the Castle was wisely chosen--on the highest ground.  Take the others.
There is something ostensible in each of them, and in all probability
something unseen and unproved, but to be imagined, also."

"For instance?" continued Adam.

"Let us take them _seriatim_.  That to the east, where the trees are,
lower down--that was once the location of a Roman temple, possibly
founded on a pre-existing Druidical one.  Its name implies the former,
and the grove of ancient oaks suggests the latter."

"Please explain."

"The old name translated means 'Diana's Grove.'  Then the next one higher
than it, but just beyond it, is called '_Mercy_'--in all probability a
corruption or familiarisation of the word _Mercia_, with a Roman pun
included.  We learn from early manuscripts that the place was called
_Vilula Misericordiae_.  It was originally a nunnery, founded by Queen
Bertha, but done away with by King Penda, the reactionary to Paganism
after St. Augustine.  Then comes your uncle's place--Lesser Hill.  Though
it is so close to the Castle, it is not connected with it.  It is a
freehold, and, so far as we know, of equal age.  It has always belonged
to your family."

"Then there only remains the Castle!"

"That is all; but its history contains the histories of all the others--in
fact, the whole history of early England."  Sir Nathaniel, seeing the
expectant look on Adam's face, went on:

"The history of the Castle has no beginning so far as we know.  The
furthest records or surmises or inferences simply accept it as existing.
Some of these--guesses, let us call them--seem to show that there was
some sort of structure there when the Romans came, therefore it must have
been a place of importance in Druid times--if indeed that was the
beginning.  Naturally the Romans accepted it, as they did everything of
the kind that was, or might be, useful.  The change is shown or inferred
in the name Castra.  It was the highest protected ground, and so
naturally became the most important of their camps.  A study of the map
will show you that it must have been a most important centre.  It both
protected the advances already made to the north, and helped to dominate
the sea coast.  It sheltered the western marches, beyond which lay savage
Wales--and danger.  It provided a means of getting to the Severn, round
which lay the great Roman roads then coming into existence, and made
possible the great waterway to the heart of England--through the Severn
and its tributaries.  It brought the east and the west together by the
swiftest and easiest ways known to those times.  And, finally, it
provided means of descent on London and all the expanse of country
watered by the Thames.

"With such a centre, already known and organised, we can easily see that
each fresh wave of invasion--the Angles, the Saxons, the Danes, and the
Normans--found it a desirable possession and so ensured its upholding.  In
the earlier centuries it was merely a vantage ground.  But when the
victorious Romans brought with them the heavy solid fortifications
impregnable to the weapons of the time, its commanding position alone
ensured its adequate building and equipment.  Then it was that the
fortified camp of the Caesars developed into the castle of the king.  As
we are as yet ignorant of the names of the first kings of Mercia, no
historian has been able to guess which of them made it his ultimate
defence; and I suppose we shall never know now.  In process of time, as
the arts of war developed, it increased in size and strength, and
although recorded details are lacking, the history is written not merely
in the stone of its building, but is inferred in the changes of
structure.  Then the sweeping changes which followed the Norman Conquest
wiped out all lesser records than its own.  To-day we must accept it as
one of the earliest castles of the Conquest, probably not later than the
time of Henry I.  Roman and Norman were both wise in their retention of
places of approved strength or utility.  So it was that these surrounding
heights, already established and to a certain extent proved, were
retained.  Indeed, such characteristics as already pertained to them were
preserved, and to-day afford to us lessons regarding things which have
themselves long since passed away.

"So much for the fortified heights; but the hollows too have their own
story.  But how the time passes!  We must hurry home, or your uncle will
wonder what has become of us."

He started with long steps towards Lesser Hill, and Adam was soon
furtively running in order to keep up with him.




CHAPTER IV--THE LADY ARABELLA MARCH


"Now, there is no hurry, but so soon as you are both ready we shall
start," Mr. Salton said when breakfast had begun.  "I want to take you
first to see a remarkable relic of Mercia, and then we'll go to Liverpool
through what is called 'The Great Vale of Cheshire.'  You may be
disappointed, but take care not to prepare your mind"--this to Adam--"for
anything stupendous or heroic.  You would not think the place a vale at
all, unless you were told so beforehand, and had confidence in the
veracity of the teller.  We should get to the Landing Stage in time to
meet the _West African_, and catch Mr. Caswall as he comes ashore.  We
want to do him honour--and, besides, it will be more pleasant to have the
introductions over before we go to his _fete_ at the Castle."

The carriage was ready, the same as had been used the previous day, but
there were different horses--magnificent animals, and keen for work.
Breakfast was soon over, and they shortly took their places.  The
postillions had their orders, and were quickly on their way at an
exhilarating pace.

Presently, in obedience to Mr. Salton's signal, the carriage drew up
opposite a great heap of stones by the wayside.

"Here, Adam," he said, "is something that you of all men should not pass
by unnoticed.  That heap of stones brings us at once to the dawn of the
Anglian kingdom.  It was begun more than a thousand years ago--in the
latter part of the seventh century--in memory of a murder.  Wulfere, King
of Mercia, nephew of Penda, here murdered his two sons for embracing
Christianity.  As was the custom of the time, each passer-by added a
stone to the memorial heap.  Penda represented heathen reaction after St.
Augustine's mission.  Sir Nathaniel can tell you as much as you want
about this, and put you, if you wish, on the track of such accurate
knowledge as there is."

Whilst they were looking at the heap of stones, they noticed that another
carriage had drawn up beside them, and the passenger--there was only
one--was regarding them curiously.  The carriage was an old heavy
travelling one, with arms blazoned on it gorgeously.  The men took off
their hats, as the occupant, a lady, addressed them.

"How do you do, Sir Nathaniel?  How do you do, Mr. Salton?  I hope you
have not met with any accident.  Look at me!"

As she spoke she pointed to where one of the heavy springs was broken
across, the broken metal showing bright.  Adam spoke up at once:

"Oh, that can soon be put right."

"Soon?  There is no one near who can mend a break like that."

"I can."

"You!"  She looked incredulously at the dapper young gentleman who spoke.
"You--why, it's a workman's job."

"All right, I am a workman--though that is not the only sort of work I
do.  I am an Australian, and, as we have to move about fast, we are all
trained to farriery and such mechanics as come into travel--I am quite at
your service."

"I hardly know how to thank you for your kindness, of which I gladly
avail myself.  I don't know what else I can do, as I wish to meet Mr.
Caswall of Castra Regis, who arrives home from Africa to-day.  It is a
notable home-coming; all the countryside want to do him honour."  She
looked at the old men and quickly made up her mind as to the identity of
the stranger.  "You must be Mr. Adam Salton of Lesser Hill.  I am Lady
Arabella March of Diana's Grove."  As she spoke she turned slightly to
Mr. Salton, who took the hint and made a formal introduction.

So soon as this was done, Adam took some tools from his uncle's carriage,
and at once began work on the broken spring.  He was an expert workman,
and the breach was soon made good.  Adam was gathering the tools which he
had been using--which, after the manner of all workmen, had been
scattered about--when he noticed that several black snakes had crawled
out from the heap of stones and were gathering round him.  This naturally
occupied his mind, and he was not thinking of anything else when he
noticed Lady Arabella, who had opened the door of the carriage, slip from
it with a quick gliding motion.  She was already among the snakes when he
called out to warn her.  But there seemed to be no need of warning.  The
snakes had turned and were wriggling back to the mound as quickly as they
could.  He laughed to himself behind his teeth as he whispered, "No need
to fear there.  They seem much more afraid of her than she of them."  All
the same he began to beat on the ground with a stick which was lying
close to him, with the instinct of one used to such vermin.  In an
instant he was alone beside the mound with Lady Arabella, who appeared
quite unconcerned at the incident.  Then he took a long look at her, and
her dress alone was sufficient to attract attention.  She was clad in
some kind of soft white stuff, which clung close to her form, showing to
the full every movement of her sinuous figure.  She wore a close-fitting
cap of some fine fur of dazzling white.  Coiled round her white throat
was a large necklace of emeralds, whose profusion of colour dazzled when
the sun shone on them.  Her voice was peculiar, very low and sweet, and
so soft that the dominant note was of sibilation.  Her hands, too, were
peculiar--long, flexible, white, with a strange movement as of waving
gently to and fro.

She appeared quite at ease, and, after thanking Adam, said that if any of
his uncle's party were going to Liverpool she would be most happy to join
forces.

"Whilst you are staying here, Mr. Salton, you must look on the grounds of
Diana's Grove as your own, so that you may come and go just as you do in
Lesser Hill.  There are some fine views, and not a few natural
curiosities which are sure to interest you, if you are a student of
natural history--specially of an earlier kind, when the world was
younger."

The heartiness with which she spoke, and the warmth of her words--not of
her manner, which was cold and distant--made him suspicious.  In the
meantime both his uncle and Sir Nathaniel had thanked her for the
invitation--of which, however, they said they were unable to avail
themselves.  Adam had a suspicion that, though she answered regretfully,
she was in reality relieved.  When he had got into the carriage with the
two old men, and they had driven off, he was not surprised when Sir
Nathaniel spoke.

"I could not but feel that she was glad to be rid of us.  She can play
her game better alone!"

"What is her game?" asked Adam unthinkingly.

"All the county knows it, my boy.  Caswall is a very rich man.  Her
husband was rich when she married him--or seemed to be.  When he
committed suicide, it was found that he had nothing left, and the estate
was mortgaged up to the hilt.  Her only hope is in a rich marriage.  I
suppose I need not draw any conclusion; you can do that as well as I
can."

Adam remained silent nearly all the time they were travelling through the
alleged Vale of Cheshire.  He thought much during that journey and came
to several conclusions, though his lips were unmoved.  One of these
conclusions was that he would be very careful about paying any attention
to Lady Arabella.  He was himself a rich man, how rich not even his uncle
had the least idea, and would have been surprised had he known.

The remainder of the journey was uneventful, and upon arrival at
Liverpool they went aboard the _West African_, which had just come to the
landing-stage.  There his uncle introduced himself to Mr. Caswall, and
followed this up by introducing Sir Nathaniel and then Adam.  The new-
comer received them graciously, and said what a pleasure it was to be
coming home after so long an absence of his family from their old seat.
Adam was pleased at the warmth of the reception; but he could not avoid a
feeling of repugnance at the man's face.  He was trying hard to overcome
this when a diversion was caused by the arrival of Lady Arabella.  The
diversion was welcome to all; the two Saltons and Sir Nathaniel were
shocked at Caswall's face--so hard, so ruthless, so selfish, so dominant.
"God help any," was the common thought, "who is under the domination of
such a man!"

Presently his African servant approached him, and at once their thoughts
changed to a larger toleration.  Caswall looked indeed a savage--but a
cultured savage.  In him were traces of the softening civilisation of
ages--of some of the higher instincts and education of man, no matter how
rudimentary these might be.  But the face of Oolanga, as his master
called him, was unreformed, unsoftened savage, and inherent in it were
all the hideous possibilities of a lost, devil-ridden child of the forest
and the swamp--the lowest of all created things that could be regarded as
in some form ostensibly human.  Lady Arabella and Oolanga arrived almost
simultaneously, and Adam was surprised to notice what effect their
appearance had on each other.  The woman seemed as if she would not--could
not--condescend to exhibit any concern or interest in such a creature.  On
the other hand, the negro's bearing was such as in itself to justify her
pride.  He treated her not merely as a slave treats his master, but as a
worshipper would treat a deity.  He knelt before her with his hands out-
stretched and his forehead in the dust.  So long as she remained he did
not move; it was only when she went over to Caswall that he relaxed his
attitude of devotion and stood by respectfully.

Adam spoke to his own man, Davenport, who was standing by, having arrived
with the bailiff of Lesser Hill, who had followed Mr. Salton in a pony
trap.  As he spoke, he pointed to an attentive ship's steward, and
presently the two men were conversing.

"I think we ought to be moving," Mr. Salton said to Adam.  "I have some
things to do in Liverpool, and I am sure that both Mr. Caswall and Lady
Arabella would like to get under weigh for Castra Regis."

"I too, sir, would like to do something," replied Adam.  "I want to find
out where Ross, the animal merchant, lives--I want to take a small animal
home with me, if you don't mind.  He is only a little thing, and will be
no trouble."

"Of course not, my boy.  What kind of animal is it that you want?"

"A mongoose."

"A mongoose!  What on earth do you want it for?"

"To kill snakes."

"Good!"  The old man remembered the mound of stones.  No explanation was
needed.

When Ross heard what was wanted, he asked:

"Do you want something special, or will an ordinary mongoose do?"

"Well, of course I want a good one.  But I see no need for anything
special.  It is for ordinary use."

"I can let you have a choice of ordinary ones.  I only asked, because I
have in stock a very special one which I got lately from Nepaul.  He has
a record of his own.  He killed a king cobra that had been seen in the
Rajah's garden.  But I don't suppose we have any snakes of the kind in
this cold climate--I daresay an ordinary one will do."

When Adam got back to the carriage, carefully carrying the box with the
mongoose, Sir Nathaniel said: "Hullo! what have you got there?"

"A mongoose."

"What for?"

"To kill snakes!"

Sir Nathaniel laughed.

"I heard Lady Arabella's invitation to you to come to Diana's Grove."

"Well, what on earth has that got to do with it?"

"Nothing directly that I know of.  But we shall see."  Adam waited, and
the old man went on: "Have you by any chance heard the other name which
was given long ago to that place."

"No, sir."

"It was called--Look here, this subject wants a lot of talking over.
Suppose we wait till we are alone and have lots of time before us."

"All right, sir."  Adam was filled with curiosity, but he thought it
better not to hurry matters.  All would come in good time.  Then the
three men returned home, leaving Mr. Caswall to spend the night in
Liverpool.

The following day the Lesser Hill party set out for Castra Regis, and for
the time Adam thought no more of Diana's Grove or of what mysteries it
had contained--or might still contain.

The guests were crowding in, and special places were marked for important
people.  Adam, seeing so many persons of varied degree, looked round for
Lady Arabella, but could not locate her.  It was only when he saw the old-
fashioned travelling carriage approach and heard the sound of cheering
which went with it, that he realised that Edgar Caswall had arrived.
Then, on looking more closely, he saw that Lady Arabella, dressed as he
had seen her last, was seated beside him.  When the carriage drew up at
the great flight of steps, the host jumped down and gave her his hand.

It was evident to all that she was the chief guest at the festivities.  It
was not long before the seats on the dais were filled, while the tenants
and guests of lesser importance had occupied all the coigns of vantage
not reserved.  The order of the day had been carefully arranged by a
committee.  There were some speeches, happily neither many nor long; and
then festivities were suspended till the time for feasting arrived.  In
the interval Caswall walked among his guests, speaking to all in a
friendly manner and expressing a general welcome.  The other guests came
down from the dais and followed his example, so there was unceremonious
meeting and greeting between gentle and simple.

Adam Salton naturally followed with his eyes all that went on within
their scope, taking note of all who seemed to afford any interest.  He
was young and a man and a stranger from a far distance; so on all these
accounts he naturally took stock rather of the women than of the men, and
of these, those who were young and attractive.  There were lots of pretty
girls among the crowd, and Adam, who was a handsome young man and well
set up, got his full share of admiring glances.  These did not concern
him much, and he remained unmoved until there came along a group of
three, by their dress and bearing, of the farmer class.  One was a sturdy
old man; the other two were good-looking girls, one of a little over
twenty, the other not quite so old.  So soon as Adam's eyes met those of
the younger girl, who stood nearest to him, some sort of electricity
flashed--that divine spark which begins by recognition, and ends in
obedience.  Men call it "Love."

Both his companions noticed how much Adam was taken by the pretty girl,
and spoke of her to him in a way which made his heart warm to them.

"Did you notice that party that passed?  The old man is Michael Watford,
one of the tenants of Mr. Caswall.  He occupies Mercy Farm, which Sir
Nathaniel pointed out to you to-day.  The girls are his grand-daughters,
the elder, Lilla, being the only child of his elder son, who died when
she was less than a year old.  His wife died on the same day.  She is a
good girl--as good as she is pretty.  The other is her first cousin, the
daughter of Watford's second son.  He went for a soldier when he was just
over twenty, and was drafted abroad.  He was not a good correspondent,
though he was a good enough son.  A few letters came, and then his father
heard from the colonel of his regiment that he had been killed by dacoits
in Burmah.  He heard from the same source that his boy had been married
to a Burmese, and that there was a daughter only a year old.  Watford had
the child brought home, and she grew up beside Lilla.  The only thing
that they heard of her birth was that her name was Mimi.  The two
children adored each other, and do to this day.  Strange how different
they are!  Lilla all fair, like the old Saxon stock from which she is
sprung; Mimi showing a trace of her mother's race.  Lilla is as gentle as
a dove, but Mimi's black eyes can glow whenever she is upset.  The only
thing that upsets her is when anything happens to injure or threaten or
annoy Lilla.  Then her eyes glow as do the eyes of a bird when her young
are menaced."




CHAPTER V--THE WHITE WORM


Mr. Salton introduced Adam to Mr. Watford and his grand-daughters, and
they all moved on together.  Of course neighbours in the position of the
Watfords knew all about Adam Salton, his relationship, circumstances, and
prospects.  So it would have been strange indeed if both girls did not
dream of possibilities of the future.  In agricultural England, eligible
men of any class are rare.  This particular man was specially eligible,
for he did not belong to a class in which barriers of caste were strong.
So when it began to be noticed that he walked beside Mimi Watford and
seemed to desire her society, all their friends endeavoured to give the
promising affair a helping hand.  When the gongs sounded for the banquet,
he went with her into the tent where her grandfather had seats.  Mr.
Salton and Sir Nathaniel noticed that the young man did not come to claim
his appointed place at the dais table; but they understood and made no
remark, or indeed did not seem to notice his absence.

Lady Arabella sat as before at Edgar Caswall's right hand.  She was
certainly a striking and unusual woman, and to all it seemed fitting from
her rank and personal qualities that she should be the chosen partner of
the heir on his first appearance.  Of course nothing was said openly by
those of her own class who were present; but words were not necessary
when so much could be expressed by nods and smiles.  It seemed to be an
accepted thing that at last there was to be a mistress of Castra Regis,
and that she was present amongst them.  There were not lacking some who,
whilst admitting all her charm and beauty, placed her in the second rank,
Lilla Watford being marked as first.  There was sufficient divergence of
type, as well as of individual beauty, to allow of fair comment; Lady
Arabella represented the aristocratic type, and Lilla that of the
commonalty.

When the dusk began to thicken, Mr. Salton and Sir Nathaniel walked
home--the trap had been sent away early in the day--leaving Adam to
follow in his own time.  He came in earlier than was expected, and seemed
upset about something.  Neither of the elders made any comment.  They all
lit cigarettes, and, as dinner-time was close at hand, went to their
rooms to get ready.

Adam had evidently been thinking in the interval.  He joined the others
in the drawing-room, looking ruffled and impatient--a condition of things
seen for the first time.  The others, with the patience--or the
experience--of age, trusted to time to unfold and explain things.  They
had not long to wait.  After sitting down and standing up several times,
Adam suddenly burst out.

"That fellow seems to think he owns the earth.  Can't he let people
alone!  He seems to think that he has only to throw his handkerchief to
any woman, and be her master."

This outburst was in itself enlightening.  Only thwarted affection in
some guise could produce this feeling in an amiable young man.  Sir
Nathaniel, as an old diplomatist, had a way of understanding, as if by
foreknowledge, the true inwardness of things, and asked suddenly, but in
a matter-of-fact, indifferent voice:

"Was he after Lilla?"

"Yes, and the fellow didn't lose any time either.  Almost as soon as they
met, he began to butter her up, and tell her how beautiful she was.  Why,
before he left her side, he had asked himself to tea to-morrow at Mercy
Farm.  Stupid ass!  He might see that the girl isn't his sort!  I never
saw anything like it.  It was just like a hawk and a pigeon."

As he spoke, Sir Nathaniel turned and looked at Mr. Salton--a keen look
which implied a full understanding.

"Tell us all about it, Adam.  There are still a few minutes before
dinner, and we shall all have better appetites when we have come to some
conclusion on this matter."

"There is nothing to tell, sir; that is the worst of it.  I am bound to
say that there was not a word said that a human being could object to.  He
was very civil, and all that was proper--just what a landlord might be to
a tenant's daughter . . . Yet--yet--well, I don't know how it was, but it
made my blood boil."

"How did the hawk and the pigeon come in?"  Sir Nathaniel's voice was
soft and soothing, nothing of contradiction or overdone curiosity in it--a
tone eminently suited to win confidence.

"I can hardly explain.  I can only say that he looked like a hawk and she
like a dove--and, now that I think of it, that is what they each did look
like; and do look like in their normal condition."

"That is so!" came the soft voice of Sir Nathaniel.

Adam went on:

"Perhaps that early Roman look of his set me off.  But I wanted to
protect her; she seemed in danger."

"She seems in danger, in a way, from all you young men.  I couldn't help
noticing the way that even you looked--as if you wished to absorb her!"

"I hope both you young men will keep your heads cool," put in Mr. Salton.
"You know, Adam, it won't do to have any quarrel between you, especially
so soon after his home-coming and your arrival here.  We must think of
the feelings and happiness of our neighbours; mustn't we?"

"I hope so, sir.  I assure you that, whatever may happen, or even
threaten, I shall obey your wishes in this as in all things."

"Hush!" whispered Sir Nathaniel, who heard the servants in the passage
bringing dinner.

After dinner, over the walnuts and the wine, Sir Nathaniel returned to
the subject of the local legends.

"It will perhaps be a less dangerous topic for us to discuss than more
recent ones."

"All right, sir," said Adam heartily.  "I think you may depend on me now
with regard to any topic.  I can even discuss Mr. Caswall.  Indeed, I may
meet him to-morrow.  He is going, as I said, to call at Mercy Farm at
three o'clock--but I have an appointment at two."

"I notice," said Mr. Salton, "that you do not lose any time."

The two old men once more looked at each other steadily.  Then, lest the
mood of his listener should change with delay, Sir Nathaniel began at
once:

"I don't propose to tell you all the legends of Mercia, or even to make a
selection of them.  It will be better, I think, for our purpose if we
consider a few facts--recorded or unrecorded--about this neighbourhood.  I
think we might begin with Diana's Grove.  It has roots in the different
epochs of our history, and each has its special crop of legend.  The
Druid and the Roman are too far off for matters of detail; but it seems
to me the Saxon and the Angles are near enough to yield material for
legendary lore.  We find that this particular place had another name
besides Diana's Grove.  This was manifestly of Roman origin, or of
Grecian accepted as Roman.  The other is more pregnant of adventure and
romance than the Roman name.  In Mercian tongue it was 'The Lair of the
White Worm.'  This needs a word of explanation at the beginning.

"In the dawn of the language, the word 'worm' had a somewhat different
meaning from that in use to-day.  It was an adaptation of the Anglo-Saxon
'wyrm,' meaning a dragon or snake; or from the Gothic 'waurms,' a
serpent; or the Icelandic 'ormur,' or the German 'wurm.'  We gather that
it conveyed originally an idea of size and power, not as now in the
diminutive of both these meanings.  Here legendary history helps us.  We
have the well-known legend of the 'Worm Well' of Lambton Castle, and that
of the 'Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heugh' near Bamborough.  In both these
legends the 'worm' was a monster of vast size and power--a veritable
dragon or serpent, such as legend attributes to vast fens or quags where
there was illimitable room for expansion.  A glance at a geological map
will show that whatever truth there may have been of the actuality of
such monsters in the early geologic periods, at least there was plenty of
possibility.  In England there were originally vast plains where the
plentiful supply of water could gather.  The streams were deep and slow,
and there were holes of abysmal depth, where any kind and size of
antediluvian monster could find a habitat.  In places, which now we can
see from our windows, were mud-holes a hundred or more feet deep.  Who
can tell us when the age of the monsters which flourished in slime came
to an end?  There must have been places and conditions which made for
greater longevity, greater size, greater strength than was usual.  Such
over-lappings may have come down even to our earlier centuries.  Nay, are
there not now creatures of a vastness of bulk regarded by the generality
of men as impossible?  Even in our own day there are seen the traces of
animals, if not the animals themselves, of stupendous size--veritable
survivals from earlier ages, preserved by some special qualities in their
habitats.  I remember meeting a distinguished man in India, who had the
reputation of being a great shikaree, who told me that the greatest
temptation he had ever had in his life was to shoot a giant snake which
he had come across in the Terai of Upper India.  He was on a
tiger-shooting expedition, and as his elephant was crossing a nullah, it
squealed.  He looked down from his howdah and saw that the elephant had
stepped across the body of a snake which was dragging itself through the
jungle.  'So far as I could see,' he said, 'it must have been eighty or
one hundred feet in length.  Fully forty or fifty feet was on each side
of the track, and though the weight which it dragged had thinned it, it
was as thick round as a man's body.  I suppose you know that when you are
after tiger, it is a point of honour not to shoot at anything else, as
life may depend on it.  I could easily have spined this monster, but I
felt that I must not--so, with regret, I had to let it go.'

"Just imagine such a monster anywhere in this country, and at once we
could get a sort of idea of the 'worms,' which possibly did frequent the
great morasses which spread round the mouths of many of the great
European rivers."

"I haven't the least doubt, sir, that there may have been such monsters
as you have spoken of still existing at a much later period than is
generally accepted," replied Adam.  "Also, if there were such things,
that this was the very place for them.  I have tried to think over the
matter since you pointed out the configuration of the ground.  But it
seems to me that there is a hiatus somewhere.  Are there not mechanical
difficulties?"

"In what way?"

"Well, our antique monster must have been mighty heavy, and the distances
he had to travel were long and the ways difficult.  From where we are now
sitting down to the level of the mud-holes is a distance of several
hundred feet--I am leaving out of consideration altogether any lateral
distance.  Is it possible that there was a way by which a monster could
travel up and down, and yet no chance recorder have ever seen him?  Of
course we have the legends; but is not some more exact evidence necessary
in a scientific investigation?"

"My dear Adam, all you say is perfectly right, and, were we starting on
such an investigation, we could not do better than follow your reasoning.
But, my dear boy, you must remember that all this took place thousands of
years ago.  You must remember, too, that all records of the kind that
would help us are lacking.  Also, that the places to be considered were
desert, so far as human habitation or population are considered.  In the
vast desolation of such a place as complied with the necessary
conditions, there must have been such profusion of natural growth as
would bar the progress of men formed as we are.  The lair of such a
monster would not have been disturbed for hundreds--or thousands--of
years.  Moreover, these creatures must have occupied places quite
inaccessible to man.  A snake who could make himself comfortable in a
quagmire, a hundred feet deep, would be protected on the outskirts by
such stupendous morasses as now no longer exist, or which, if they exist
anywhere at all, can be on very few places on the earth's surface.  Far
be it from me to say that in more elemental times such things could not
have been.  The condition belongs to the geologic age--the great birth
and growth of the world, when natural forces ran riot, when the struggle
for existence was so savage that no vitality which was not founded in a
gigantic form could have even a possibility of survival.  That such a
time existed, we have evidences in geology, but there only; we can never
expect proofs such as this age demands.  We can only imagine or surmise
such things--or such conditions and such forces as overcame them."




CHAPTER VI--HAWK AND PIGEON


At breakfast-time next morning Sir Nathaniel and Mr. Salton were seated
when Adam came hurriedly into the room.

"Any news?" asked his uncle mechanically.

"Four."

"Four what?" asked Sir Nathaniel.

"Snakes," said Adam, helping himself to a grilled kidney.

"Four snakes.  I don't understand."

"Mongoose," said Adam, and then added explanatorily: "I was out with the
mongoose just after three."

"Four snakes in one morning!  Why, I didn't know there were so many on
the Brow"--the local name for the western cliff.  "I hope that wasn't the
consequence of our talk of last night?"

"It was, sir.  But not directly."

"But, God bless my soul, you didn't expect to get a snake like the
Lambton worm, did you?  Why, a mongoose, to tackle a monster like that--if
there were one--would have to be bigger than a haystack."

"These were ordinary snakes, about as big as a walking-stick."

"Well, it's pleasant to be rid of them, big or little.  That is a good
mongoose, I am sure; he'll clear out all such vermin round here," said
Mr. Salton.

Adam went quietly on with his breakfast.  Killing a few snakes in a
morning was no new experience to him.  He left the room the moment
breakfast was finished and went to the study that his uncle had arranged
for him.  Both Sir Nathaniel and Mr. Salton took it that he wanted to be
by himself, so as to avoid any questioning or talk of the visit that he
was to make that afternoon.  They saw nothing further of him till about
half-an-hour before dinner-time.  Then he came quietly into the smoking-
room, where Mr. Salton and Sir Nathaniel were sitting together, ready
dressed.

"I suppose there is no use waiting.  We had better get it over at once,"
remarked Adam.

His uncle, thinking to make things easier for him, said: "Get what over?"

There was a sign of shyness about him at this.  He stammered a little at
first, but his voice became more even as he went on.

"My visit to Mercy Farm."

Mr. Salton waited eagerly.  The old diplomatist simply smiled.

"I suppose you both know that I was much interested yesterday in the
Watfords?"  There was no denial or fending off the question.  Both the
old men smiled acquiescence.  Adam went on: "I meant you to see it--both
of you.  You, uncle, because you are my uncle and the nearest of my own
kin, and, moreover, you couldn't have been more kind to me or made me
more welcome if you had been my own father."  Mr. Salton said nothing.  He
simply held out his hand, and the other took it and held it for a few
seconds.  "And you, sir, because you have shown me something of the same
affection which in my wildest dreams of home I had no right to expect."
He stopped for an instant, much moved.

Sir Nathaniel answered softly, laying his hand on the youth's shoulder.

"You are right, my boy; quite right.  That is the proper way to look at
it.  And I may tell you that we old men, who have no children of our own,
feel our hearts growing warm when we hear words like those."

Then Adam hurried on, speaking with a rush, as if he wanted to come to
the crucial point.

"Mr. Watford had not come in, but Lilla and Mimi were at home, and they
made me feel very welcome.  They have all a great regard for my uncle.  I
am glad of that any way, for I like them all--much.  We were having tea,
when Mr. Caswall came to the door, attended by the negro.  Lilla opened
the door herself.  The window of the living-room at the farm is a large
one, and from within you cannot help seeing anyone coming.  Mr. Caswall
said he had ventured to call, as he wished to make the acquaintance of
all his tenants, in a less formal way, and more individually, than had
been possible to him on the previous day.  The girls made him
welcome--they are very sweet girls those, sir; someone will be very happy
some day there--with either of them."

"And that man may be you, Adam," said Mr. Salton heartily.

A sad look came over the young man's eyes, and the fire his uncle had
seen there died out.  Likewise the timbre left his voice, making it sound
lonely.

"Such might crown my life.  But that happiness, I fear, is not for me--or
not without pain and loss and woe."

"Well, it's early days yet!" cried Sir Nathaniel heartily.

The young man turned on him his eyes, which had now grown excessively
sad.

"Yesterday--a few hours ago--that remark would have given me new hope--new
courage; but since then I have learned too much."

The old man, skilled in the human heart, did not attempt to argue in such
a matter.

"Too early to give in, my boy."

"I am not of a giving-in kind," replied the young man earnestly.  "But,
after all, it is wise to realise a truth.  And when a man, though he is
young, feels as I do--as I have felt ever since yesterday, when I first
saw Mimi's eyes--his heart jumps.  He does not need to learn things.  He
knows."

There was silence in the room, during which the twilight stole on
imperceptibly.  It was Adam who again broke the silence.

"Do you know, uncle, if we have any second sight in our family?"

"No, not that I ever heard about.  Why?"

"Because," he answered slowly, "I have a conviction which seems to answer
all the conditions of second sight."

"And then?" asked the old man, much perturbed.

"And then the usual inevitable.  What in the Hebrides and other places,
where the Sight is a cult--a belief--is called 'the doom'--the court from
which there is no appeal.  I have often heard of second sight--we have
many western Scots in Australia; but I have realised more of its true
inwardness in an instant of this afternoon than I did in the whole of my
life previously--a granite wall stretching up to the very heavens, so
high and so dark that the eye of God Himself cannot see beyond.  Well, if
the Doom must come, it must.  That is all."

The voice of Sir Nathaniel broke in, smooth and sweet and grave.

"Can there not be a fight for it?  There can for most things."

"For most things, yes, but for the Doom, no.  What a man can do I shall
do.  There will be--must be--a fight.  When and where and how I know not,
but a fight there will be.  But, after all, what is a man in such a
case?"

"Adam, there are three of us."  Salton looked at his old friend as he
spoke, and that old friend's eyes blazed.

"Ay, three of us," he said, and his voice rang.

There was again a pause, and Sir Nathaniel endeavoured to get back to
less emotional and more neutral ground.

"Tell us of the rest of the meeting.  Remember we are all pledged to
this.  It is a fight _a l'outrance_, and we can afford to throw away or
forgo no chance."

"We shall throw away or lose nothing that we can help.  We fight to win,
and the stake is a life--perhaps more than one--we shall see."  Then he
went on in a conversational tone, such as he had used when he spoke of
the coming to the farm of Edgar Caswall: "When Mr. Caswall came in, the
negro went a short distance away and there remained.  It gave me the idea
that he expected to be called, and intended to remain in sight, or within
hail.  Then Mimi got another cup and made fresh tea, and we all went on
together."

"Was there anything uncommon--were you all quite friendly?" asked Sir
Nathaniel quietly.

"Quite friendly.  There was nothing that I could notice out of the
common--except," he went on, with a slight hardening of the voice,
"except that he kept his eyes fixed on Lilla, in a way which was quite
intolerable to any man who might hold her dear."

"Now, in what way did he look?" asked Sir Nathaniel.

"There was nothing in itself offensive; but no one could help noticing
it."

"You did.  Miss Watford herself, who was the victim, and Mr. Caswall, who
was the offender, are out of range as witnesses.  Was there anyone else
who noticed?"

"Mimi did.  Her face flamed with anger as she saw the look."

"What kind of look was it?  Over-ardent or too admiring, or what?  Was it
the look of a lover, or one who fain would be?  You understand?"

"Yes, sir, I quite understand.  Anything of that sort I should of course
notice.  It would be part of my preparation for keeping my
self-control--to which I am pledged."

"If it were not amatory, was it threatening?  Where was the offence?"

Adam smiled kindly at the old man.

"It was not amatory.  Even if it was, such was to be expected.  I should
be the last man in the world to object, since I am myself an offender in
that respect.  Moreover, not only have I been taught to fight fair, but
by nature I believe I am just.  I would be as tolerant of and as liberal
to a rival as I should expect him to be to me.  No, the look I mean was
nothing of that kind.  And so long as it did not lack proper respect, I
should not of my own part condescend to notice it.  Did you ever study
the eyes of a hound?"

"At rest?"

"No, when he is following his instincts!  Or, better still," Adam went
on, "the eyes of a bird of prey when he is following his instincts.  Not
when he is swooping, but merely when he is watching his quarry?"

"No," said Sir Nathaniel, "I don't know that I ever did.  Why, may I
ask?"

"That was the look.  Certainly not amatory or anything of that kind--yet
it was, it struck me, more dangerous, if not so deadly as an actual
threatening."

Again there was a silence, which Sir Nathaniel broke as he stood up:

"I think it would be well if we all thought over this by ourselves.  Then
we can renew the subject."




CHAPTER VII--OOLANGA


Mr. Salton had an appointment for six o'clock at Liverpool.  When he had
driven off, Sir Nathaniel took Adam by the arm.

"May I come with you for a while to your study?  I want to speak to you
privately without your uncle knowing about it, or even what the subject
is.  You don't mind, do you?  It is not idle curiosity.  No, no.  It is
on the subject to which we are all committed."

"Is it necessary to keep my uncle in the dark about it?  He might be
offended."

"It is not necessary; but it is advisable.  It is for his sake that I
asked.  My friend is an old man, and it might concern him unduly--even
alarm him.  I promise you there shall be nothing that could cause him
anxiety in our silence, or at which he could take umbrage."

"Go on, sir!" said Adam simply.

"You see, your uncle is now an old man.  I know it, for we were boys
together.  He has led an uneventful and somewhat self-contained life, so
that any such condition of things as has now arisen is apt to perplex him
from its very strangeness.  In fact, any new matter is trying to old
people.  It has its own disturbances and its own anxieties, and neither
of these things are good for lives that should be restful.  Your uncle is
a strong man, with a very happy and placid nature.  Given health and
ordinary conditions of life, there is no reason why he should not live to
be a hundred.  You and I, therefore, who both love him, though in
different ways, should make it our business to protect him from all
disturbing influences.  I am sure you will agree with me that any labour
to this end would be well spent.  All right, my boy!  I see your answer
in your eyes; so we need say no more of that.  And now," here his voice
changed, "tell me all that took place at that interview.  There are
strange things in front of us--how strange we cannot at present even
guess.  Doubtless some of the difficult things to understand which lie
behind the veil will in time be shown to us to see and to understand.  In
the meantime, all we can do is to work patiently, fearlessly, and
unselfishly, to an end that we think is right.  You had got so far as
where Lilla opened the door to Mr. Caswall and the negro.  You also
observed that Mimi was disturbed in her mind at the way Mr. Caswall
looked at her cousin."

"Certainly--though 'disturbed' is a poor way of expressing her
objection."

"Can you remember well enough to describe Caswall's eyes, and how Lilla
looked, and what Mimi said and did?  Also Oolanga, Caswall's West African
servant."

"I'll do what I can, sir.  All the time Mr. Caswall was staring, he kept
his eyes fixed and motionless--but not as if he was in a trance.  His
forehead was wrinkled up, as it is when one is trying to see through or
into something.  At the best of times his face has not a gentle
expression; but when it was screwed up like that it was almost
diabolical.  It frightened poor Lilla so that she trembled, and after a
bit got so pale that I thought she had fainted.  However, she held up and
tried to stare back, but in a feeble kind of way.  Then Mimi came close
and held her hand.  That braced her up, and--still, never ceasing her
return stare--she got colour again and seemed more like herself."

"Did he stare too?"

"More than ever.  The weaker Lilla seemed, the stronger he became, just
as if he were feeding on her strength.  All at once she turned round,
threw up her hands, and fell down in a faint.  I could not see what else
happened just then, for Mimi had thrown herself on her knees beside her
and hid her from me.  Then there was something like a black shadow
between us, and there was the nigger, looking more like a malignant devil
than ever.  I am not usually a patient man, and the sight of that ugly
devil is enough to make one's blood boil.  When he saw my face, he seemed
to realise danger--immediate danger--and slunk out of the room as
noiselessly as if he had been blown out.  I learned one thing, however--he
is an enemy, if ever a man had one."

"That still leaves us three to two!" put in Sir Nathaniel.

"Then Caswall slunk out, much as the nigger had done.  When he had gone,
Lilla recovered at once."

"Now," said Sir Nathaniel, anxious to restore peace, "have you found out
anything yet regarding the negro?  I am anxious to be posted regarding
him.  I fear there will be, or may be, grave trouble with him."

"Yes, sir, I've heard a good deal about him--of course it is not
official; but hearsay must guide us at first.  You know my man
Davenport--private secretary, confidential man of business, and general
factotum.  He is devoted to me, and has my full confidence.  I asked him
to stay on board the _West African_ and have a good look round, and find
out what he could about Mr. Caswall.  Naturally, he was struck with the
aboriginal savage.  He found one of the ship's stewards, who had been on
the regular voyages to South Africa.  He knew Oolanga and had made a
study of him.  He is a man who gets on well with niggers, and they open
their hearts to him.  It seems that this Oolanga is quite a great person
in the nigger world of the African West Coast.  He has the two things
which men of his own colour respect: he can make them afraid, and he is
lavish with money.  I don't know whose money--but that does not matter.
They are always ready to trumpet his greatness.  Evil greatness it is--but
neither does that matter.  Briefly, this is his history.  He was
originally a witch-finder--about as low an occupation as exists amongst
aboriginal savages.  Then he got up in the world and became an Obi-man,
which gives an opportunity to wealth _via_ blackmail.  Finally, he
reached the highest honour in hellish service.  He became a user of
Voodoo, which seems to be a service of the utmost baseness and cruelty.  I
was told some of his deeds of cruelty, which are simply sickening.  They
made me long for an opportunity of helping to drive him back to hell.  You
might think to look at him that you could measure in some way the extent
of his vileness; but it would be a vain hope.  Monsters such as he is
belong to an earlier and more rudimentary stage of barbarism.  He is in
his way a clever fellow--for a nigger; but is none the less dangerous or
the less hateful for that.  The men in the ship told me that he was a
collector: some of them had seen his collections.  Such collections!  All
that was potent for evil in bird or beast, or even in fish.  Beaks that
could break and rend and tear--all the birds represented were of a
predatory kind.  Even the fishes are those which are born to destroy, to
wound, to torture.  The collection, I assure you, was an object lesson in
human malignity.  This being has enough evil in his face to frighten even
a strong man.  It is little wonder that the sight of it put that poor
girl into a dead faint!"

Nothing more could be done at the moment, so they separated.

Adam was up in the early morning and took a smart walk round the Brow.  As
he was passing Diana's Grove, he looked in on the short avenue of trees,
and noticed the snakes killed on the previous morning by the mongoose.
They all lay in a row, straight and rigid, as if they had been placed by
hands.  Their skins seemed damp and sticky, and they were covered all
over with ants and other insects.  They looked loathsome, so after a
glance, he passed on.

A little later, when his steps took him, naturally enough, past the
entrance to Mercy Farm, he was passed by the negro, moving quickly under
the trees wherever there was shadow.  Laid across one extended arm,
looking like dirty towels across a rail, he had the horrid-looking
snakes.  He did not seem to see Adam.  No one was to be seen at Mercy
except a few workmen in the farmyard, so, after waiting on the chance of
seeing Mimi, Adam began to go slowly home.

Once more he was passed on the way.  This time it was by Lady Arabella,
walking hurriedly and so furiously angry that she did not recognise him,
even to the extent of acknowledging his bow.

When Adam got back to Lesser Hill, he went to the coach-house where the
box with the mongoose was kept, and took it with him, intending to finish
at the Mound of Stone what he had begun the previous morning with regard
to the extermination.  He found that the snakes were even more easily
attacked than on the previous day; no less than six were killed in the
first half-hour.  As no more appeared, he took it for granted that the
morning's work was over, and went towards home.  The mongoose had by this
time become accustomed to him, and was willing to let himself be handled
freely.  Adam lifted him up and put him on his shoulder and walked on.
Presently he saw a lady advancing towards him, and recognised Lady
Arabella.

Hitherto the mongoose had been quiet, like a playful affectionate kitten;
but when the two got close, Adam was horrified to see the mongoose, in a
state of the wildest fury, with every hair standing on end, jump from his
shoulder and run towards Lady Arabella.  It looked so furious and so
intent on attack that he called a warning.

"Look out--look out!  The animal is furious and means to attack."

Lady Arabella looked more than ever disdainful and was passing on; the
mongoose jumped at her in a furious attack.  Adam rushed forward with his
stick, the only weapon he had.  But just as he got within striking
distance, the lady drew out a revolver and shot the animal, breaking his
backbone.  Not satisfied with this, she poured shot after shot into him
till the magazine was exhausted.  There was no coolness or hauteur about
her now; she seemed more furious even than the animal, her face
transformed with hate, and as determined to kill as he had appeared to
be.  Adam, not knowing exactly what to do, lifted his hat in apology and
hurried on to Lesser Hill.




CHAPTER VIII--SURVIVALS


At breakfast Sir Nathaniel noticed that Adam was put out about something,
but he said nothing.  The lesson of silence is better remembered in age
than in youth.  When they were both in the study, where Sir Nathaniel
followed him, Adam at once began to tell his companion of what had
happened.  Sir Nathaniel looked graver and graver as the narration
proceeded, and when Adam had stopped he remained silent for several
minutes, before speaking.

"This is very grave.  I have not formed any opinion yet; but it seems to
me at first impression that this is worse than anything I had expected."

"Why, sir?" said Adam.  "Is the killing of a mongoose--no matter by
whom--so serious a thing as all that?"

His companion smoked on quietly for quite another few minutes before he
spoke.

"When I have properly thought it over I may moderate my opinion, but in
the meantime it seems to me that there is something dreadful behind all
this--something that may affect all our lives--that may mean the issue of
life or death to any of us."

Adam sat up quickly.

"Do tell me, sir, what is in your mind--if, of course, you have no
objection, or do not think it better to withhold it."

"I have no objection, Adam--in fact, if I had, I should have to overcome
it.  I fear there can be no more reserved thoughts between us."

"Indeed, sir, that sounds serious, worse than serious!"

"Adam, I greatly fear that the time has come for us--for you and me, at
all events--to speak out plainly to one another.  Does not there seem
something very mysterious about this?"

"I have thought so, sir, all along.  The only difficulty one has is what
one is to think and where to begin."

"Let us begin with what you have told me.  First take the conduct of the
mongoose.  He was quiet, even friendly and affectionate with you.  He
only attacked the snakes, which is, after all, his business in life."

"That is so!"

"Then we must try to find some reason why he attacked Lady Arabella."

"May it not be that a mongoose may have merely the instinct to attack,
that nature does not allow or provide him with the fine reasoning powers
to discriminate who he is to attack?"

"Of course that may be so.  But, on the other hand, should we not satisfy
ourselves why he does wish to attack anything?  If for centuries, this
particular animal is known to attack only one kind of other animal, are
we not justified in assuming that when one of them attacks a hitherto
unclassed animal, he recognises in that animal some quality which it has
in common with the hereditary enemy?"

"That is a good argument, sir," Adam went on, "but a dangerous one.  If
we followed it out, it would lead us to believe that Lady Arabella is a
snake."

"We must be sure, before going to such an end, that there is no point as
yet unconsidered which would account for the unknown thing which puzzles
us."

"In what way?"

"Well, suppose the instinct works on some physical basis--for instance,
smell.  If there were anything in recent juxtaposition to the attacked
which would carry the scent, surely that would supply the missing cause."

"Of course!" Adam spoke with conviction.

"Now, from what you tell me, the negro had just come from the direction
of Diana's Grove, carrying the dead snakes which the mongoose had killed
the previous morning.  Might not the scent have been carried that way?"

"Of course it might, and probably was.  I never thought of that.  Is
there any possible way of guessing approximately how long a scent will
remain?  You see, this is a natural scent, and may derive from a place
where it has been effective for thousands of years.  Then, does a scent
of any kind carry with it any form or quality of another kind, either
good or evil?  I ask you because one ancient name of the house lived in
by the lady who was attacked by the mongoose was 'The Lair of the White
Worm.'  If any of these things be so, our difficulties have multiplied
indefinitely.  They may even change in kind.  We may get into moral
entanglements; before we know it, we may be in the midst of a struggle
between good and evil."

Sir Nathaniel smiled gravely.

"With regard to the first question--so far as I know, there are no fixed
periods for which a scent may be active--I think we may take it that that
period does not run into thousands of years.  As to whether any moral
change accompanies a physical one, I can only say that I have met no
proof of the fact.  At the same time, we must remember that 'good' and
'evil' are terms so wide as to take in the whole scheme of creation, and
all that is implied by them and by their mutual action and reaction.
Generally, I would say that in the scheme of a First Cause anything is
possible.  So long as the inherent forces or tendencies of any one thing
are veiled from us we must expect mystery."

"There is one other question on which I should like to ask your opinion.
Suppose that there are any permanent forces appertaining to the past,
what we may call 'survivals,' do these belong to good as well as to evil?
For instance, if the scent of the primaeval monster can so remain in
proportion to the original strength, can the same be true of things of
good import?"

Sir Nathaniel thought for a while before he answered.

"We must be careful not to confuse the physical and the moral.  I can see
that already you have switched on the moral entirely, so perhaps we had
better follow it up first.  On the side of the moral, we have certain
justification for belief in the utterances of revealed religion.  For
instance, 'the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much'
is altogether for good.  We have nothing of a similar kind on the side of
evil.  But if we accept this dictum we need have no more fear of
'mysteries': these become thenceforth merely obstacles."

Adam suddenly changed to another phase of the subject.

"And now, sir, may I turn for a few minutes to purely practical things,
or rather to matters of historical fact?"

Sir Nathaniel bowed acquiescence.

"We have already spoken of the history, so far as it is known, of some of
the places round us--'Castra Regis,' 'Diana's Grove,' and 'The Lair of
the White Worm.'  I would like to ask if there is anything not
necessarily of evil import about any of the places?"

"Which?" asked Sir Nathaniel shrewdly.

"Well, for instance, this house and Mercy Farm?"

"Here we turn," said Sir Nathaniel, "to the other side, the light side of
things.  Let us take Mercy Farm first.  When Augustine was sent by Pope
Gregory to Christianise England, in the time of the Romans, he was
received and protected by Ethelbert, King of Kent, whose wife, daughter
of Charibert, King of Paris, was a Christian, and did much for Augustine.
She founded a nunnery in memory of Columba, which was named _Sedes
misericordioe_, the House of Mercy, and, as the region was Mercian, the
two names became involved.  As Columba is the Latin for dove, the dove
became a sort of signification of the nunnery.  She seized on the idea
and made the newly-founded nunnery a house of doves.  Someone sent her a
freshly-discovered dove, a sort of carrier, but which had in the white
feathers of its head and neck the form of a religious cowl.  The nunnery
flourished for more than a century, when, in the time of Penda, who was
the reactionary of heathendom, it fell into decay.  In the meantime the
doves, protected by religious feeling, had increased mightily, and were
known in all Catholic communities.  When King Offa ruled in Mercia, about
a hundred and fifty years later, he restored Christianity, and under its
protection the nunnery of St. Columba was restored and its doves
flourished again.  In process of time this religious house again fell
into desuetude; but before it disappeared it had achieved a great name
for good works, and in especial for the piety of its members.  If deeds
and prayers and hopes and earnest thinking leave anywhere any moral
effect, Mercy Farm and all around it have almost the right to be
considered holy ground."

"Thank you, sir," said Adam earnestly, and was silent.  Sir Nathaniel
understood.

After lunch that day, Adam casually asked Sir Nathaniel to come for a
walk with him.  The keen-witted old diplomatist guessed that there must
be some motive behind the suggestion, and he at once agreed.

As soon as they were free from observation, Adam began.

"I am afraid, sir, that there is more going on in this neighbourhood than
most people imagine.  I was out this morning, and on the edge of the
small wood, I came upon the body of a child by the roadside.  At first, I
thought she was dead, and while examining her, I noticed on her neck some
marks that looked like those of teeth."

"Some wild dog, perhaps?" put in Sir Nathaniel.

"Possibly, sir, though I think not--but listen to the rest of my news.  I
glanced around, and to my surprise, I noticed something white moving
among the trees.  I placed the child down carefully, and followed, but I
could not find any further traces.  So I returned to the child and
resumed my examination, and, to my delight, I discovered that she was
still alive.  I chafed her hands and gradually she revived, but to my
disappointment she remembered nothing--except that something had crept up
quietly from behind, and had gripped her round the throat.  Then,
apparently, she fainted."

"Gripped her round the throat!  Then it cannot have been a dog."

"No, sir, that is my difficulty, and explains why I brought you out here,
where we cannot possibly be overheard.  You have noticed, of course, the
peculiar sinuous way in which Lady Arabella moves--well, I feel certain
that the white thing that I saw in the wood was the mistress of Diana's
Grove!"

"Good God, boy, be careful what you say."

"Yes, sir, I fully realise the gravity of my accusation, but I feel
convinced that the marks on the child's throat were human--and made by a
woman."

Adam's companion remained silent for some time, deep in thought.

"Adam, my boy," he said at last, "this matter appears to me to be far
more serious even than you think.  It forces me to break confidence with
my old friend, your uncle--but, in order to spare him, I must do so.  For
some time now, things have been happening in this district that have been
worrying him dreadfully--several people have disappeared, without leaving
the slightest trace; a dead child was found by the roadside, with no
visible or ascertainable cause of death--sheep and other animals have
been found in the fields, bleeding from open wounds.  There have been
other matters--many of them apparently trivial in themselves.  Some
sinister influence has been at work, and I admit that I have suspected
Lady Arabella--that is why I questioned you so closely about the mongoose
and its strange attack upon Lady Arabella.  You will think it strange
that I should suspect the mistress of Diana's Grove, a beautiful woman of
aristocratic birth.  Let me explain--the family seat is near my own
place, Doom Tower, and at one time I knew the family well.  When still a
young girl, Lady Arabella wandered into a small wood near her home, and
did not return.  She was found unconscious and in a high fever--the
doctor said that she had received a poisonous bite, and the girl being at
a delicate and critical age, the result was serious--so much so that she
was not expected to recover.  A great London physician came down but
could do nothing--indeed, he said that the girl would not survive the
night.  All hope had been abandoned, when, to everyone's surprise, Lady
Arabella made a sudden and startling recovery.  Within a couple of days
she was going about as usual!  But to the horror of her people, she
developed a terrible craving for cruelty, maiming and injuring birds and
small animals--even killing them.  This was put down to a nervous
disturbance due to her age, and it was hoped that her marriage to Captain
March would put this right.  However, it was not a happy marriage, and
eventually her husband was found shot through the head.  I have always
suspected suicide, though no pistol was found near the body.  He may have
discovered something--God knows what!--so possibly Lady Arabella may
herself have killed him.  Putting together many small matters that have
come to my knowledge, I have come to the conclusion that the foul White
Worm obtained control of her body, just as her soul was leaving its
earthly tenement--that would explain the sudden revival of energy, the
strange and inexplicable craving for maiming and killing, as well as many
other matters with which I need not trouble you now, Adam.  As I said
just now, God alone knows what poor Captain March discovered--it must
have been something too ghastly for human endurance, if my theory is
correct that the once beautiful human body of Lady Arabella is under the
control of this ghastly White Worm."

Adam nodded.

"But what can we do, sir--it seems a most difficult problem."

"We can do nothing, my boy--that is the important part of it.  It would
be impossible to take action--all we can do is to keep careful watch,
especially as regards Lady Arabella, and be ready to act, promptly and
decisively, if the opportunity occurs."

Adam agreed, and the two men returned to Lesser Hill.




CHAPTER IX--SMELLING DEATH


Adam Salton, though he talked little, did not let the grass grow under
his feet in any matter which he had undertaken, or in which he was
interested.  He had agreed with Sir Nathaniel that they should not do
anything with regard to the mystery of Lady Arabella's fear of the
mongoose, but he steadily pursued his course in being _prepared_ to act
whenever the opportunity might come.  He was in his own mind perpetually
casting about for information or clues which might lead to possible lines
of action.  Baffled by the killing of the mongoose, he looked around for
another line to follow.  He was fascinated by the idea of there being a
mysterious link between the woman and the animal, but he was already
preparing a second string to his bow.  His new idea was to use the
faculties of Oolanga, so far as he could, in the service of discovery.
His first move was to send Davenport to Liverpool to try to find the
steward of the _West African_, who had told him about Oolanga, and if
possible secure any further information, and then try to induce (by
bribery or other means) the nigger to come to the Brow.  So soon as he
himself could have speech of the Voodoo-man he would be able to learn
from him something useful.  Davenport was successful in his missions, for
he had to get another mongoose, and he was able to tell Adam that he had
seen the steward, who told him much that he wanted to know, and had also
arranged for Oolanga to come to Lesser Hill the following day.  At this
point Adam saw his way sufficiently clear to admit Davenport to some
extent into his confidence.  He had come to the conclusion that it would
be better--certainly at first--not himself to appear in the matter, with
which Davenport was fully competent to deal.  It would be time for
himself to take a personal part when matters had advanced a little
further.

If what the nigger said was in any wise true, the man had a rare gift
which might be useful in the quest they were after.  He could, as it
were, "smell death."  If any one was dead, if any one had died, or if a
place had been used in connection with death, he seemed to know the broad
fact by intuition.  Adam made up his mind that to test this faculty with
regard to several places would be his first task.  Naturally he was
anxious, and the time passed slowly.  The only comfort was the arrival
the next morning of a strong packing case, locked, from Ross, the key
being in the custody of Davenport.  In the case were two smaller boxes,
both locked.  One of them contained a mongoose to replace that killed by
Lady Arabella; the other was the special mongoose which had already
killed the king-cobra in Nepaul.  When both the animals had been safely
put under lock and key, he felt that he might breathe more freely.  No
one was allowed to know the secret of their existence in the house,
except himself and Davenport.  He arranged that Davenport should take
Oolanga round the neighbourhood for a walk, stopping at each of the
places which he designated.  Having gone all along the Brow, he was to
return the same way and induce him to touch on the same subjects in
talking with Adam, who was to meet them as if by chance at the farthest
part--that beyond Mercy Farm.

The incidents of the day proved much as Adam expected.  At Mercy Farm, at
Diana's Grove, at Castra Regis, and a few other spots, the negro stopped
and, opening his wide nostrils as if to sniff boldly, said that he
smelled death.  It was not always in the same form.  At Mercy Farm he
said there were many small deaths.  At Diana's Grove his bearing was
different.  There was a distinct sense of enjoyment about him, especially
when he spoke of many great deaths.  Here, too, he sniffed in a strange
way, like a bloodhound at check, and looked puzzled.  He said no word in
either praise or disparagement, but in the centre of the Grove, where,
hidden amongst ancient oak stumps, was a block of granite slightly
hollowed on the top, he bent low and placed his forehead on the ground.
This was the only place where he showed distinct reverence.  At the
Castle, though he spoke of much death, he showed no sign of respect.

There was evidently something about Diana's Grove which both interested
and baffled him.  Before leaving, he moved all over the place
unsatisfied, and in one spot, close to the edge of the Brow, where there
was a deep hollow, he appeared to be afraid.  After returning several
times to this place, he suddenly turned and ran in a panic of fear to the
higher ground, crossing as he did so the outcropping rock.  Then he
seemed to breathe more freely, and recovered some of his jaunty
impudence.

All this seemed to satisfy Adam's expectations.  He went back to Lesser
Hill with a serene and settled calm upon him.  Sir Nathaniel followed him
into his study.

"By the way, I forgot to ask you details about one thing.  When that
extraordinary staring episode of Mr. Caswall went on, how did Lilla take
it--how did she bear herself?"

"She looked frightened, and trembled just as I have seen a pigeon with a
hawk, or a bird with a serpent."

"Thanks.  It is just as I expected.  There have been circumstances in the
Caswall family which lead one to believe that they have had from the
earliest times some extraordinary mesmeric or hypnotic faculty.  Indeed,
a skilled eye could read so much in their physiognomy.  That shot of
yours, whether by instinct or intention, of the hawk and the pigeon was
peculiarly apposite.  I think we may settle on that as a fixed trait to
be accepted throughout our investigation."

When dusk had fallen, Adam took the new mongoose--not the one from
Nepaul--and, carrying the box slung over his shoulder, strolled towards
Diana's Grove.  Close to the gateway he met Lady Arabella, clad as usual
in tightly fitting white, which showed off her slim figure.

To his intense astonishment the mongoose allowed her to pet him, take him
up in her arms and fondle him.  As she was going in his direction, they
walked on together.

Round the roadway between the entrances of Diana's Grove and Lesser Hill
were many trees, with not much foliage except at the top.  In the dusk
this place was shadowy, and the view was hampered by the clustering
trunks.  In the uncertain, tremulous light which fell through the tree-
tops, it was hard to distinguish anything clearly, and at last, somehow,
he lost sight of her altogether, and turned back on his track to find
her.  Presently he came across her close to her own gate.  She was
leaning over the paling of split oak branches which formed the paling of
the avenue.  He could not see the mongoose, so he asked her where it had
gone.

"He slipt out of my arms while I was petting him," she answered, "and
disappeared under the hedges."

They found him at a place where the avenue widened so as to let carriages
pass each other.  The little creature seemed quite changed.  He had been
ebulliently active; now he was dull and spiritless--seemed to be dazed.
He allowed himself to be lifted by either of the pair; but when he was
alone with Lady Arabella he kept looking round him in a strange way, as
though trying to escape.  When they had come out on the roadway Adam held
the mongoose tight to him, and, lifting his hat to his companion, moved
quickly towards Lesser Hill; he and Lady Arabella lost sight of each
other in the thickening gloom.

When Adam got home, he put the mongoose in his box, and locked the door
of the room.  The other mongoose--the one from Nepaul--was safely locked
in his own box, but he lay quiet and did not stir.  When he got to his
study Sir Nathaniel came in, shutting the door behind him.

"I have come," he said, "while we have an opportunity of being alone, to
tell you something of the Caswall family which I think will interest you.
There is, or used to be, a belief in this part of the world that the
Caswall family had some strange power of making the wills of other
persons subservient to their own.  There are many allusions to the
subject in memoirs and other unimportant works, but I only know of one
where the subject is spoken of definitely.  It is _Mercia and its
Worthies_, written by Ezra Toms more than a hundred years ago.  The
author goes into the question of the close association of the then Edgar
Caswall with Mesmer in Paris.  He speaks of Caswall being a pupil and the
fellow worker of Mesmer, and states that though, when the latter left
France, he took away with him a vast quantity of philosophical and
electric instruments, he was never known to use them again.  He once made
it known to a friend that he had given them to his old pupil.  The term
he used was odd, for it was 'bequeathed,' but no such bequest of Mesmer
was ever made known.  At any rate the instruments were missing, and never
turned up."

A servant came into the room to tell Adam that there was some strange
noise coming from the locked room into which he had gone when he came in.
He hurried off to the place at once, Sir Nathaniel going with him.  Having
locked the door behind them, Adam opened the packing-case where the boxes
of the two mongooses were locked up.  There was no sound from one of
them, but from the other a queer restless struggling.  Having opened both
boxes, he found that the noise was from the Nepaul animal, which,
however, became quiet at once.  In the other box the new mongoose lay
dead, with every appearance of having been strangled!




CHAPTER X--THE KITE


On the following day, a little after four o'clock, Adam set out for
Mercy.

He was home just as the clocks were striking six.  He was pale and upset,
but otherwise looked strong and alert.  The old man summed up his
appearance and manner thus: "Braced up for battle."

"Now!" said Sir Nathaniel, and settled down to listen, looking at Adam
steadily and listening attentively that he might miss nothing--even the
inflection of a word.

"I found Lilla and Mimi at home.  Watford had been detained by business
on the farm.  Miss Watford received me as kindly as before; Mimi, too,
seemed glad to see me.  Mr. Caswall came so soon after I arrived, that
he, or someone on his behalf, must have been watching for me.  He was
followed closely by the negro, who was puffing hard as if he had been
running--so it was probably he who watched.  Mr. Caswall was very cool
and collected, but there was a more than usually iron look about his face
that I did not like.  However, we got on very well.  He talked pleasantly
on all sorts of questions.  The nigger waited a while and then
disappeared as on the other occasion.  Mr. Caswall's eyes were as usual
fixed on Lilla.  True, they seemed to be very deep and earnest, but there
was no offence in them.  Had it not been for the drawing down of the
brows and the stern set of the jaws, I should not at first have noticed
anything.  But the stare, when presently it began, increased in
intensity.  I could see that Lilla began to suffer from nervousness, as
on the first occasion; but she carried herself bravely.  However, the
more nervous she grew, the harder Mr. Caswall stared.  It was evident to
me that he had come prepared for some sort of mesmeric or hypnotic
battle.  After a while he began to throw glances round him and then
raised his hand, without letting either Lilla or Mimi see the action.  It
was evidently intended to give some sign to the negro, for he came, in
his usual stealthy way, quietly in by the hall door, which was open.  Then
Mr. Caswall's efforts at staring became intensified, and poor Lilla's
nervousness grew greater.  Mimi, seeing that her cousin was distressed,
came close to her, as if to comfort or strengthen her with the
consciousness of her presence.  This evidently made a difficulty for Mr.
Caswall, for his efforts, without appearing to get feebler, seemed less
effective.  This continued for a little while, to the gain of both Lilla
and Mimi.  Then there was a diversion.  Without word or apology the door
opened, and Lady Arabella March entered the room.  I had seen her coming
through the great window.  Without a word she crossed the room and stood
beside Mr. Caswall.  It really was very like a fight of a peculiar kind;
and the longer it was sustained the more earnest--the fiercer--it grew.
That combination of forces--the over-lord, the white woman, and the black
man--would have cost some--probably all of them--their lives in the
Southern States of America.  To us it was simply horrible.  But all that
you can understand.  This time, to go on in sporting phrase, it was
understood by all to be a 'fight to a finish,' and the mixed group did
not slacken a moment or relax their efforts.  On Lilla the strain began
to tell disastrously.  She grew pale--a patchy pallor, which meant that
her nerves were out of order.  She trembled like an aspen, and though she
struggled bravely, I noticed that her legs would hardly support her.  A
dozen times she seemed about to collapse in a faint, but each time, on
catching sight of Mimi's eyes, she made a fresh struggle and pulled
through.

"By now Mr. Caswall's face had lost its appearance of passivity.  His
eyes glowed with a fiery light.  He was still the old Roman in
inflexibility of purpose; but grafted on to the Roman was a new Berserker
fury.  His companions in the baleful work seemed to have taken on
something of his feeling.  Lady Arabella looked like a soulless, pitiless
being, not human, unless it revived old legends of transformed human
beings who had lost their humanity in some transformation or in the sweep
of natural savagery.  As for the negro--well, I can only say that it was
solely due to the self-restraint which you impressed on me that I did not
wipe him out as he stood--without warning, without fair play--without a
single one of the graces of life and death.  Lilla was silent in the
helpless concentration of deadly fear; Mimi was all resolve and
self-forgetfulness, so intent on the soul-struggle in which she was
engaged that there was no possibility of any other thought.  As for
myself, the bonds of will which held me inactive seemed like bands of
steel which numbed all my faculties, except sight and hearing.  We seemed
fixed in an _impasse_.  Something must happen, though the power of
guessing was inactive.  As in a dream, I saw Mimi's hand move restlessly,
as if groping for something.  Mechanically it touched that of Lilla, and
in that instant she was transformed.  It was as if youth and strength
entered afresh into something already dead to sensibility and intention.
As if by inspiration, she grasped the other's band with a force which
blenched the knuckles.  Her face suddenly flamed, as if some divine light
shone through it.  Her form expanded till it stood out majestically.
Lifting her right hand, she stepped forward towards Caswall, and with a
bold sweep of her arm seemed to drive some strange force towards him.
Again and again was the gesture repeated, the man falling back from her
at each movement.  Towards the door he retreated, she following.  There
was a sound as of the cooing sob of doves, which seemed to multiply and
intensify with each second.  The sound from the unseen source rose and
rose as he retreated, till finally it swelled out in a triumphant peal,
as she with a fierce sweep of her arm, seemed to hurl something at her
foe, and he, moving his hands blindly before his face, appeared to be
swept through the doorway and out into the open sunlight.

"All at once my own faculties were fully restored; I could see and hear
everything, and be fully conscious of what was going on.  Even the
figures of the baleful group were there, though dimly seen as through a
veil--a shadowy veil.  I saw Lilla sink down in a swoon, and Mimi throw
up her arms in a gesture of triumph.  As I saw her through the great
window, the sunshine flooded the landscape, which, however, was
momentarily becoming eclipsed by an onrush of a myriad birds."

By the next morning, daylight showed the actual danger which threatened.
From every part of the eastern counties reports were received concerning
the enormous immigration of birds.  Experts were sending--on their own
account, on behalf of learned societies, and through local and imperial
governing bodies--reports dealing with the matter, and suggesting
remedies.

The reports closer to home were even more disturbing.  All day long it
would seem that the birds were coming thicker from all quarters.
Doubtless many were going as well as coming, but the mass seemed never to
get less.  Each bird seemed to sound some note of fear or anger or
seeking, and the whirring of wings never ceased nor lessened.  The air
was full of a muttered throb.  No window or barrier could shut out the
sound, till the ears of any listener became dulled by the ceaseless
murmur.  So monotonous it was, so cheerless, so disheartening, so
melancholy, that all longed, but in vain, for any variety, no matter how
terrible it might be.

The second morning the reports from all the districts round were more
alarming than ever.  Farmers began to dread the coming of winter as they
saw the dwindling of the timely fruitfulness of the earth.  And as yet it
was only a warning of evil, not the evil accomplished; the ground began
to look bare whenever some passing sound temporarily frightened the
birds.

Edgar Caswall tortured his brain for a long time unavailingly, to think
of some means of getting rid of what he, as well as his neighbours, had
come to regard as a plague of birds.  At last he recalled a circumstance
which promised a solution of the difficulty.  The experience was of some
years ago in China, far up-country, towards the head-waters of the Yang-
tze-kiang, where the smaller tributaries spread out in a sort of natural
irrigation scheme to supply the wilderness of paddy-fields.  It was at
the time of the ripening rice, and the myriads of birds which came to
feed on the coming crop was a serious menace, not only to the district,
but to the country at large.  The farmers, who were more or less
afflicted with the same trouble every season, knew how to deal with it.
They made a vast kite, which they caused to be flown over the centre spot
of the incursion.  The kite was shaped like a great hawk; and the moment
it rose into the air the birds began to cower and seek protection--and
then to disappear.  So long as that kite was flying overhead the birds
lay low and the crop was saved.  Accordingly Caswall ordered his men to
construct an immense kite, adhering as well as they could to the lines of
a hawk.  Then he and his men, with a sufficiency of cord, began to fly it
high overhead.  The experience of China was repeated.  The moment the
kite rose, the birds hid or sought shelter.  The following morning, the
kite was still flying high, no bird was to be seen as far as the eye
could reach from Castra Regis.  But there followed in turn what proved
even a worse evil.  All the birds were cowed; their sounds stopped.
Neither song nor chirp was heard--silence seemed to have taken the place
of the normal voices of bird life.  But that was not all.  The silence
spread to all animals.

The fear and restraint which brooded amongst the denizens of the air
began to affect all life.  Not only did the birds cease song or chirp,
but the lowing of the cattle ceased in the fields and the varied sounds
of life died away.  In place of these things was only a soundless gloom,
more dreadful, more disheartening, more soul-killing than any concourse
of sounds, no matter how full of fear and dread.  Pious individuals put
up constant prayers for relief from the intolerable solitude.  After a
little there were signs of universal depression which those who ran might
read.  One and all, the faces of men and women seemed bereft of vitality,
of interest, of thought, and, most of all, of hope.  Men seemed to have
lost the power of expression of their thoughts.  The soundless air seemed
to have the same effect as the universal darkness when men gnawed their
tongues with pain.

From this infliction of silence there was no relief.  Everything was
affected; gloom was the predominant note.  Joy appeared to have passed
away as a factor of life, and this creative impulse had nothing to take
its place.  That giant spot in high air was a plague of evil influence.
It seemed like a new misanthropic belief which had fallen on human
beings, carrying with it the negation of all hope.

After a few days, men began to grow desperate; their very words as well
as their senses seemed to be in chains.  Edgar Caswall again tortured his
brain to find any antidote or palliative of this greater evil than
before.  He would gladly have destroyed the kite, or caused its flying to
cease; but the instant it was pulled down, the birds rose up in even
greater numbers; all those who depended in any way on agriculture sent
pitiful protests to Castra Regis.

It was strange indeed what influence that weird kite seemed to exercise.
Even human beings were affected by it, as if both it and they were
realities.  As for the people at Mercy Farm, it was like a taste of
actual death.  Lilla felt it most.  If she had been indeed a real dove,
with a real kite hanging over her in the air, she could not have been
more frightened or more affected by the terror this created.

Of course, some of those already drawn into the vortex noticed the effect
on individuals.  Those who were interested took care to compare their
information.  Strangely enough, as it seemed to the others, the person
who took the ghastly silence least to heart was the negro.  By nature he
was not sensitive to, or afflicted by, nerves.  This alone would not have
produced the seeming indifference, so they set their minds to discover
the real cause.  Adam came quickly to the conclusion that there was for
him some compensation that the others did not share; and he soon believed
that that compensation was in one form or another the enjoyment of the
sufferings of others.  Thus the black had a never-failing source of
amusement.

Lady Arabella's cold nature rendered her immune to anything in the way of
pain or trouble concerning others.  Edgar Caswall was far too haughty a
person, and too stern of nature, to concern himself about poor or
helpless people, much less the lower order of mere animals.  Mr. Watford,
Mr. Salton, and Sir Nathaniel were all concerned in the issue, partly
from kindness of heart--for none of them could see suffering, even of
wild birds, unmoved--and partly on account of their property, which had
to be protected, or ruin would stare them in the face before long.

Lilla suffered acutely.  As time went on, her face became pinched, and
her eyes dull with watching and crying.  Mimi suffered too on account of
her cousin's suffering.  But as she could do nothing, she resolutely made
up her mind to self-restraint and patience.  Adam's frequent visits
comforted her.




CHAPTER XI--MESMER'S CHEST


After a couple of weeks had passed, the kite seemed to give Edgar Caswall
a new zest for life.  He was never tired of looking at its movements.  He
had a comfortable armchair put out on the tower, wherein he sat sometimes
all day long, watching as though the kite was a new toy and he a child
lately come into possession of it.  He did not seem to have lost interest
in Lilla, for he still paid an occasional visit at Mercy Farm.

Indeed, his feeling towards her, whatever it had been at first, had now
so far changed that it had become a distinct affection of a purely animal
kind.  Indeed, it seemed as though the man's nature had become corrupted,
and that all the baser and more selfish and more reckless qualities had
become more conspicuous.  There was not so much sternness apparent in his
nature, because there was less self-restraint.  Determination had become
indifference.

The visible change in Edgar was that he grew morbid, sad, silent; the
neighbours thought he was going mad.  He became absorbed in the kite, and
watched it not only by day, but often all night long.  It became an
obsession to him.

Caswall took a personal interest in the keeping of the great kite flying.
He had a vast coil of cord efficient for the purpose, which worked on a
roller fixed on the parapet of the tower.  There was a winch for the
pulling in of the slack; the outgoing line being controlled by a racket.
There was invariably one man at least, day and night, on the tower to
attend to it.  At such an elevation there was always a strong wind, and
at times the kite rose to an enormous height, as well as travelling for
great distances laterally.  In fact, the kite became, in a short time,
one of the curiosities of Castra Regis and all around it.  Edgar began to
attribute to it, in his own mind, almost human qualities.  It became to
him a separate entity, with a mind and a soul of its own.  Being idle-
handed all day, he began to apply to what he considered the service of
the kite some of his spare time, and found a new pleasure--a new object
in life--in the old schoolboy game of sending up "runners" to the kite.
The way this is done is to get round pieces of paper so cut that there is
a hole in the centre, through which the string of the kite passes.  The
natural action of the wind-pressure takes the paper along the string, and
so up to the kite itself, no matter how high or how far it may have gone.

In the early days of this amusement Edgar Caswall spent hours.  Hundreds
of such messengers flew along the string, until soon he bethought him of
writing messages on these papers so that he could make known his ideas to
the kite.  It may be that his brain gave way under the opportunities
given by his illusion of the entity of the toy and its power of separate
thought.  From sending messages he came to making direct speech to the
kite--without, however, ceasing to send the runners.  Doubtless, the
height of the tower, seated as it was on the hill-top, the rushing of the
ceaseless wind, the hypnotic effect of the lofty altitude of the speck in
the sky at which he gazed, and the rushing of the paper messengers up the
string till sight of them was lost in distance, all helped to further
affect his brain, undoubtedly giving way under the strain of beliefs and
circumstances which were at once stimulating to the imagination,
occupative of his mind, and absorbing.

The next step of intellectual decline was to bring to bear on the main
idea of the conscious identity of the kite all sorts of subjects which
had imaginative force or tendency of their own.  He had, in Castra Regis,
a large collection of curious and interesting things formed in the past
by his forebears, of similar tastes to his own.  There were all sorts of
strange anthropological specimens, both old and new, which had been
collected through various travels in strange places: ancient Egyptian
relics from tombs and mummies; curios from Australia, New Zealand, and
the South Seas; idols and images--from Tartar ikons to ancient Egyptian,
Persian, and Indian objects of worship; objects of death and torture of
American Indians; and, above all, a vast collection of lethal weapons of
every kind and from every place--Chinese "high pinders," double knives,
Afghan double-edged scimitars made to cut a body in two, heavy knives
from all the Eastern countries, ghost daggers from Thibet, the terrible
kukri of the Ghourka and other hill tribes of India, assassins' weapons
from Italy and Spain, even the knife which was formerly carried by the
slave-drivers of the Mississippi region.  Death and pain of every kind
were fully represented in that gruesome collection.

That it had a fascination for Oolanga goes without saying.  He was never
tired of visiting the museum in the tower, and spent endless hours in
inspecting the exhibits, till he was thoroughly familiar with every
detail of all of them.  He asked permission to clean and polish and
sharpen them--a favour which was readily granted.  In addition to the
above objects, there were many things of a kind to awaken human fear.
Stuffed serpents of the most objectionable and horrid kind; giant insects
from the tropics, fearsome in every detail; fishes and crustaceans
covered with weird spikes; dried octopuses of great size.  Other things,
too, there were, not less deadly though seemingly innocuous--dried fungi,
traps intended for birds, beasts, fishes, reptiles, and insects; machines
which could produce pain of any kind and degree, and the only mercy of
which was the power of producing speedy death.

Caswall, who had never before seen any of these things, except those
which he had collected himself, found a constant amusement and interest
in them.  He studied them, their uses, their mechanism--where there was
such--and their places of origin, until he had an ample and real
knowledge of all concerning them.  Many were secret and intricate, but he
never rested till he found out all the secrets.  When once he had become
interested in strange objects, and the way to use them, he began to
explore various likely places for similar finds.  He began to inquire of
his household where strange lumber was kept.  Several of the men spoke of
old Simon Chester as one who knew everything in and about the house.
Accordingly, he sent for the old man, who came at once.  He was very old,
nearly ninety years of age, and very infirm.  He had been born in the
Castle, and had served its succession of masters--present or absent--ever
since.  When Edgar began to question him on the subject regarding which
he had sent for him, old Simon exhibited much perturbation.  In fact, he
became so frightened that his master, fully believing that he was
concealing something, ordered him to tell at once what remained unseen,
and where it was hidden away.  Face to face with discovery of his secret,
the old man, in a pitiable state of concern, spoke out even more fully
than Mr. Caswall had expected.

"Indeed, indeed, sir, everything is here in the tower that has ever been
put away in my time except--except--" here he began to shake and tremble
it--"except the chest which Mr. Edgar--he who was Mr. Edgar when I first
took service--brought back from France, after he had been with Dr.
Mesmer.  The trunk has been kept in my room for safety; but I shall send
it down here now."

"What is in it?" asked Edgar sharply.

"That I do not know.  Moreover, it is a peculiar trunk, without any
visible means of opening."

"Is there no lock?"

"I suppose so, sir; but I do not know.  There is no keyhole."

"Send it here; and then come to me yourself."

The trunk, a heavy one with steel bands round it, but no lock or keyhole,
was carried in by two men.  Shortly afterwards old Simon attended his
master.  When he came into the room, Mr. Caswall himself went and closed
the door; then he asked:

"How do you open it?"

"I do not know, sir."

"Do you mean to say that you never opened it?"

"Most certainly I say so, your honour.  How could I?  It was entrusted to
me with the other things by my master.  To open it would have been a
breach of trust."

Caswall sneered.

"Quite remarkable!  Leave it with me.  Close the door behind you.
Stay--did no one ever tell you about it--say anything regarding it--make
any remark?"

Old Simon turned pale, and put his trembling hands together.

"Oh, sir, I entreat you not to touch it.  That trunk probably contains
secrets which Dr. Mesmer told my master.  Told them to his ruin!"

"How do you mean?  What ruin?"

"Sir, he it was who, men said, sold his soul to the Evil One; I had
thought that that time and the evil of it had all passed away."

"That will do.  Go away; but remain in your own room, or within call.  I
may want you."

The old man bowed deeply and went out trembling, but without speaking a
word.




CHAPTER XII--THE CHEST OPENED


Left alone in the turret-room, Edgar Caswall carefully locked the door
and hung a handkerchief over the keyhole.  Next, he inspected the
windows, and saw that they were not overlooked from any angle of the main
building.  Then he carefully examined the trunk, going over it with a
magnifying glass.  He found it intact: the steel bands were flawless; the
whole trunk was compact.  After sitting opposite to it for some time, and
the shades of evening beginning to melt into darkness, he gave up the
task and went to his bedroom, after locking the door of the turret-room
behind him and taking away the key.

He woke in the morning at daylight, and resumed his patient but
unavailing study of the metal trunk.  This he continued during the whole
day with the same result--humiliating disappointment, which overwrought
his nerves and made his head ache.  The result of the long strain was
seen later in the afternoon, when he sat locked within the turret-room
before the still baffling trunk, distrait, listless and yet agitated,
sunk in a settled gloom.  As the dusk was falling he told the steward to
send him two men, strong ones.  These he ordered to take the trunk to his
bedroom.  In that room he then sat on into the night, without pausing
even to take any food.  His mind was in a whirl, a fever of excitement.
The result was that when, late in the night, he locked himself in his
room his brain was full of odd fancies; he was on the high road to mental
disturbance.  He lay down on his bed in the dark, still brooding over the
mystery of the closed trunk.

Gradually he yielded to the influences of silence and darkness.  After
lying there quietly for some time, his mind became active again.  But
this time there were round him no disturbing influences; his brain was
active and able to work freely and to deal with memory.  A thousand
forgotten--or only half-known--incidents, fragments of conversations or
theories long ago guessed at and long forgotten, crowded on his mind.  He
seemed to hear again around him the legions of whirring wings to which he
had been so lately accustomed.  Even to himself he knew that that was an
effort of imagination founded on imperfect memory.  But he was content
that imagination should work, for out of it might come some solution of
the mystery which surrounded him.  And in this frame of mind, sleep made
another and more successful essay.  This time he enjoyed peaceful
slumber, restful alike to his wearied body and his overwrought brain.

In his sleep he arose, and, as if in obedience to some influence beyond
and greater than himself, lifted the great trunk and set it on a strong
table at one side of the room, from which he had previously removed a
quantity of books.  To do this, he had to use an amount of strength which
was, he knew, far beyond him in his normal state.  As it was, it seemed
easy enough; everything yielded before his touch.  Then he became
conscious that somehow--how, he never could remember--the chest was open.
He unlocked his door, and, taking the chest on his shoulder, carried it
up to the turret-room, the door of which also he unlocked.  Even at the
time he was amazed at his own strength, and wondered whence it had come.
His mind, lost in conjecture, was too far off to realise more immediate
things.  He knew that the chest was enormously heavy.  He seemed, in a
sort of vision which lit up the absolute blackness around, to see the two
sturdy servant men staggering under its great weight.  He locked himself
again in the turret-room, and laid the opened chest on a table, and in
the darkness began to unpack it, laying out the contents, which were
mainly of metal and glass--great pieces in strange forms--on another
table.  He was conscious of being still asleep, and of acting rather in
obedience to some unseen and unknown command than in accordance with any
reasonable plan, to be followed by results which he understood.  This
phase completed, he proceeded to arrange in order the component parts of
some large instruments, formed mostly of glass.  His fingers seemed to
have acquired a new and exquisite subtlety and even a volition of their
own.  Then weariness of brain came upon him; his head sank down on his
breast, and little by little everything became wrapped in gloom.

He awoke in the early morning in his bedroom, and looked around him, now
clear-headed, in amazement.  In its usual place on the strong table stood
the great steel-hooped chest without lock or key.  But it was now locked.
He arose quietly and stole to the turret-room.  There everything was as
it had been on the previous evening.  He looked out of the window where
high in air flew, as usual, the giant kite.  He unlocked the wicket gate
of the turret stair and went out on the roof.  Close to him was the great
coil of cord on its reel.  It was humming in the morning breeze, and when
he touched the string it sent a quick thrill through hand and arm.  There
was no sign anywhere that there had been any disturbance or displacement
of anything during the night.

Utterly bewildered, he sat down in his room to think.  Now for the first
time he _felt_ that he was asleep and dreaming.  Presently he fell asleep
again, and slept for a long time.  He awoke hungry and made a hearty
meal.  Then towards evening, having locked himself in, he fell asleep
again.  When he woke he was in darkness, and was quite at sea as to his
whereabouts.  He began feeling about the dark room, and was recalled to
the consequences of his position by the breaking of a large piece of
glass.  Having obtained a light, he discovered this to be a glass wheel,
part of an elaborate piece of mechanism which he must in his sleep have
taken from the chest, which was now opened.  He had once again opened it
whilst asleep, but he had no recollection of the circumstances.

Caswall came to the conclusion that there had been some sort of dual
action of his mind, which might lead to some catastrophe or some
discovery of his secret plans; so he resolved to forgo for a while the
pleasure of making discoveries regarding the chest.  To this end, he
applied himself to quite another matter--an investigation of the other
treasures and rare objects in his collections.  He went amongst them in
simple, idle curiosity, his main object being to discover some strange
item which he might use for experiment with the kite.  He had already
resolved to try some runners other than those made of paper.  He had a
vague idea that with such a force as the great kite straining at its
leash, this might be used to lift to the altitude of the kite itself
heavier articles.  His first experiment with articles of little but
increasing weight was eminently successful.  So he added by degrees more
and more weight, until he found out that the lifting power of the kite
was considerable.  He then determined to take a step further, and send to
the kite some of the articles which lay in the steel-hooped chest.  The
last time he had opened it in sleep, it had not been shut again, and he
had inserted a wedge so that he could open it at will.  He made
examination of the contents, but came to the conclusion that the glass
objects were unsuitable.  They were too light for testing weight, and
they were so frail as to be dangerous to send to such a height.

So he looked around for something more solid with which to experiment.
His eye caught sight of an object which at once attracted him.  This was
a small copy of one of the ancient Egyptian gods--that of Bes, who
represented the destructive power of nature.  It was so bizarre and
mysterious as to commend itself to his mad humour.  In lifting it from
the cabinet, he was struck by its great weight in proportion to its size.
He made accurate examination of it by the aid of some instruments, and
came to the conclusion that it was carved from a lump of lodestone.  He
remembered that he had read somewhere of an ancient Egyptian god cut from
a similar substance, and, thinking it over, he came to the conclusion
that he must have read it in Sir Thomas Brown's _Popular Errors_, a book
of the seventeenth century.  He got the book from the library, and looked
out the passage:

"A great example we have from the observation of our learned friend Mr.
Graves, in an AEgyptian idol cut out of Loadstone and found among the
Mummies; which still retains its attraction, though probably taken out of
the mine about two thousand years ago."

The strangeness of the figure, and its being so close akin to his own
nature, attracted him.  He made from thin wood a large circular runner,
and in front of it placed the weighty god, sending it up to the flying
kite along the throbbing cord.




CHAPTER XIII--OOLANGA'S HALLUCINATIONS


During the last few days Lady Arabella had been getting exceedingly
impatient.  Her debts, always pressing, were growing to an embarrassing
amount.  The only hope she had of comfort in life was a good marriage;
but the good marriage on which she had fixed her eye did not seem to move
quickly enough--indeed, it did not seem to move at all--in the right
direction.  Edgar Caswall was not an ardent wooer.  From the very first
he seemed _difficile_, but he had been keeping to his own room ever since
his struggle with Mimi Watford.  On that occasion Lady Arabella had shown
him in an unmistakable way what her feelings were; indeed, she had made
it known to him, in a more overt way than pride should allow, that she
wished to help and support him.  The moment when she had gone across the
room to stand beside him in his mesmeric struggle, had been the very
limit of her voluntary action.  It was quite bitter enough, she felt,
that he did not come to her, but now that she had made that advance, she
felt that any withdrawal on his part would, to a woman of her class, be
nothing less than a flaming insult.  Had she not classed herself with his
nigger servant, an unreformed savage?  Had she not shown her preference
for him at the festival of his home-coming?  Had she not . . . Lady
Arabella was cold-blooded, and she was prepared to go through all that
might be necessary of indifference, and even insult, to become chatelaine
of Castra Regis.  In the meantime, she would show no hurry--she must
wait.  She might, in an unostentatious way, come to him again.  She knew
him now, and could make a keen guess at his desires with regard to Lilla
Watford.  With that secret in her possession, she could bring pressure to
bear on Caswall which would make it no easy matter for him to evade her.
The great difficulty was how to get near him.  He was shut up within his
Castle, and guarded by a defence of convention which she could not pass
without danger of ill repute to herself.  Over this question she thought
and thought for days and nights.  At last she decided that the only way
would be to go to him openly at Castra Regis.  Her rank and position
would make such a thing possible, if carefully done.  She could explain
matters afterwards if necessary.  Then when they were alone, she would
use her arts and her experience to make him commit himself.  After all,
he was only a man, with a man's dislike of difficult or awkward
situations.  She felt quite sufficient confidence in her own womanhood to
carry her through any difficulty which might arise.

From Diana's Grove she heard each day the luncheon-gong from Castra Regis
sound, and knew the hour when the servants would be in the back of the
house.  She would enter the house at that hour, and, pretending that she
could not make anyone hear her, would seek him in his own rooms.  The
tower was, she knew, away from all the usual sounds of the house, and
moreover she knew that the servants had strict orders not to interrupt
him when he was in the turret chamber.  She had found out, partly by the
aid of an opera-glass and partly by judicious questioning, that several
times lately a heavy chest had been carried to and from his room, and
that it rested in the room each night.  She was, therefore, confident
that he had some important work on hand which would keep him busy for
long spells.

Meanwhile, another member of the household at Castra Regis had schemes
which he thought were working to fruition.  A man in the position of a
servant has plenty of opportunity of watching his betters and forming
opinions regarding them.  Oolanga was in his way a clever, unscrupulous
rogue, and he felt that with things moving round him in this great
household there should be opportunities of self-advancement.  Being
unscrupulous and stealthy--and a savage--he looked to dishonest means.  He
saw plainly enough that Lady Arabella was making a dead set at his
master, and he was watchful of the slightest sign of anything which might
enhance this knowledge.  Like the other men in the house, he knew of the
carrying to and fro of the great chest, and had got it into his head that
the care exercised in its porterage indicated that it was full of
treasure.  He was for ever lurking around the turret-rooms on the chance
of making some useful discovery.  But he was as cautious as he was
stealthy, and took care that no one else watched him.

It was thus that the negro became aware of Lady Arabella's venture into
the house, as she thought, unseen.  He took more care than ever, since he
was watching another, that the positions were not reversed.  More than
ever he kept his eyes and ears open and his mouth shut.  Seeing Lady
Arabella gliding up the stairs towards his master's room, he took it for
granted that she was there for no good, and doubled his watching
intentness and caution.

Oolanga was disappointed, but he dared not exhibit any feeling lest it
should betray that he was hiding.  Therefore he slunk downstairs again
noiselessly, and waited for a more favourable opportunity of furthering
his plans.  It must be borne in mind that he thought that the heavy trunk
was full of valuables, and that he believed that Lady Arabella had come
to try to steal it.  His purpose of using for his own advantage the
combination of these two ideas was seen later in the day.  Oolanga
secretly followed her home.  He was an expert at this game, and succeeded
admirably on this occasion.  He watched her enter the private gate of
Diana's Grove, and then, taking a roundabout course and keeping out of
her sight, he at last overtook her in a thick part of the Grove where no
one could see the meeting.

Lady Arabella was much surprised.  She had not seen the negro for several
days, and had almost forgotten his existence.  Oolanga would have been
startled had he known and been capable of understanding the real value
placed on him, his beauty, his worthiness, by other persons, and compared
it with the value in these matters in which he held himself.  Doubtless
Oolanga had his dreams like other men.  In such cases he saw himself as a
young sun-god, as beautiful as the eye of dusky or even white womanhood
had ever dwelt upon.  He would have been filled with all noble and
captivating qualities--or those regarded as such in West Africa.  Women
would have loved him, and would have told him so in the overt and fervid
manner usual in affairs of the heart in the shadowy depths of the forest
of the Gold Coast.

Oolanga came close behind Lady Arabella, and in a hushed voice, suitable
to the importance of his task, and in deference to the respect he had for
her and the place, began to unfold the story of his love.  Lady Arabella
was not usually a humorous person, but no man or woman of the white race
could have checked the laughter which rose spontaneously to her lips.  The
circumstances were too grotesque, the contrast too violent, for subdued
mirth.  The man a debased specimen of one of the most primitive races of
the earth, and of an ugliness which was simply devilish; the woman of
high degree, beautiful, accomplished.  She thought that her first
moment's consideration of the outrage--it was nothing less in her
eyes--had given her the full material for thought.  But every instant
after threw new and varied lights on the affront.  Her indignation was
too great for passion; only irony or satire would meet the situation.  Her
cold, cruel nature helped, and she did not shrink to subject this
ignorant savage to the merciless fire-lash of her scorn.

Oolanga was dimly conscious that he was being flouted; but his anger was
no less keen because of the measure of his ignorance.  So he gave way to
it, as does a tortured beast.  He ground his great teeth together, raved,
stamped, and swore in barbarous tongues and with barbarous imagery.  Even
Lady Arabella felt that it was well she was within reach of help, or he
might have offered her brutal violence--even have killed her.

"Am I to understand," she said with cold disdain, so much more effective
to wound than hot passion, "that you are offering me your love?
Your--love?"

For reply he nodded his head.  The scorn of her voice, in a sort of
baleful hiss, sounded--and felt--like the lash of a whip.

"And you dared! you--a savage--a slave--the basest thing in the world of
vermin!  Take care!  I don't value your worthless life more than I do
that of a rat or a spider.  Don't let me ever see your hideous face here
again, or I shall rid the earth of you."

As she was speaking, she had taken out her revolver and was pointing it
at him.  In the immediate presence of death his impudence forsook him,
and he made a weak effort to justify himself.  His speech was short,
consisting of single words.  To Lady Arabella it sounded mere gibberish,
but it was in his own dialect, and meant love, marriage, wife.  From the
intonation of the words, she guessed, with her woman's quick intuition,
at their meaning; but she quite failed to follow, when, becoming more
pressing, he continued to urge his suit in a mixture of the grossest
animal passion and ridiculous threats.  He warned her that he knew she
had tried to steal his master's treasure, and that he had caught her in
the act.  But if she would be his, he would share the treasure with her,
and they could live in luxury in the African forests.  But if she
refused, he would tell his master, who would flog and torture her and
then give her to the police, who would kill her.




CHAPTER XIV--BATTLE RENEWED


The consequences of that meeting in the dusk of Diana's Grove were acute
and far-reaching, and not only to the two engaged in it.  From Oolanga,
this might have been expected by anyone who knew the character of the
tropical African savage.  To such, there are two passions that are
inexhaustible and insatiable--vanity and that which they are pleased to
call love.  Oolanga left the Grove with an absorbing hatred in his heart.
His lust and greed were afire, while his vanity had been wounded to the
core.  Lady Arabella's icy nature was not so deeply stirred, though she
was in a seething passion.  More than ever she was set upon bringing
Edgar Caswall to her feet.  The obstacles she had encountered, the
insults she had endured, were only as fuel to the purpose of revenge
which consumed her.

As she sought her own rooms in Diana's Grove, she went over the whole
subject again and again, always finding in the face of Lilla Watford a
key to a problem which puzzled her--the problem of a way to turn
Caswall's powers--his very existence--to aid her purpose.

When in her boudoir, she wrote a note, taking so much trouble over it
that she destroyed, and rewrote, till her dainty waste-basket was half-
full of torn sheets of notepaper.  When quite satisfied, she copied out
the last sheet afresh, and then carefully burned all the spoiled
fragments.  She put the copied note in an emblazoned envelope, and
directed it to Edgar Caswall at Castra Regis.  This she sent off by one
of her grooms.  The letter ran:

   "DEAR MR. CASWALL,

   "I want to have a chat with you on a subject in which I believe you
   are interested.  Will you kindly call for me one day after lunch--say
   at three or four o'clock, and we can walk a little way together.  Only
   as far as Mercy Farm, where I want to see Lilla and Mimi Watford.  We
   can take a cup of tea at the Farm.  Do not bring your African servant
   with you, as I am afraid his face frightens the girls.  After all, he
   is not pretty, is he?  I have an idea you will be pleased with your
   visit this time.

   "Yours sincerely,

   "ARABELLA MARCH."

At half-past three next day, Edgar Caswall called at Diana's Grove.  Lady
Arabella met him on the roadway outside the gate.  She wished to take the
servants into her confidence as little as possible.  She turned when she
saw him coming, and walked beside him towards Mercy Farm, keeping step
with him as they walked.  When they got near Mercy, she turned and looked
around her, expecting to see Oolanga or some sign of him.  He was,
however, not visible.  He had received from his master peremptory orders
to keep out of sight--an order for which the African scored a new offence
up against her.  They found Lilla and Mimi at home and seemingly glad to
see them, though both the girls were surprised at the visit coming so
soon after the other.

The proceedings were a repetition of the battle of souls of the former
visit.  On this occasion, however, Edgar Caswall had only the presence of
Lady Arabella to support him--Oolanga being absent; but Mimi lacked the
support of Adam Salton, which had been of such effective service before.
This time the struggle for supremacy of will was longer and more
determined.  Caswall felt that if he could not achieve supremacy he had
better give up the idea, so all his pride was enlisted against Mimi.  When
they had been waiting for the door to be opened, Lady Arabella, believing
in a sudden attack, had said to him in a low voice, which somehow carried
conviction:

"This time you should win.  Mimi is, after all, only a woman.  Show her
no mercy.  That is weakness.  Fight her, beat her, trample on her--kill
her if need be.  She stands in your way, and I hate her.  Never take your
eyes off her.  Never mind Lilla--she is afraid of you.  You are already
her master.  Mimi will try to make you look at her cousin.  There lies
defeat.  Let nothing take your attention from Mimi, and you will win.  If
she is overcoming you, take my hand and hold it hard whilst you are
looking into her eyes.  If she is too strong for you, I shall interfere.
I'll make a diversion, and under cover of it you must retire unbeaten,
even if not victorious.  Hush! they are coming."

The two girls came to the door together.  Strange sounds were coming up
over the Brow from the west.  It was the rustling and crackling of the
dry reeds and rushes from the low lands.  The season had been an
unusually dry one.  Also the strong east wind was helping forward
enormous flocks of birds, most of them pigeons with white cowls.  Not
only were their wings whirring, but their cooing was plainly audible.
From such a multitude of birds the mass of sound, individually small,
assumed the volume of a storm.  Surprised at the influx of birds, to
which they had been strangers so long, they all looked towards Castra
Regis, from whose high tower the great kite had been flying as usual.  But
even as they looked, the cord broke, and the great kite fell headlong in
a series of sweeping dives.  Its own weight, and the aerial force opposed
to it, which caused it to rise, combined with the strong easterly breeze,
had been too much for the great length of cord holding it.

Somehow, the mishap to the kite gave new hope to Mimi.  It was as though
the side issues had been shorn away, so that the main struggle was
thenceforth on simpler lines.  She had a feeling in her heart, as though
some religious chord had been newly touched.  It may, of course, have
been that with the renewal of the bird voices a fresh courage, a fresh
belief in the good issue of the struggle came too.  In the misery of
silence, from which they had all suffered for so long, any new train of
thought was almost bound to be a boon.  As the inrush of birds continued,
their wings beating against the crackling rushes, Lady Arabella grew
pale, and almost fainted.

"What is that?" she asked suddenly.

To Mimi, born and bred in Siam, the sound was strangely like an
exaggeration of the sound produced by a snake-charmer.

Edgar Caswall was the first to recover from the interruption of the
falling kite.  After a few minutes he seemed to have quite recovered his
_sang froid_, and was able to use his brains to the end which he had in
view.  Mimi too quickly recovered herself, but from a different cause.
With her it was a deep religious conviction that the struggle round her
was of the powers of Good and Evil, and that Good was triumphing.  The
very appearance of the snowy birds, with the cowls of Saint Columba,
heightened the impression.  With this conviction strong upon her, she
continued the strange battle with fresh vigour.  She seemed to tower over
Caswall, and he to give back before her oncoming.  Once again her
vigorous passes drove him to the door.  He was just going out backward
when Lady Arabella, who had been gazing at him with fixed eyes, caught
his hand and tried to stop his movement.  She was, however, unable to do
any good, and so, holding hands, they passed out together.  As they did
so, the strange music which had so alarmed Lady Arabella suddenly
stopped.  Instinctively they all looked towards the tower of Castra
Regis, and saw that the workmen had refixed the kite, which had risen
again and was beginning to float out to its former station.

As they were looking, the door opened and Michael Watford came into the
room.  By that time all had recovered their self-possession, and there
was nothing out of the common to attract his attention.  As he came in,
seeing inquiring looks all around him, he said:

"The new influx of birds is only the annual migration of pigeons from
Africa.  I am told that it will soon be over."

The second victory of Mimi Watford made Edgar Caswall more moody than
ever.  He felt thrown back on himself, and this, added to his absorbing
interest in the hope of a victory of his mesmeric powers, became a deep
and settled purpose of revenge.  The chief object of his animosity was,
of course, Mimi, whose will had overcome his, but it was obscured in
greater or lesser degree by all who had opposed him.  Lilla was next to
Mimi in his hate--Lilla, the harmless, tender-hearted, sweet-natured
girl, whose heart was so full of love for all things that in it was no
room for the passions of ordinary life--whose nature resembled those
doves of St. Columba, whose colour she wore, whose appearance she
reflected.  Adam Salton came next--after a gap; for against him Caswall
had no direct animosity.  He regarded him as an interference, a
difficulty to be got rid of or destroyed.  The young Australian had been
so discreet that the most he had against him was his knowledge of what
had been.  Caswall did not understand him, and to such a nature as his,
ignorance was a cause of alarm, of dread.

Caswall resumed his habit of watching the great kite straining at its
cord, varying his vigils in this way by a further examination of the
mysterious treasures of his house, especially Mesmer's chest.  He sat
much on the roof of the tower, brooding over his thwarted passion.  The
vast extent of his possessions, visible to him at that altitude, might,
one would have thought, have restored some of his complacency.  But the
very extent of his ownership, thus perpetually brought before him,
created a fresh sense of grievance.  How was it, he thought, that with so
much at command that others wished for, he could not achieve the dearest
wishes of his heart?

In this state of intellectual and moral depravity, he found a solace in
the renewal of his experiments with the mechanical powers of the kite.
For a couple of weeks he did not see Lady Arabella, who was always on the
watch for a chance of meeting him; neither did he see the Watford girls,
who studiously kept out of his way.  Adam Salton simply marked time,
keeping ready to deal with anything that might affect his friends.  He
called at the farm and heard from Mimi of the last battle of wills, but
it had only one consequence.  He got from Ross several more mongooses,
including a second king-cobra-killer, which he generally carried with him
in its box whenever he walked out.

Mr. Caswall's experiments with the kite went on successfully.  Each day
he tried the lifting of greater weight, and it seemed almost as if the
machine had a sentience of its own, which was increasing with the
obstacles placed before it.  All this time the kite hung in the sky at an
enormous height.  The wind was steadily from the north, so the trend of
the kite was to the south.  All day long, runners of increasing magnitude
were sent up.  These were only of paper or thin cardboard, or leather, or
other flexible materials.  The great height at which the kite hung made a
great concave curve in the string, so that as the runners went up they
made a flapping sound.  If one laid a finger on the string, the sound
answered to the flapping of the runner in a sort of hollow intermittent
murmur.  Edgar Caswall, who was now wholly obsessed by the kite and all
belonging to it, found a distinct resemblance between that intermittent
rumble and the snake-charming music produced by the pigeons flying
through the dry reeds.

One day he made a discovery in Mesmer's chest which he thought he would
utilise with regard to the runners.  This was a great length of wire,
"fine as human hair," coiled round a finely made wheel, which ran to a
wondrous distance freely, and as lightly.  He tried this on runners, and
found it work admirably.  Whether the runner was alone, or carried
something much more weighty than itself, it worked equally well.  Also it
was strong enough and light enough to draw back the runner without undue
strain.  He tried this a good many times successfully, but it was now
growing dusk and he found some difficulty in keeping the runner in sight.
So he looked for something heavy enough to keep it still.  He placed the
Egyptian image of Bes on the fine wire, which crossed the wooden ledge
which protected it.  Then, the darkness growing, he went indoors and
forgot all about it.

He had a strange feeling of uneasiness that night--not sleeplessness, for
he seemed conscious of being asleep.  At daylight he rose, and as usual
looked out for the kite.  He did not see it in its usual position in the
sky, so looked round the points of the compass.  He was more than
astonished when presently he saw the missing kite struggling as usual
against the controlling cord.  But it had gone to the further side of the
tower, and now hung and strained _against the wind_ to the north.  He
thought it so strange that he determined to investigate the phenomenon,
and to say nothing about it in the meantime.

In his many travels, Edgar Caswall had been accustomed to use the
sextant, and was now an expert in the matter.  By the aid of this and
other instruments, he was able to fix the position of the kite and the
point over which it hung.  He was startled to find that exactly under
it--so far as he could ascertain--was Diana's Grove.  He had an
inclination to take Lady Arabella into his confidence in the matter, but
he thought better of it and wisely refrained.  For some reason which he
did not try to explain to himself, he was glad of his silence, when, on
the following morning, he found, on looking out, that the point over
which the kite then hovered was Mercy Farm.  When he had verified this
with his instruments, he sat before the window of the tower, looking out
and thinking.  The new locality was more to his liking than the other;
but the why of it puzzled him, all the same.  He spent the rest of the
day in the turret-room, which he did not leave all day.  It seemed to him
that he was now drawn by forces which he could not control--of which,
indeed, he had no knowledge--in directions which he did not understand,
and which were without his own volition.  In sheer helpless inability to
think the problem out satisfactorily, he called up a servant and told him
to tell Oolanga that he wanted to see him at once in the turret-room.  The
answer came back that the African had not been seen since the previous
evening.

Caswall was now so irritable that even this small thing upset him.  As he
was distrait and wanted to talk to somebody, he sent for Simon Chester,
who came at once, breathless with hurrying and upset by the unexpected
summons.  Caswall bade him sit down, and when the old man was in a less
uneasy frame of mind, he again asked him if he had ever seen what was in
Mesmer's chest or heard it spoken about.

Chester admitted that he had once, in the time of "the then Mr. Edgar,"
seen the chest open, which, knowing something of its history and guessing
more, so upset him that he had fainted.  When he recovered, the chest was
closed.  From that time the then Mr. Edgar had never spoken about it
again.

When Caswall asked him to describe what he had seen when the chest was
open, he got very agitated, and, despite all his efforts to remain calm,
he suddenly went off into a faint.  Caswall summoned servants, who
applied the usual remedies.  Still the old man did not recover.  After
the lapse of a considerable time, the doctor who had been summoned made
his appearance.  A glance was sufficient for him to make up his mind.
Still, he knelt down by the old man, and made a careful examination.  Then
he rose to his feet, and in a hushed voice said:

"I grieve to say, sir, that he has passed away."




CHAPTER XV--ON THE TRACK


Those who had seen Edgar Caswall familiarly since his arrival, and had
already estimated his cold-blooded nature at something of its true value,
were surprised that he took so to heart the death of old Chester.  The
fact was that not one of them had guessed correctly at his character.
They thought, naturally enough, that the concern which he felt was that
of a master for a faithful old servant of his family.  They little
thought that it was merely the selfish expression of his disappointment,
that he had thus lost the only remaining clue to an interesting piece of
family history--one which was now and would be for ever wrapped in
mystery.  Caswall knew enough about the life of his ancestor in Paris to
wish to know more fully and more thoroughly all that had been.  The
period covered by that ancestor's life in Paris was one inviting every
form of curiosity.

Lady Arabella, who had her own game to play, saw in the _metier_ of
sympathetic friend, a series of meetings with the man she wanted to
secure.  She made the first use of the opportunity the day after old
Chester's death; indeed, as soon as the news had filtered in through the
back door of Diana's Grove.  At that meeting, she played her part so well
that even Caswall's cold nature was impressed.

Oolanga was the only one who did not credit her with at least some sense
of fine feeling in the matter.  In emotional, as in other matters,
Oolanga was distinctly a utilitarian, and as he could not understand
anyone feeling grief except for his own suffering, pain, or for the loss
of money, he could not understand anyone simulating such an emotion
except for show intended to deceive.  He thought that she had come to
Castra Regis again for the opportunity of stealing something, and was
determined that on this occasion the chance of pressing his advantage
over her should not pass.  He felt, therefore, that the occasion was one
for extra carefulness in the watching of all that went on.  Ever since he
had come to the conclusion that Lady Arabella was trying to steal the
treasure-chest, he suspected nearly everyone of the same design, and made
it a point to watch all suspicious persons and places.  As Adam was
engaged on his own researches regarding Lady Arabella, it was only
natural that there should be some crossing of each other's tracks.  This
is what did actually happen.

Adam had gone for an early morning survey of the place in which he was
interested, taking with him the mongoose in its box.  He arrived at the
gate of Diana's Grove just as Lady Arabella was preparing to set out for
Castra Regis on what she considered her mission of comfort.  Seeing Adam
from her window going through the shadows of the trees round the gate,
she thought that he must be engaged on some purpose similar to her own.
So, quickly making her toilet, she quietly left the house, and, taking
advantage of every shadow and substance which could hide her, followed
him on his walk.

Oolanga, the experienced tracker, followed her, but succeeded in hiding
his movements better than she did.  He saw that Adam had on his shoulder
a mysterious box, which he took to contain something valuable.  Seeing
that Lady Arabella was secretly following Adam, he was confirmed in this
idea.  His mind--such as it was--was fixed on her trying to steal, and he
credited her at once with making use of this new opportunity.

In his walk, Adam went into the grounds of Castra Regis, and Oolanga saw
her follow him with great secrecy.  He feared to go closer, as now on
both sides of him were enemies who might make discovery.  When he
realised that Lady Arabella was bound for the Castle, he devoted himself
to following her with singleness of purpose.  He therefore missed seeing
that Adam branched off the track and returned to the high road.

That night Edgar Caswall had slept badly.  The tragic occurrence of the
day was on his mind, and he kept waking and thinking of it.  After an
early breakfast, he sat at the open window watching the kite and thinking
of many things.  From his room he could see all round the neighbourhood,
but the two places that interested him most were Mercy Farm and Diana's
Grove.  At first the movements about those spots were of a humble
kind--those that belong to domestic service or agricultural needs--the
opening of doors and windows, the sweeping and brushing, and generally
the restoration of habitual order.

From his high window--whose height made it a screen from the observation
of others--he saw the chain of watchers move into his own grounds, and
then presently break up--Adam Salton going one way, and Lady Arabella,
followed by the nigger, another.  Then Oolanga disappeared amongst the
trees; but Caswall could see that he was still watching.  Lady Arabella,
after looking around her, slipped in by the open door, and he could, of
course, see her no longer.

Presently, however, he heard a light tap at his door, then the door
opened slowly, and he could see the flash of Lady Arabella's white dress
through the opening.




CHAPTER XVI--A VISIT OF SYMPATHY


Caswall was genuinely surprised when he saw Lady Arabella, though he need
not have been, after what had already occurred in the same way.  The look
of surprise on his face was so much greater than Lady Arabella had
expected--though she thought she was prepared to meet anything that might
occur--that she stood still, in sheer amazement.  Cold-blooded as she was
and ready for all social emergencies, she was nonplussed how to go on.
She was plucky, however, and began to speak at once, although she had not
the slightest idea what she was going to say.

"I came to offer you my very warm sympathy with the grief you have so
lately experienced."

"My grief?  I'm afraid I must be very dull; but I really do not
understand."

Already she felt at a disadvantage, and hesitated.

"I mean about the old man who died so suddenly--your old . . . retainer."

Caswall's face relaxed something of its puzzled concentration.

"Oh, he was only a servant; and he had over-stayed his three-score and
ten years by something like twenty years.  He must have been ninety!"

"Still, as an old servant . . . "

Caswall's words were not so cold as their inflection.

"I never interfere with servants.  He was kept on here merely because he
had been so long on the premises.  I suppose the steward thought it might
make him unpopular if the old fellow had been dismissed."

How on earth was she to proceed on such a task as hers if this was the
utmost geniality she could expect?  So she at once tried another
tack--this time a personal one.

"I am sorry I disturbed you.  I am really not unconventional--though
certainly no slave to convention.  Still there are limits . . . it is bad
enough to intrude in this way, and I do not know what you can say or
think of the time selected, for the intrusion."

After all, Edgar Caswall was a gentleman by custom and habit, so he rose
to the occasion.

"I can only say, Lady Arabella, that you are always welcome at any time
you may deign to honour my house with your presence."

She smiled at him sweetly.

"Thank you _so_ much.  You _do_ put one at ease.  My breach of convention
makes me glad rather than sorry.  I feel that I can open my heart to you
about anything."

Forthwith she proceeded to tell him about Oolanga and his strange
suspicions of her honesty.  Caswall laughed and made her explain all the
details.  His final comment was enlightening.

"Let me give you a word of advice: If you have the slightest fault to
find with that infernal nigger, shoot him at sight.  A swelled-headed
nigger, with a bee in his bonnet, is one of the worst difficulties in the
world to deal with.  So better make a clean job of it, and wipe him out
at once!"

"But what about the law, Mr. Caswall?"

"Oh, the law doesn't concern itself much about dead niggers.  A few more
or less do not matter.  To my mind it's rather a relief!"

"I'm afraid of you," was her only comment, made with a sweet smile and in
a soft voice.

"All right," he said, "let us leave it at that.  Anyhow, we shall be rid
of one of them!"

"I don't love niggers any more than you do," she replied, "and I suppose
one mustn't be too particular where that sort of cleaning up is
concerned."  Then she changed in voice and manner, and asked genially:
"And now tell me, am I forgiven?"

"You are, dear lady--if there is anything to forgive."

As he spoke, seeing that she had moved to go, he came to the door with
her, and in the most natural way accompanied her downstairs.  He passed
through the hall with her and down the avenue.  As he went back to the
house, she smiled to herself.

"Well, that is all right.  I don't think the morning has been altogether
thrown away."

And she walked slowly back to Diana's Grove.

Adam Salton followed the line of the Brow, and refreshed his memory as to
the various localities.  He got home to Lesser Hill just as Sir Nathaniel
was beginning lunch.  Mr. Salton had gone to Walsall to keep an early
appointment; so he was all alone.  When the meal was over--seeing in
Adam's face that he had something to speak about--he followed into the
study and shut the door.

When the two men had lighted their pipes, Sir Nathaniel began.

"I have remembered an interesting fact about Diana's Grove--there is, I
have long understood, some strange mystery about that house.  It may be
of some interest, or it may be trivial, in such a tangled skein as we are
trying to unravel."

"Please tell me all you know or suspect.  To begin, then, of what sort
is the mystery--physical, mental, moral, historical, scientific, occult?
Any kind of hint will help me."

"Quite right.  I shall try to tell you what I think; but I have not put
my thoughts on the subject in sequence, so you must forgive me if due
order is not observed in my narration.  I suppose you have seen the house
at Diana's Grove?"

"The outside of it; but I have that in my mind's eye, and I can fit into
my memory whatever you may mention."

"The house is very old--probably the first house of some sort that stood
there was in the time of the Romans.  This was probably renewed--perhaps
several times at later periods.  The house stands, or, rather, used to
stand here when Mercia was a kingdom--I do not suppose that the basement
can be later than the Norman Conquest.  Some years ago, when I was
President of the Mercian Archaeological Society, I went all over it very
carefully.  This was when it was purchased by Captain March.  The house
had then been done up, so as to be suitable for the bride.  The basement
is very strong,--almost as strong and as heavy as if it had been intended
as a fortress.  There are a whole series of rooms deep underground.  One
of them in particular struck me.  The room itself is of considerable
size, but the masonry is more than massive.  In the middle of the room is
a sunk well, built up to floor level and evidently going deep
underground.  There is no windlass nor any trace of there ever having
been any--no rope--nothing.  Now, we know that the Romans had wells of
immense depth, from which the water was lifted by the 'old rag rope';
that at Woodhull used to be nearly a thousand feet.  Here, then, we have
simply an enormously deep well-hole.  The door of the room was massive,
and was fastened with a lock nearly a foot square.  It was evidently
intended for some kind of protection to someone or something; but no one
in those days had ever heard of anyone having been allowed even to see
the room.  All this is _a propos_ of a suggestion on my part that the
well-hole was a way by which the White Worm (whatever it was) went and
came.  At that time I would have had a search made--even excavation if
necessary--at my own expense, but all suggestions were met with a prompt
and explicit negative.  So, of course, I took no further step in the
matter.  Then it died out of recollection--even of mine."

"Do you remember, sir," asked Adam, "what was the appearance of the room
where the well-hole was?  Was there furniture--in fact, any sort of thing
in the room?"

"The only thing I remember was a sort of green light--very clouded, very
dim--which came up from the well.  Not a fixed light, but intermittent
and irregular--quite unlike anything I had ever seen."

"Do you remember how you got into the well-room?  Was there a separate
door from outside, or was there any interior room or passage which opened
into it?"

"I think there must have been some room with a way into it.  I remember
going up some steep steps; they must have been worn smooth by long use or
something of the kind, for I could hardly keep my feet as I went up.  Once
I stumbled and nearly fell into the well-hole."

"Was there anything strange about the place--any queer smell, for
instance?"

"Queer smell--yes!  Like bilge or a rank swamp.  It was distinctly
nauseating; when I came out I felt as if I had just been going to be
sick.  I shall try back on my visit and see if I can recall any more of
what I saw or felt."

"Then perhaps, sir, later in the day you will tell me anything you may
chance to recollect."

"I shall be delighted, Adam.  If your uncle has not returned by then,
I'll join you in the study after dinner, and we can resume this
interesting chat."




CHAPTER XVII--THE MYSTERY OF "THE GROVE"


That afternoon Adam decided to do a little exploring.  As he passed
through the wood outside the gate of Diana's Grove, he thought he saw the
African's face for an instant.  So he went deeper into the undergrowth,
and followed along parallel to the avenue to the house.  He was glad that
there was no workman or servant about, for he did not care that any of
Lady Arabella's people should find him wandering about her grounds.
Taking advantage of the denseness of the trees, he came close to the
house and skirted round it.  He was repaid for his trouble, for on the
far side of the house, close to where the rocky frontage of the cliff
fell away, he saw Oolanga crouched behind the irregular trunk of a great
oak.  The man was so intent on watching someone, or something, that he
did not guard against being himself watched.  This suited Adam, for he
could thus make scrutiny at will.

The thick wood, though the trees were mostly of small girth, threw a
heavy shadow, so that the steep declension, in front of which grew the
tree behind which the African lurked, was almost in darkness.  Adam drew
as close as he could, and was amazed to see a patch of light on the
ground before him; when he realised what it was, he was determined, more
than ever to follow on his quest.  The nigger had a dark lantern in his
hand, and was throwing the light down the steep incline.  The glare
showed a series of stone steps, which ended in a low-lying heavy iron
door fixed against the side of the house.  All the strange things he had
heard from Sir Nathaniel, and all those, little and big, which he had
himself noticed, crowded into his mind in a chaotic way.  Instinctively
he took refuge behind a thick oak stem, and set himself down, to watch
what might occur.

After a short time it became apparent that the African was trying to find
out what was behind the heavy door.  There was no way of looking in, for
the door fitted tight into the massive stone slabs.  The only opportunity
for the entrance of light was through a small hole between the great
stones above the door.  This hole was too high up to look through from
the ground level.  Oolanga, having tried standing tiptoe on the highest
point near, and holding the lantern as high as he could, threw the light
round the edges of the door to see if he could find anywhere a hole or a
flaw in the metal through which he could obtain a glimpse.  Foiled in
this, he brought from the shrubbery a plank, which he leant against the
top of the door and then climbed up with great dexterity.  This did not
bring him near enough to the window-hole to look in, or even to throw the
light of the lantern through it, so he climbed down and carried the plank
back to the place from which he had got it.  Then he concealed himself
near the iron door and waited, manifestly with the intent of remaining
there till someone came near.  Presently Lady Arabella, moving
noiselessly through the shade, approached the door.  When he saw her
close enough to touch it, Oolanga stepped forward from his concealment,
and spoke in a whisper, which through the gloom sounded like a hiss.

"I want to see you, missy--soon and secret."

"What do you want?"

"You know well, missy; I told you already."

She turned on him with blazing eyes, the green tint in them glowing like
emeralds.

"Come, none of that.  If there is anything sensible which you wish to say
to me, you can see me here, just where we are, at seven o'clock."

He made no reply in words, but, putting the backs of his hands together,
bent lower and lower till his forehead touched the earth.  Then he rose
and went slowly away.

Adam Salton, from his hiding-place, saw and wondered.  In a few minutes
he moved from his place and went home to Lesser Hill, fully determined
that seven o'clock would find him in some hidden place behind Diana's
Grove.

At a little before seven Adam stole softly out of the house and took the
back-way to the rear of Diana's Grove.  The place seemed silent and
deserted, so he took the opportunity of concealing himself near the spot
whence he had seen Oolanga trying to investigate whatever was concealed
behind the iron door.  He waited, perfectly still, and at last saw a
gleam of white passing soundlessly through the undergrowth.  He was not
surprised when he recognised the colour of Lady Arabella's dress.  She
came close and waited, with her face to the iron door.  From some place
of concealment near at hand Oolanga appeared, and came close to her.  Adam
noticed, with surprised amusement, that over his shoulder was the box
with the mongoose.  Of course the African did not know that he was seen
by anyone, least of all by the man whose property he had with him.

Silent-footed as he was, Lady Arabella heard him coming, and turned to
meet him.  It was somewhat hard to see in the gloom, for, as usual, he
was all in black, only his collar and cuffs showing white.  Lady Arabella
opened the conversation which ensued between the two.

"What do you want?  To rob me, or murder me?"

"No, to lub you!"

This frightened her a little, and she tried to change the tone.

"Is that a coffin you have with you?  If so, you are wasting your time.
It would not hold me."

When a nigger suspects he is being laughed at, all the ferocity of his
nature comes to the front; and this man was of the lowest kind.

"Dis ain't no coffin for nobody.  Dis box is for you.  Somefin you lub.
Me give him to you!"

Still anxious to keep off the subject of affection, on which she believed
him to have become crazed, she made another effort to keep his mind
elsewhere.

"Is this why you want to see me?"  He nodded.  "Then come round to the
other door.  But be quiet.  I have no desire to be seen so close to my
own house in conversation with a--a--a nigger like you!"

She had chosen the word deliberately.  She wished to meet his passion
with another kind.  Such would, at all events, help to keep him quiet.  In
the deep gloom she could not see the anger which suffused his face.
Rolling eyeballs and grinding teeth are, however, sufficient signs of
anger to be decipherable in the dark.  She moved round the corner of the
house to her right.  Oolanga was following her, when she stopped him by
raising her hand.

"No, not that door," she said; "that is not for niggers.  The other door
will do well enough for you!"

Lady Arabella took in her hand a small key which hung at the end of her
watch-chain, and moved to a small door, low down, round the corner, and a
little downhill from the edge of the Brow.  Oolanga, in obedience to her
gesture, went back to the iron door.  Adam looked carefully at the
mongoose box as the African went by, and was glad to see that it was
intact.  Unconsciously, as he looked, he fingered the key that was in his
waistcoat pocket.  When Oolanga was out of sight, Adam hurried after Lady
Arabella.




CHAPTER XVIII--EXIT OOLANGA


The woman turned sharply as Adam touched her shoulder.

"One moment whilst we are alone.  You had better not trust that nigger!"
he whispered.

Her answer was crisp and concise:

"I don't."

"Forewarned is forearmed.  Tell me if you will--it is for your own
protection.  Why do you mistrust him?"

"My friend, you have no idea of that man's impudence.  Would you believe
that he wants me to marry him?"

"No!" said Adam incredulously, amused in spite of himself.

"Yes, and wanted to bribe me to do it by sharing a chest of treasure--at
least, he thought it was--stolen from Mr. Caswall.  Why do you distrust
him, Mr. Salton?"

"Did you notice that box he had slung on his shoulder?  That belongs to
me.  I left it in the gun-room when I went to lunch.  He must have crept
in and stolen it.  Doubtless he thinks that it, too, is full of
treasure."

"He does!"

"How on earth do you know?" asked Adam.

"A little while ago he offered to give it to me--another bribe to accept
him.  Faugh!  I am ashamed to tell you such a thing.  The beast!"

Whilst they had been speaking, she had opened the door, a narrow iron
one, well hung, for it opened easily and closed tightly without any
creaking or sound of any kind.  Within all was dark; but she entered as
freely and with as little misgiving or restraint as if it had been broad
daylight.  For Adam, there was just sufficient green light from somewhere
for him to see that there was a broad flight of heavy stone steps leading
upward; but Lady Arabella, after shutting the door behind her, when it
closed tightly without a clang, tripped up the steps lightly and swiftly.
For an instant all was dark, but there came again the faint green light
which enabled him to see the outlines of things.  Another iron door,
narrow like the first and fairly high, led into another large room, the
walls of which were of massive stones, so closely joined together as to
exhibit only one smooth surface.  This presented the appearance of having
at one time been polished.  On the far side, also smooth like the walls,
was the reverse of a wide, but not high, iron door.  Here there was a
little more light, for the high-up aperture over the door opened to the
air.

Lady Arabella took from her girdle another small key, which she inserted
in a keyhole in the centre of a massive lock.  The great bolt seemed
wonderfully hung, for the moment the small key was turned, the bolts of
the great lock moved noiselessly and the iron doors swung open.  On the
stone steps outside stood Oolanga, with the mongoose box slung over his
shoulder.  Lady Arabella stood a little on one side, and the African,
accepting the movement as an invitation, entered in an obsequious way.
The moment, however, that he was inside, he gave a quick look around him.

"Much death here--big death.  Many deaths.  Good, good!"

He sniffed round as if he was enjoying the scent.  The matter and manner
of his speech were so revolting that instinctively Adam's hand wandered
to his revolver, and, with his finger on the trigger, he rested satisfied
that he was ready for any emergency.

There was certainly opportunity for the nigger's enjoyment, for the open
well-hole was almost under his nose, sending up such a stench as almost
made Adam sick, though Lady Arabella seemed not to mind it at all.  It
was like nothing that Adam had ever met with.  He compared it with all
the noxious experiences he had ever had--the drainage of war hospitals,
of slaughter-houses, the refuse of dissecting rooms.  None of these was
like it, though it had something of them all, with, added, the sourness
of chemical waste and the poisonous effluvium of the bilge of a water-
logged ship whereon a multitude of rats had been drowned.

Then, quite unexpectedly, the negro noticed the presence of a third
person--Adam Salton!  He pulled out a pistol and shot at him, happily
missing.  Adam was himself usually a quick shot, but this time his mind
had been on something else and he was not ready.  However, he was quick
to carry out an intention, and he was not a coward.  In another moment
both men were in grips.  Beside them was the dark well-hole, with that
horrid effluvium stealing up from its mysterious depths.

Adam and Oolanga both had pistols; Lady Arabella, who had not one, was
probably the most ready of them all in the theory of shooting, but that
being impossible, she made her effort in another way.  Gliding forward,
she tried to seize the African; but he eluded her grasp, just missing, in
doing so, falling into the mysterious hole.  As he swayed back to firm
foothold, he turned his own gun on her and shot.  Instinctively Adam
leaped at his assailant; clutching at each other, they tottered on the
very brink.

Lady Arabella's anger, now fully awake, was all for Oolanga.  She moved
towards him with her hands extended, and had just seized him when the
catch of the locked box--due to some movement from within--flew open, and
the king-cobra-killer flew at her with a venomous fury impossible to
describe.  As it seized her throat, she caught hold of it, and, with a
fury superior to its own, tore it in two just as if it had been a sheet
of paper.  The strength used for such an act must have been terrific.  In
an instant, it seemed to spout blood and entrails, and was hurled into
the well-hole.  In another instant she had seized Oolanga, and with a
swift rush had drawn him, her white arms encircling him, down with her
into the gaping aperture.

Adam saw a medley of green and red lights blaze in a whirling circle, and
as it sank down into the well, a pair of blazing green eyes became fixed,
sank lower and lower with frightful rapidity, and disappeared, throwing
upward the green light which grew more and more vivid every moment.  As
the light sank into the noisome depths, there came a shriek which chilled
Adam's blood--a prolonged agony of pain and terror which seemed to have
no end.

Adam Salton felt that he would never be able to free his mind from the
memory of those dreadful moments.  The gloom which surrounded that
horrible charnel pit, which seemed to go down to the very bowels of the
earth, conveyed from far down the sights and sounds of the nethermost
hell.  The ghastly fate of the African as he sank down to his terrible
doom, his black face growing grey with terror, his white eyeballs, now
like veined bloodstone, rolling in the helpless extremity of fear.  The
mysterious green light was in itself a milieu of horror.  And through it
all the awful cry came up from that fathomless pit, whose entrance was
flooded with spots of fresh blood.  Even the death of the fearless little
snake-killer--so fierce, so frightful, as if stained with a ferocity
which told of no living force above earth, but only of the devils of the
pit--was only an incident.  Adam was in a state of intellectual tumult,
which had no parallel in his experience.  He tried to rush away from the
horrible place; even the baleful green light, thrown up through the
gloomy well-shaft, was dying away as its source sank deeper into the
primeval ooze.  The darkness was closing in on him in overwhelming
density--darkness in such a place and with such a memory of it!

He made a wild rush forward--slipt on the steps in some sticky, acrid-
smelling mass that felt and smelt like blood, and, falling forward, felt
his way into the inner room, where the well-shaft was not.

Then he rubbed his eyes in sheer amazement.  Up the stone steps from the
narrow door by which he had entered, glided the white-clad figure of Lady
Arabella, the only colour to be seen on her being blood-marks on her face
and hands and throat.  Otherwise, she was calm and unruffled, as when
earlier she stood aside for him to pass in through the narrow iron door.




CHAPTER XIX--AN ENEMY IN THE DARK


Adam Salton went for a walk before returning to Lesser Hill; he felt that
it might be well, not only to steady his nerves, shaken by the horrible
scene, but to get his thoughts into some sort of order, so as to be ready
to enter on the matter with Sir Nathaniel.  He was a little embarrassed
as to telling his uncle, for affairs had so vastly progressed beyond his
original view that he felt a little doubtful as to what would be the old
gentleman's attitude when he should hear of the strange events for the
first time.  Mr. Salton would certainly not be satisfied at being treated
as an outsider with regard to such things, most of which had points of
contact with the inmates of his own house.  It was with an immense sense
of relief that Adam heard that his uncle had telegraphed to the
housekeeper that he was detained by business at Walsall, where he would
remain for the night; and that he would be back in the morning in time
for lunch.

When Adam got home after his walk, he found Sir Nathaniel just going to
bed.  He did not say anything to him then of what had happened, but
contented himself with arranging that they would walk together in the
early morning, as he had much to say that would require serious
attention.

Strangely enough he slept well, and awoke at dawn with his mind clear and
his nerves in their usual unshaken condition.  The maid brought up, with
his early morning cup of tea, a note which had been found in the letter-
box.  It was from Lady Arabella, and was evidently intended to put him on
his guard as to what he should say about the previous evening.

He read it over carefully several times, before he was satisfied that he
had taken in its full import.

   "DEAR MR. SALTON,

   "I cannot go to bed until I have written to you, so you must forgive
   me if I disturb you, and at an unseemly time.  Indeed, you must also
   forgive me if, in trying to do what is right, I err in saying too much
   or too little.  The fact is that I am quite upset and unnerved by all
   that has happened in this terrible night.  I find it difficult even to
   write; my hands shake so that they are not under control, and I am
   trembling all over with memory of the horrors we saw enacted before
   our eyes.  I am grieved beyond measure that I should be, however
   remotely, a cause of this horror coming on you.  Forgive me if you
   can, and do not think too hardly of me.  This I ask with confidence,
   for since we shared together the danger--the very pangs--of death, I
   feel that we should be to one another something more than mere
   friends, that I may lean on you and trust you, assured that your
   sympathy and pity are for me.  You really must let me thank you for
   the friendliness, the help, the confidence, the real aid at a time of
   deadly danger and deadly fear which you showed me.  That awful man--I
   shall see him for ever in my dreams.  His black, malignant face will
   shut out all memory of sunshine and happiness.  I shall eternally see
   his evil eyes as he threw himself into that well-hole in a vain effort
   to escape from the consequences of his own misdoing.  The more I think
   of it, the more apparent it seems to me that he had premeditated the
   whole thing--of course, except his own horrible death.

   "Perhaps you have noticed a fur collar I occasionally wear.  It is one
   of my most valued treasures--an ermine collar studded with emeralds.  I
   had often seen the nigger's eyes gleam covetously when he looked at
   it.  Unhappily, I wore it yesterday.  That may have been the cause
   that lured the poor man to his doom.  On the very brink of the abyss
   he tore the collar from my neck--that was the last I saw of him.  When
   he sank into the hole, I was rushing to the iron door, which I pulled
   behind me.  When I heard that soul-sickening yell, which marked his
   disappearance in the chasm, I was more glad than I can say that my
   eyes were spared the pain and horror which my ears had to endure.

   "When I tore myself out of the negro's grasp as he sank into the well-
   hole; I realised what freedom meant.  Freedom!  Freedom!  Not only
   from that noisome prison-house, which has now such a memory, but from
   the more noisome embrace of that hideous monster.  Whilst I live, I
   shall always thank you for my freedom.  A woman must sometimes express
   her gratitude; otherwise it becomes too great to bear.  I am not a
   sentimental girl, who merely likes to thank a man; I am a woman who
   knows all, of bad as well as good, that life can give.  I have known
   what it is to love and to lose.  But you must not let me bring any
   unhappiness into your life.  I must live on--as I have lived--alone,
   and, in addition, bear with other woes the memory of this latest
   insult and horror.  In the meantime, I must get away as quickly as
   possible from Diana's Grove.  In the morning I shall go up to town,
   where I shall remain for a week--I cannot stay longer, as business
   affairs demand my presence here.  I think, however, that a week in the
   rush of busy London, surrounded with multitudes of commonplace people,
   will help to soften--I cannot expect total obliteration--the terrible
   images of the bygone night.  When I can sleep easily--which will be, I
   hope, after a day or two--I shall be fit to return home and take up
   again the burden which will, I suppose, always be with me.

   "I shall be most happy to see you on my return--or earlier, if my good
   fortune sends you on any errand to London.  I shall stay at the
   Mayfair Hotel.  In that busy spot we may forget some of the dangers
   and horrors we have shared together.  Adieu, and thank you, again and
   again, for all your kindness and consideration to me.

   "ARABELLA MARSH."

Adam was surprised by this effusive epistle, but he determined to say
nothing of it to Sir Nathaniel until he should have thought it well over.
When Adam met Sir Nathaniel at breakfast, he was glad that he had taken
time to turn things over in his mind.  The result had been that not only
was he familiar with the facts in all their bearings, but he had already
so far differentiated them that he was able to arrange them in his own
mind according to their values.  Breakfast had been a silent function, so
it did not interfere in any way with the process of thought.

So soon as the door was closed, Sir Nathaniel began:

"I see, Adam, that something has occurred, and that you have much to tell
me."

"That is so, sir.  I suppose I had better begin by telling you all I
know--all that has happened since I left you yesterday?"

Accordingly Adam gave him details of all that had happened during the
previous evening.  He confined himself rigidly to the narration of
circumstances, taking care not to colour events by any comment of his
own, or any opinion of the meaning of things which he did not fully
understand.  At first, Sir Nathaniel seemed disposed to ask questions,
but shortly gave this up when he recognised that the narration was
concise and self-explanatory.  Thenceforth, he contented himself with
quick looks and glances, easily interpreted, or by some acquiescent
motions of his hands, when such could be convenient, to emphasise his
idea of the correctness of any inference.  Until Adam ceased speaking,
having evidently come to an end of what he had to say with regard to this
section of his story, the elder man made no comment whatever.  Even when
Adam took from his pocket Lady Arabella's letter, with the manifest
intention of reading it, he did not make any comment.  Finally, when Adam
folded up the letter and put it, in its envelope, back in his pocket, as
an intimation that he had now quite finished, the old diplomatist
carefully made a few notes in his pocket-book.

"Your narrative, my dear Adam, is altogether admirable.  I think I may
now take it that we are both well versed in the actual facts, and that
our conference had better take the shape of a mutual exchange of ideas.
Let us both ask questions as they may arise; and I do not doubt that we
shall arrive at some enlightening conclusions."

"Will you kindly begin, sir?  I do not doubt that, with your longer
experience, you will be able to dissipate some of the fog which envelops
certain of the things which we have to consider."

"I hope so, my dear boy.  For a beginning, then, let me say that Lady
Arabella's letter makes clear some things which she intended--and also
some things which she did not intend.  But, before I begin to draw
deductions, let me ask you a few questions.  Adam, are you heart-whole,
quite heart-whole, in the matter of Lady Arabella?"

His companion answered at once, each looking the other straight in the
eyes during question and answer.

"Lady Arabella, sir, is a charming woman, and I should have deemed it a
privilege to meet her--to talk to her--even--since I am in the
confessional--to flirt a little with her.  But if you mean to ask if my
affections are in any way engaged, I can emphatically answer 'No!'--as
indeed you will understand when presently I give you the reason.  Apart
from that, there are the unpleasant details we discussed the other day."

"Could you--would you mind giving me the reason now?  It will help us to
understand what is before us, in the way of difficulty."

"Certainly, sir.  My reason, on which I can fully depend, is that I love
another woman!"

"That clinches it.  May I offer my good wishes, and, I hope, my
congratulations?"

"I am proud of your good wishes, sir, and I thank you for them.  But it
is too soon for congratulations--the lady does not even know my hopes
yet.  Indeed, I hardly knew them myself, as definite, till this moment."

"I take it then, Adam, that at the right time I may be allowed to know
who the lady is?"

Adam laughed a low, sweet laugh, such as ripples from a happy heart.

"There need not be an hour's, a minute's delay.  I shall be glad to share
my secret with you, sir.  The lady, sir, whom I am so happy as to love,
and in whom my dreams of life-long happiness are centred, is Mimi
Watford!"

"Then, my dear Adam, I need not wait to offer congratulations.  She is
indeed a very charming young lady.  I do not think I ever saw a girl who
united in such perfection the qualities of strength of character and
sweetness of disposition.  With all my heart, I congratulate you.  Then I
may take it that my question as to your heart-wholeness is answered in
the affirmative?"

"Yes; and now, sir, may I ask in turn why the question?"

"Certainly!  I asked because it seems to me that we are coming to a point
where my questions might be painful to you."

"It is not merely that I love Mimi, but I have reason to look on Lady
Arabella as her enemy," Adam continued.

"Her enemy?"

"Yes.  A rank and unscrupulous enemy who is bent on her destruction."

Sir Nathaniel went to the door, looked outside it and returned, locking
it carefully behind him.




CHAPTER XX--METABOLISM


"Am I looking grave?" asked Sir Nathaniel inconsequently when he
re-entered the room.

"You certainly are, sir."

"We little thought when first we met that we should be drawn into such a
vortex.  Already we are mixed up in robbery, and probably murder, but--a
thousand times worse than all the crimes in the calendar--in an affair of
ghastly mystery which has no bottom and no end--with forces of the most
unnerving kind, which had their origin in an age when the world was
different from the world which we know.  We are going back to the origin
of superstition--to an age when dragons tore each other in their slime.
We must fear nothing--no conclusion, however improbable, almost
impossible it may be.  Life and death is hanging on our judgment, not
only for ourselves, but for others whom we love.  Remember, I count on
you as I hope you count on me."

"I do, with all confidence."

"Then," said Sir Nathaniel, "let us think justly and boldly and fear
nothing, however terrifying it may seem.  I suppose I am to take as exact
in every detail your account of all the strange things which happened
whilst you were in Diana's Grove?"

"So far as I know, yes.  Of course I may be mistaken in recollection of
some detail or another, but I am certain that in the main what I have
said is correct."

"You feel sure that you saw Lady Arabella seize the negro round the neck,
and drag him down with her into the hole?"

"Absolutely certain, sir, otherwise I should have gone to her
assistance."

"We have, then, an account of what happened from an eye-witness whom we
trust--that is yourself.  We have also another account, written by Lady
Arabella under her own hand.  These two accounts do not agree.  Therefore
we must take it that one of the two is lying."

"Apparently, sir."

"And that Lady Arabella is the liar!"

"Apparently--as I am not."

"We must, therefore, try to find a reason for her lying.  She has nothing
to fear from Oolanga, who is dead.  Therefore the only reason which could
actuate her would be to convince someone else that she was blameless.
This 'someone' could not be you, for you had the evidence of your own
eyes.  There was no one else present; therefore it must have been an
absent person."

"That seems beyond dispute, sir."

"There is only one other person whose good opinion she could wish to
keep--Edgar Caswall.  He is the only one who fills the bill.  Her lies
point to other things besides the death of the African.  She evidently
wanted it to be accepted that his falling into the well was his own act.
I cannot suppose that she expected to convince you, the eye-witness; but
if she wished later on to spread the story, it was wise of her to try to
get your acceptance of it."

"That is so!"

"Then there were other matters of untruth.  That, for instance, of the
ermine collar embroidered with emeralds.  If an understandable reason be
required for this, it would be to draw attention away from the green
lights which were seen in the room, and especially in the well-hole.  Any
unprejudiced person would accept the green lights to be the eyes of a
great snake, such as tradition pointed to living in the well-hole.  In
fine, therefore, Lady Arabella wanted the general belief to be that there
was no snake of the kind in Diana's Grove.  For my own part, I don't
believe in a partial liar--this art does not deal in veneer; a liar is a
liar right through.  Self-interest may prompt falsity of the tongue; but
if one prove to be a liar, nothing that he says can ever be believed.
This leads us to the conclusion that because she said or inferred that
there was no snake, we should look for one--and expect to find it, too.

"Now let me digress.  I live, and have for many years lived, in
Derbyshire, a county more celebrated for its caves than any other county
in England.  I have been through them all, and am familiar with every
turn of them; as also with other great caves in Kentucky, in France, in
Germany, and a host of other places--in many of these are tremendously
deep caves of narrow aperture, which are valued by intrepid explorers,
who descend narrow gullets of abysmal depth--and sometimes never return.
In many of the caverns in the Peak I am convinced that some of the
smaller passages were used in primeval times as the lairs of some of the
great serpents of legend and tradition.  It may have been that such
caverns were formed in the usual geologic way--bubbles or flaws in the
earth's crust--which were later used by the monsters of the period of the
young world.  It may have been, of course, that some of them were worn
originally by water; but in time they all found a use when suitable for
living monsters.

"This brings us to another point, more difficult to accept and understand
than any other requiring belief in a base not usually accepted, or indeed
entered on--whether such abnormal growths could have ever changed in
their nature.  Some day the study of metabolism may progress so far as to
enable us to accept structural changes proceeding from an intellectual or
moral base.  We may lean towards a belief that great animal strength may
be a sound base for changes of all sorts.  If this be so, what could be a
more fitting subject than primeval monsters whose strength was such as to
allow a survival of thousands of years?  We do not know yet if brain can
increase and develop independently of other parts of the living
structure.

"After all, the mediaeval belief in the Philosopher's Stone which could
transmute metals, has its counterpart in the accepted theory of
metabolism which changes living tissue.  In an age of investigation like
our own, when we are returning to science as the base of wonders--almost
of miracles--we should be slow to refuse to accept facts, however
impossible they may seem to be.

"Let us suppose a monster of the early days of the world--a dragon of the
prime--of vast age running into thousands of years, to whom had been
conveyed in some way--it matters not--a brain just sufficient for the
beginning of growth.  Suppose the monster to be of incalculable size and
of a strength quite abnormal--a veritable incarnation of animal strength.
Suppose this animal is allowed to remain in one place, thus being removed
from accidents of interrupted development; might not, would not this
creature, in process of time--ages, if necessary--have that rudimentary
intelligence developed?  There is no impossibility in this; it is only
the natural process of evolution.  In the beginning, the instincts of
animals are confined to alimentation, self-protection, and the
multiplication of their species.  As time goes on and the needs of life
become more complex, power follows need.  We have been long accustomed to
consider growth as applied almost exclusively to size in its various
aspects.  But Nature, who has no doctrinaire ideas, may equally apply it
to concentration.  A developing thing may expand in any given way or
form.  Now, it is a scientific law that increase implies gain and loss of
various kinds; what a thing gains in one direction it may lose in
another.  May it not be that Mother Nature may deliberately encourage
decrease as well as increase--that it may be an axiom that what is gained
in concentration is lost in size?  Take, for instance, monsters that
tradition has accepted and localised, such as the Worm of Lambton or that
of Spindleston Heugh.  If such a creature were, by its own process of
metabolism, to change much of its bulk for intellectual growth, we should
at once arrive at a new class of creature--more dangerous, perhaps, than
the world has ever had any experience of--a force which can think, which
has no soul and no morals, and therefore no acceptance of responsibility.
A snake would be a good illustration of this, for it is cold-blooded, and
therefore removed from the temptations which often weaken or restrict
warm-blooded creatures.  If, for instance, the Worm of Lambton--if such
ever existed--were guided to its own ends by an organised intelligence
capable of expansion, what form of creature could we imagine which would
equal it in potentialities of evil?  Why, such a being would devastate a
whole country.  Now, all these things require much thought, and we want
to apply the knowledge usefully, and we should therefore be exact.  Would
it not be well to resume the subject later in the day?"

"I quite agree, sir.  I am in a whirl already; and want to attend
carefully to what you say; so that I may try to digest it."

Both men seemed fresher and better for the "easy," and when they met in
the afternoon each of them had something to contribute to the general
stock of information.  Adam, who was by nature of a more militant
disposition than his elderly friend, was glad to see that the conference
at once assumed a practical trend.  Sir Nathaniel recognised this, and,
like an old diplomatist, turned it to present use.

"Tell me now, Adam, what is the outcome, in your own mind, of our
conversation?"

"That the whole difficulty already assumes practical shape; but with
added dangers, that at first I did not imagine."

"What is the practical shape, and what are the added dangers?  I am not
disputing, but only trying to clear my own ideas by the consideration of
yours--"

So Adam went on:

"In the past, in the early days of the world, there were monsters who
were so vast that they could exist for thousands of years.  Some of them
must have overlapped the Christian era.  They may have progressed
intellectually in process of time.  If they had in any way so progressed,
or even got the most rudimentary form of brain, they would be the most
dangerous things that ever were in the world.  Tradition says that one of
these monsters lived in the Marsh of the East, and came up to a cave in
Diana's Grove, which was also called the Lair of the White Worm.  Such
creatures may have grown down as well as up.  They _may_ have grown into,
or something like, human beings.  Lady Arabella March is of snake nature.
She has committed crimes to our knowledge.  She retains something of the
vast strength of her primal being--can see in the dark--has the eyes of a
snake.  She used the nigger, and then dragged him through the snake's
hole down to the swamp; she is intent on evil, and hates some one we
love.  Result . . . "

"Yes, the result?"

"First, that Mimi Watford should be taken away at once--then--"

"Yes?"

"The monster must be destroyed."

"Bravo!  That is a true and fearless conclusion.  At whatever cost, it
must be carried out."

"At once?"

"Soon, at all events.  That creature's very existence is a danger.  Her
presence in this neighbourhood makes the danger immediate."

As he spoke, Sir Nathaniel's mouth hardened and his eyebrows came down
till they met.  There was no doubting his concurrence in the resolution,
or his readiness to help in carrying it out.  But he was an elderly man
with much experience and knowledge of law and diplomacy.  It seemed to
him to be a stern duty to prevent anything irrevocable taking place till
it had been thought out and all was ready.  There were all sorts of legal
cruxes to be thought out, not only regarding the taking of life, even of
a monstrosity in human form, but also of property.  Lady Arabella, be she
woman or snake or devil, owned the ground she moved in, according to
British law, and the law is jealous and swift to avenge wrongs done
within its ken.  All such difficulties should be--must be--avoided for
Mr. Salton's sake, for Adam's own sake, and, most of all, for Mimi
Watford's sake.

Before he spoke again, Sir Nathaniel had made up his mind that he must
try to postpone decisive action until the circumstances on which they
depended--which, after all, were only problematical--should have been
tested satisfactorily, one way or another.  When he did speak, Adam at
first thought that his friend was wavering in his intention, or "funking"
the responsibility.  However, his respect for Sir Nathaniel was so great
that he would not act, or even come to a conclusion on a vital point,
without his sanction.

He came close and whispered in his ear:

"We will prepare our plans to combat and destroy this horrible menace,
after we have cleared up some of the more baffling points.  Meanwhile, we
must wait for the night--I hear my uncle's footsteps echoing down the
hall."

Sir Nathaniel nodded his approval.




CHAPTER XXI--GREEN LIGHT


When old Mr. Salton had retired for the night, Adam and Sir Nathaniel
returned to the study.  Things went with great regularity at Lesser Hill,
so they knew that there would be no interruption to their talk.

When their cigars were lighted, Sir Nathaniel began.

"I hope, Adam, that you do not think me either slack or changeable of
purpose.  I mean to go through this business to the bitter end--whatever
it may be.  Be satisfied that my first care is, and shall be, the
protection of Mimi Watford.  To that I am pledged; my dear boy, we who
are interested are all in the same danger.  That semi-human monster out
of the pit hates and means to destroy us all--you and me certainly, and
probably your uncle.  I wanted especially to talk with you to-night, for
I cannot help thinking that the time is fast coming--if it has not come
already--when we must take your uncle into our confidence.  It was one
thing when fancied evils threatened, but now he is probably marked for
death, and it is only right that he should know all."

"I am with you, sir.  Things have changed since we agreed to keep him out
of the trouble.  Now we dare not; consideration for his feelings might
cost his life.  It is a duty--and no light or pleasant one, either.  I
have not a shadow of doubt that he will want to be one with us in this.
But remember, we are his guests; his name, his honour, have to be thought
of as well as his safety."

"All shall be as you wish, Adam.  And now as to what we are to do?  We
cannot murder Lady Arabella off-hand.  Therefore we shall have to put
things in order for the killing, and in such a way that we cannot be
taxed with a crime."

"It seems to me, sir, that we are in an exceedingly tight place.  Our
first difficulty is to know where to begin.  I never thought this
fighting an antediluvian monster would be such a complicated job.  This
one is a woman, with all a woman's wit, combined with the heartlessness
of a _cocotte_.  She has the strength and impregnability of a diplodocus.
We may be sure that in the fight that is before us there will be no
semblance of fair-play.  Also that our unscrupulous opponent will not
betray herself!"

"That is so--but being feminine, she will probably over-reach herself.
Now, Adam, it strikes me that, as we have to protect ourselves and others
against feminine nature, our strong game will be to play our masculine
against her feminine.  Perhaps we had better sleep on it.  She is a thing
of the night; and the night may give us some ideas."

So they both turned in.

Adam knocked at Sir Nathaniel's door in the grey of the morning, and, on
being bidden, came into the room.  He had several letters in his hand.
Sir Nathaniel sat up in bed.

"Well!"

"I should like to read you a few letters, but, of course, I shall not
send them unless you approve.  In fact"--with a smile and a blush--"there
are several things which I want to do; but I hold my hand and my tongue
till I have your approval."

"Go on!" said the other kindly.  "Tell me all, and count at any rate on
my sympathy, and on my approval and help if I can see my way."

Accordingly Adam proceeded:

"When I told you the conclusions at which I had arrived, I put in the
foreground that Mimi Watford should, for the sake of her own safety, be
removed--and that the monster which had wrought all the harm should be
destroyed."

"Yes, that is so."

"To carry this into practice, sir, one preliminary is required--unless
harm of another kind is to be faced.  Mimi should have some protector
whom all the world would recognise.  The only form recognised by
convention is marriage!"

Sir Nathaniel smiled in a fatherly way.

"To marry, a husband is required.  And that husband should be you."

"Yes, yes."

"And the marriage should be immediate and secret--or, at least, not
spoken of outside ourselves.  Would the young lady be agreeable to that
proceeding?"

"I do not know, sir!"

"Then how are we to proceed?"

"I suppose that we--or one of us--must ask her."

"Is this a sudden idea, Adam, a sudden resolution?"

"A sudden resolution, sir, but not a sudden idea.  If she agrees, all is
well and good.  The sequence is obvious."

"And it is to be kept a secret amongst ourselves?"

"I want no secret, sir, except for Mimi's good.  For myself, I should
like to shout it from the house-tops!  But we must be discreet; untimely
knowledge to our enemy might work incalculable harm."

"And how would you suggest, Adam, that we could combine the momentous
question with secrecy?"

Adam grew red and moved uneasily.

"Someone must ask her--as soon as possible!"

"And that someone?"

"I thought that you, sir, would be so good!"

"God bless my soul!  This is a new kind of duty to take on--at my time of
life.  Adam, I hope you know that you can count on me to help in any way
I can!"

"I have already counted on you, sir, when I ventured to make such a
suggestion.  I can only ask," he added, "that you will be more than ever
kind to me--to us--and look on the painful duty as a voluntary act of
grace, prompted by kindness and affection."

"Painful duty!"

"Yes," said Adam boldly.  "Painful to you, though to me it would be all
joyful."

"It is a strange job for an early morning!  Well, we all live and learn.
I suppose the sooner I go the better.  You had better write a line for me
to take with me.  For, you see, this is to be a somewhat unusual
transaction, and it may be embarrassing to the lady, even to myself.  So
we ought to have some sort of warrant, something to show that we have
been mindful of her feelings.  It will not do to take acquiescence for
granted--although we act for her good."

"Sir Nathaniel, you are a true friend; I am sure that both Mimi and I
shall be grateful to you for all our lives--however long they may be!"

So the two talked it over and agreed as to points to be borne in mind by
the ambassador.  It was striking ten when Sir Nathaniel left the house,
Adam seeing him quietly off.

As the young man followed him with wistful eyes--almost jealous of the
privilege which his kind deed was about to bring him--he felt that his
own heart was in his friend's breast.

The memory of that morning was like a dream to all those concerned in it.
Sir Nathaniel had a confused recollection of detail and sequence, though
the main facts stood out in his memory boldly and clearly.  Adam Salton's
recollection was of an illimitable wait, filled with anxiety, hope, and
chagrin, all dominated by a sense of the slow passage of time and
accompanied by vague fears.  Mimi could not for a long time think at all,
or recollect anything, except that Adam loved her and was saving her from
a terrible danger.  When she had time to think, later on, she wondered
when she had any ignorance of the fact that Adam loved her, and that she
loved him with all her heart.  Everything, every recollection however
small, every feeling, seemed to fit into those elemental facts as though
they had all been moulded together.  The main and crowning recollection
was her saying goodbye to Sir Nathaniel, and entrusting to him loving
messages, straight from her heart, to Adam Salton, and of his bearing
when--with an impulse which she could not check--she put her lips to his
and kissed him.  Later, when she was alone and had time to think, it was
a passing grief to her that she would have to be silent, for a time, to
Lilla on the happy events of that strange mission.

She had, of course, agreed to keep all secret until Adam should give her
leave to speak.

The advice and assistance of Sir Nathaniel was a great help to Adam in
carrying out his idea of marrying Mimi Watford without publicity.  He
went with him to London, and, with his influence, the young man obtained
the license of the Archbishop of Canterbury for a private marriage.  Sir
Nathaniel then persuaded old Mr. Salton to allow his nephew to spend a
few weeks with him at Doom Tower, and it was here that Mimi became Adam's
wife.  But that was only the first step in their plans; before going
further, however, Adam took his bride off to the Isle of Man.  He wished
to place a stretch of sea between Mimi and the White Worm, while things
matured.  On their return, Sir Nathaniel met them and drove them at once
to Doom, taking care to avoid any one that he knew on the journey.

Sir Nathaniel had taken care to have the doors and windows shut and
locked--all but the door used for their entry.  The shutters were up and
the blinds down.  Moreover, heavy curtains were drawn across the windows.
When Adam commented on this, Sir Nathaniel said in a whisper:

"Wait till we are alone, and I'll tell you why this is done; in the
meantime not a word or a sign.  You will approve when we have had a talk
together."

They said no more on the subject till after dinner, when they were
ensconced in Sir Nathaniel's study, which was on the top storey.  Doom
Tower was a lofty structure, situated on an eminence high up in the Peak.
The top commanded a wide prospect, ranging from the hills above the
Ribble to the near side of the Brow, which marked the northern bound of
ancient Mercia.  It was of the early Norman period, less than a century
younger than Castra Regis.  The windows of the study were barred and
locked, and heavy dark curtains closed them in.  When this was done not a
gleam of light from the tower could be seen from outside.

When they were alone, Sir Nathaniel explained that he had taken his old
friend, Mr. Salton, into full confidence, and that in future all would
work together.

"It is important for you to be extremely careful.  In spite of the fact
that our marriage was kept secret, as also your temporary absence, both
are known."

"How?  To whom?"

"How, I know not; but I am beginning to have an idea."

"To her?" asked Adam, in momentary consternation.

Sir Nathaniel shivered perceptibly.

"The White Worm--yes!"

Adam noticed that from now on, his friend never spoke of Lady Arabella
otherwise, except when he wished to divert the suspicion of others.

Sir Nathaniel switched off the electric light, and when the room was
pitch dark, he came to Adam, took him by the hand, and led him to a seat
set in the southern window.  Then he softly drew back a piece of the
curtain and motioned his companion to look out.

Adam did so, and immediately shrank back as though his eyes had opened on
pressing danger.  His companion set his mind at rest by saying in a low
voice:

"It is all right; you may speak, but speak low.  There is no danger
here--at present!"

Adam leaned forward, taking care, however, not to press his face against
the glass.  What he saw would not under ordinary circumstances have
caused concern to anybody.  With his special knowledge, it was
appalling--though the night was now so dark that in reality there was
little to be seen.

On the western side of the tower stood a grove of old trees, of forest
dimensions.  They were not grouped closely, but stood a little apart from
each other, producing the effect of a row widely planted.  Over the tops
of them was seen a green light, something like the danger signal at a
railway-crossing.  It seemed at first quite still; but presently, when
Adam's eye became accustomed to it, he could see that it moved as if
trembling.  This at once recalled to Adam's mind the light quivering
above the well-hole in the darkness of that inner room at Diana's Grove,
Oolanga's awful shriek, and the hideous black face, now grown grey with
terror, disappearing into the impenetrable gloom of the mysterious
orifice.  Instinctively he laid his hand on his revolver, and stood up
ready to protect his wife.  Then, seeing that nothing happened, and that
the light and all outside the tower remained the same, he softly pulled
the curtain over the window.

Sir Nathaniel switched on the light again, and in its comforting glow
they began to talk freely.




CHAPTER XXII--AT CLOSE QUARTERS


"She has diabolical cunning," said Sir Nathaniel.  "Ever since you left,
she has ranged along the Brow and wherever you were accustomed to
frequent.  I have not heard whence the knowledge of your movements came
to her, nor have I been able to learn any data whereon to found an
opinion.  She seems to have heard both of your marriage and your absence;
but I gather, by inference, that she does not actually know where you and
Mimi are, or of your return.  So soon as the dusk fails, she goes out on
her rounds, and before dawn covers the whole ground round the Brow, and
away up into the heart of the Peak.  The White Worm, in her own proper
shape, certainly has great facilities for the business on which she is
now engaged.  She can look into windows of any ordinary kind.  Happily,
this house is beyond her reach, if she wishes--as she manifestly does--to
remain unrecognised.  But, even at this height, it is wise to show no
lights, lest she might learn something of our presence or absence."

"Would it not be well, sir, if one of us could see this monster in her
real shape at close quarters?  I am willing to run the risk--for I take
it there would be no slight risk in the doing.  I don't suppose anyone of
our time has seen her close and lived to tell the tale."

Sir Nathaniel held up an expostulatory hand.

"Good God, lad, what are you suggesting?  Think of your wife, and all
that is at stake."

"It is of Mimi that I think--for her sake that I am willing to risk
whatever is to be risked."

Adam's young bride was proud of her man, but she blanched at the thought
of the ghastly White Worm.  Adam saw this and at once reassured her.

"So long as her ladyship does not know whereabout I am, I shall have as
much safety as remains to us; bear in mind, my darling, that we cannot be
too careful."

Sir Nathaniel realised that Adam was right; the White Worm had no
supernatural powers and could not harm them until she discovered their
hiding place.  It was agreed, therefore, that the two men should go
together.

When the two men slipped out by the back door of the house, they walked
cautiously along the avenue which trended towards the west.  Everything
was pitch dark--so dark that at times they had to feel their way by the
palings and tree-trunks.  They could still see, seemingly far in front of
them and high up, the baleful light which at the height and distance
seemed like a faint line.  As they were now on the level of the ground,
the light seemed infinitely higher than it had from the top of the tower.
At the sight Adam's heart fell; the danger of the desperate enterprise
which he had undertaken burst upon him.  But this feeling was shortly
followed by another which restored him to himself--a fierce loathing, and
a desire to kill, such as he had never experienced before.

They went on for some distance on a level road, fairly wide, from which
the green light was visible.  Here Sir Nathaniel spoke softly, placing
his lips to Adam's ear for safety.

"We know nothing whatever of this creature's power of hearing or
smelling, though I presume that both are of no great strength.  As to
seeing, we may presume the opposite, but in any case we must try to keep
in the shade behind the tree-trunks.  The slightest error would be fatal
to us."

Adam only nodded, in case there should be any chance of the monster
seeing the movement.

After a time that seemed interminable, they emerged from the circling
wood.  It was like coming out into sunlight by comparison with the misty
blackness which had been around them.  There was light enough to see by,
though not sufficient to distinguish things at a distance.  Adam's eyes
sought the green light in the sky.  It was still in about the same place,
but its surroundings were more visible.  It was now at the summit of what
seemed to be a long white pole, near the top of which were two pendant
white masses, like rudimentary arms or fins.  The green light, strangely
enough, did not seem lessened by the surrounding starlight, but had a
clearer effect and a deeper green.  Whilst they were carefully regarding
this--Adam with the aid of an opera-glass--their nostrils were assailed
by a horrid stench, something like that which rose from the well-hole in
Diana's Grove.

By degrees, as their eyes got the right focus, they saw an immense
towering mass that seemed snowy white.  It was tall and thin.  The lower
part was hidden by the trees which lay between, but they could follow the
tall white shaft and the duplicate green lights which topped it.  As they
looked there was a movement--the shaft seemed to bend, and the line of
green light descended amongst the trees.  They could see the green light
twinkle as it passed between the obstructing branches.

Seeing where the head of the monster was, the two men ventured a little
further forward, and saw that the hidden mass at the base of the shaft
was composed of vast coils of the great serpent's body, forming a base
from which the upright mass rose.  As they looked, this lower mass moved,
the glistening folds catching the moonlight, and they could see that the
monster's progress was along the ground.  It was coming towards them at a
swift pace, so they turned and ran, taking care to make as little noise
as possible, either by their footfalls or by disturbing the undergrowth
close to them.  They did not stop or pause till they saw before them the
high dark tower of Doom.




CHAPTER XXIII--IN THE ENEMY'S HOUSE


Sir Nathaniel was in the library next morning, after breakfast, when Adam
came to him carrying a letter.

"Her ladyship doesn't lose any time.  She has begun work already!"

Sir Nathaniel, who was writing at a table near the window, looked up.

"What is it?" said he.

Adam held out the letter he was carrying.  It was in a blazoned envelope.

"Ha!" said Sir Nathaniel, "from the White Worm!  I expected something of
the kind."

"But," said Adam, "how could she have known we were here?  She didn't
know last night."

"I don't think we need trouble about that, Adam.  There is so much we do
not understand.  This is only another mystery.  Suffice it that she does
know--perhaps it is all the better and safer for us."

"How is that?" asked Adam with a puzzled look.

"General process of reasoning, my boy; and the experience of some years
in the diplomatic world.  This creature is a monster without heart or
consideration for anything or anyone.  She is not nearly so dangerous in
the open as when she has the dark to protect her.  Besides, we know, by
our own experience of her movements, that for some reason she shuns
publicity.  In spite of her vast bulk and abnormal strength, she is
afraid to attack openly.  After all, she is only a snake and with a
snake's nature, which is to keep low and squirm, and proceed by stealth
and cunning.  She will never attack when she can run away, although she
knows well that running away would probably be fatal to her.  What is the
letter about?"

Sir Nathaniel's voice was calm and self-possessed.  When he was engaged
in any struggle of wits he was all diplomatist.

"She asks Mimi and me to tea this afternoon at Diana's Grove, and hopes
that you also will favour her."

Sir Nathaniel smiled.

"Please ask Mrs. Salton to accept for us all."

"She means some deadly mischief.  Surely--surely it would be wiser not."

"It is an old trick that we learn early in diplomacy, Adam--to fight on
ground of your own choice.  It is true that she suggested the place on
this occasion; but by accepting it we make it ours.  Moreover, she will
not be able to understand our reason for doing so, and her own bad
conscience--if she has any, bad or good--and her own fears and doubts
will play our game for us.  No, my dear boy, let us accept, by all
means."

Adam said nothing, but silently held out his hand, which his companion
shook: no words were necessary.

When it was getting near tea-time, Mimi asked Sir Nathaniel how they were
going.

"We must make a point of going in state.  We want all possible
publicity."  Mimi looked at him inquiringly.  "Certainly, my dear, in the
present circumstances publicity is a part of safety.  Do not be surprised
if, whilst we are at Diana's Grove, occasional messages come for you--for
all or any of us."

"I see!" said Mrs. Salton.  "You are taking no chances."

"None, my dear.  All I have learned at foreign courts, and amongst
civilised and uncivilised people, is going to be utilised within the next
couple of hours."

Sir Nathaniel's voice was full of seriousness, and it brought to Mimi in
a convincing way the awful gravity of the occasion.

In due course, they set out in a carriage drawn by a fine pair of horses,
who soon devoured the few miles of their journey.  Before they came to
the gate, Sir Nathaniel turned to Mimi.

"I have arranged with Adam certain signals which may be necessary if
certain eventualities occur.  These need be nothing to do with you
directly.  But bear in mind that if I ask you or Adam to do anything, do
not lose a second in the doing of it.  We must try to pass off such
moments with an appearance of unconcern.  In all probability, nothing
requiring such care will occur.  The White Worm will not try force,
though she has so much of it to spare.  Whatever she may attempt to-day,
of harm to any of us, will be in the way of secret plot.  Some other time
she may try force, but--if I am able to judge such a thing--not to-day.
The messengers who may ask for any of us will not be witnesses only, they
may help to stave off danger."  Seeing query in her face, he went on: "Of
what kind the danger may be, I know not, and cannot guess.  It will
doubtless be some ordinary circumstance; but none the less dangerous on
that account.  Here we are at the gate.  Now, be careful in all matters,
however small.  To keep your head is half the battle."

There were a number of men in livery in the hall when they arrived.  The
doors of the drawing-room were thrown open, and Lady Arabella came forth
and offered them cordial welcome.  This having been got over, Lady
Arabella led them into another room where tea was served.

Adam was acutely watchful and suspicious of everything, and saw on the
far side of this room a panelled iron door of the same colour and
configuration as the outer door of the room where was the well-hole
wherein Oolanga had disappeared.  Something in the sight alarmed him, and
he quietly stood near the door.  He made no movement, even of his eyes,
but he could see that Sir Nathaniel was watching him intently, and, he
fancied, with approval.

They all sat near the table spread for tea, Adam still near the door.
Lady Arabella fanned herself, complaining of heat, and told one of the
footmen to throw all the outer doors open.

Tea was in progress when Mimi suddenly started up with a look of fright
on her face; at the same moment, the men became cognisant of a thick
smoke which began to spread through the room--a smoke which made those
who experienced it gasp and choke.  The footmen began to edge uneasily
towards the inner door.  Denser and denser grew the smoke, and more acrid
its smell.  Mimi, towards whom the draught from the open door wafted the
smoke, rose up choking, and ran to the inner door, which she threw open
to its fullest extent, disclosing on the outside a curtain of thin silk,
fixed to the doorposts.  The draught from the open door swayed the thin
silk towards her, and in her fright, she tore down the curtain, which
enveloped her from head to foot.  Then she ran through the still open
door, heedless of the fact that she could not see where she was going.
Adam, followed by Sir Nathaniel, rushed forward and joined her--Adam
catching his wife by the arm and holding her tight.  It was well that he
did so, for just before her lay the black orifice of the well-hole,
which, of course, she could not see with the silk curtain round her head.
The floor was extremely slippery; something like thick oil had been
spilled where she had to pass; and close to the edge of the hole her feet
shot from under her, and she stumbled forward towards the well-hole.

When Adam saw Mimi slip, he flung himself backward, still holding her.
His weight told, and he dragged her up from the hole and they fell
together on the floor outside the zone of slipperiness.  In a moment he
had raised her up, and together they rushed out through the open door
into the sunlight, Sir Nathaniel close behind them.  They were all pale
except the old diplomatist, who looked both calm and cool.  It sustained
and cheered Adam and his wife to see him thus master of himself.  Both
managed to follow his example, to the wonderment of the footmen, who saw
the three who had just escaped a terrible danger walking together gaily,
as, under the guiding pressure of Sir Nathaniel's hand, they turned to re-
enter the house.

Lady Arabella, whose face had blanched to a deadly white, now resumed her
ministrations at the tea-board as though nothing unusual had happened.
The slop-basin was full of half-burned brown paper, over which tea had
been poured.

Sir Nathaniel had been narrowly observing his hostess, and took the first
opportunity afforded him of whispering to Adam:

"The real attack is to come--she is too quiet.  When I give my hand to
your wife to lead her out, come with us--and caution her to hurry.  Don't
lose a second, even if you have to make a scene.  Hs-s-s-h!"

Then they resumed their places close to the table, and the servants, in
obedience to Lady Arabella's order, brought in fresh tea.

Thence on, that tea-party seemed to Adam, whose faculties were at their
utmost intensity, like a terrible dream.  As for poor Mimi, she was so
overwrought both with present and future fear, and with horror at the
danger she had escaped, that her faculties were numb.  However, she was
braced up for a trial, and she felt assured that whatever might come she
would be able to go through with it.  Sir Nathaniel seemed just as
usual--suave, dignified, and thoughtful--perfect master of himself.

To her husband, it was evident that Mimi was ill at ease.  The way she
kept turning her head to look around her, the quick coming and going of
the colour of her face, her hurried breathing, alternating with periods
of suspicious calm, were evidences of mental perturbation.  To her, the
attitude of Lady Arabella seemed compounded of social sweetness and
personal consideration.  It would be hard to imagine more thoughtful and
tender kindness towards an honoured guest.

When tea was over and the servants had come to clear away the cups, Lady
Arabella, putting her arm round Mimi's waist, strolled with her into an
adjoining room, where she collected a number of photographs which were
scattered about, and, sitting down beside her guest, began to show them
to her.  While she was doing this, the servants closed all the doors of
the suite of rooms, as well as that which opened from the room
outside--that of the well-hole into the avenue.  Suddenly, without any
seeming cause, the light in the room began to grow dim.  Sir Nathaniel,
who was sitting close to Mimi, rose to his feet, and, crying, "Quick!"
caught hold of her hand and began to drag her from the room.  Adam caught
her other hand, and between them they drew her through the outer door
which the servants were beginning to close.  It was difficult at first to
find the way, the darkness was so great; but to their relief when Adam
whistled shrilly, the carriage and horses, which had been waiting in the
angle of the avenue, dashed up.  Her husband and Sir Nathaniel
lifted--almost threw--Mimi into the carriage.  The postillion plied whip
and spur, and the vehicle, rocking with its speed, swept through the gate
and tore up the road.  Behind them was a hubbub--servants rushing about,
orders being shouted out, doors shutting, and somewhere, seemingly far
back in the house, a strange noise.  Every nerve of the horses was
strained as they dashed recklessly along the road.  The two men held Mimi
between them, the arms of both of them round her as though protectingly.
As they went, there was a sudden rise in the ground; but the horses,
breathing heavily, dashed up it at racing speed, not slackening their
pace when the hill fell away again, leaving them to hurry along the
downgrade.

It would be foolish to say that neither Adam nor Mimi had any fear in
returning to Doom Tower.  Mimi felt it more keenly than her husband,
whose nerves were harder, and who was more inured to danger.  Still she
bore up bravely, and as usual the effort was helpful to her.  When once
she was in the study in the top of the turret, she almost forgot the
terrors which lay outside in the dark.  She did not attempt to peep out
of the window; but Adam did--and saw nothing.  The moonlight showed all
the surrounding country, but nowhere was to be observed that tremulous
line of green light.

The peaceful night had a good effect on them all; danger, being unseen,
seemed far off.  At times it was hard to realise that it had ever been.
With courage restored, Adam rose early and walked along the Brow, seeing
no change in the signs of life in Castra Regis.  What he did see, to his
wonder and concern, on his returning homeward, was Lady Arabella, in her
tight-fitting white dress and ermine collar, but without her emeralds;
she was emerging from the gate of Diana's Grove and walking towards the
Castle.  Pondering on this, and trying to find some meaning in it,
occupied his thoughts till he joined Mimi and Sir Nathaniel at breakfast.
They began the meal in silence.  What had been had been, and was known to
them all.  Moreover, it was not a pleasant topic.

A fillip was given to the conversation when Adam told of his seeing Lady
Arabella, on her way to Castra Regis.  They each had something to say of
her, and of what her wishes or intentions were towards Edgar Caswall.
Mimi spoke bitterly of her in every aspect.  She had not forgotten--and
never would--never could--the occasion when, to harm Lilla, the woman had
consorted even with the nigger.  As a social matter, she was disgusted
with her for following up the rich landowner--"throwing herself at his
head so shamelessly," was how she expressed it.  She was interested to
know that the great kite still flew from Caswall's tower.  But beyond
such matters she did not try to go.  The only comment she made was of
strongly expressed surprise at her ladyship's "cheek" in ignoring her own
criminal acts, and her impudence in taking it for granted that others had
overlooked them also.




CHAPTER XXIV--A STARTLING PROPOSITION


The more Mimi thought over the late events, the more puzzled she was.
What did it all mean--what could it mean, except that there was an error
of fact somewhere.  Could it be possible that some of them--all of them
had been mistaken, that there had been no White Worm at all?  On either
side of her was a belief impossible of reception.  Not to believe in what
seemed apparent was to destroy the very foundations of belief . . . yet
in old days there had been monsters on the earth, and certainly some
people had believed in just such mysterious changes of identity.  It was
all very strange.  Just fancy how any stranger--say a doctor--would
regard her, if she were to tell him that she had been to a tea-party with
an antediluvian monster, and that they had been waited on by up-to-date
men-servants.

Adam had returned, exhilarated by his walk, and more settled in his mind
than he had been for some time.  Like Mimi, he had gone through the phase
of doubt and inability to believe in the reality of things, though it had
not affected him to the same extent.  The idea, however, that his wife
was suffering ill-effects from her terrible ordeal, braced him up.  He
remained with her for a time, then he sought Sir Nathaniel in order to
talk over the matter with him.  He knew that the calm common sense and
self-reliance of the old man, as well as his experience, would be helpful
to them all.

Sir Nathaniel had come to the conclusion that, for some reason which he
did not understand, Lady Arabella had changed her plans, and, for the
present at all events, was pacific.  He was inclined to attribute her
changed demeanour to the fact that her influence over Edgar Caswall was
so far increased, as to justify a more fixed belief in his submission to
her charms.

As a matter of fact, she had seen Caswall that morning when she visited
Castra Regis, and they had had a long talk together, during which the
possibility of their union had been discussed.  Caswall, without being
enthusiastic on the subject, had been courteous and attentive; as she had
walked back to Diana's Grove, she almost congratulated herself on her new
settlement in life.  That the idea was becoming fixed in her mind, was
shown by a letter which she wrote later in the day to Adam Salton, and
sent to him by hand.  It ran as follows:

   "DEAR MR. SALTON,

   "I wonder if you would kindly advise, and, if possible, help me in a
   matter of business.  I have been for some time trying to make up my
   mind to sell Diana's Grove, I have put off and put off the doing of it
   till now.  The place is my own property, and no one has to be
   consulted with regard to what I may wish to do about it.  It was
   bought by my late husband, Captain Adolphus Ranger March, who had
   another residence, The Crest, Appleby.  He acquired all rights of all
   kinds, including mining and sporting.  When he died, he left his whole
   property to me.  I shall feel leaving this place, which has become
   endeared to me by many sacred memories and affections--the
   recollection of many happy days of my young married life, and the more
   than happy memories of the man I loved and who loved me so much.  I
   should be willing to sell the place for any fair price--so long, of
   course, as the purchaser was one I liked and of whom I approved.  May
   I say that you yourself would be the ideal person.  But I dare not
   hope for so much.  It strikes me, however, that among your Australian
   friends may be someone who wishes to make a settlement in the Old
   Country, and would care to fix the spot in one of the most historic
   regions in England, full of romance and legend, and with a
   never-ending vista of historical interest--an estate which, though
   small, is in perfect condition and with illimitable possibilities of
   development, and many doubtful--or unsettled--rights which have
   existed before the time of the Romans or even Celts, who were the
   original possessors.  In addition, the house has been kept up to the
   _dernier cri_.  Immediate possession can be arranged.  My lawyers can
   provide you, or whoever you may suggest, with all business and
   historical details.  A word from you of acceptance or refusal is all
   that is necessary, and we can leave details to be thrashed out by our
   agents.  Forgive me, won't you, for troubling you in the matter, and
   believe me, yours very sincerely.

   "ARABELLA MARCH."

Adam read this over several times, and then, his mind being made up, he
went to Mimi and asked if she had any objection.  She answered--after a
shudder--that she was, in this, as in all things, willing to do whatever
he might wish.

"Dearest, I am willing that you should judge what is best for us.  Be
quite free to act as you see your duty, and as your inclination calls.  We
are in the hands of God, and He has hitherto guided us, and will do so to
His own end."

From his wife's room Adam Salton went straight to the study in the tower,
where he knew Sir Nathaniel would be at that hour.  The old man was
alone, so, when he had entered in obedience to the "Come in," which
answered his query, he closed the door and sat down beside him.

"Do you think, sir, that it would be well for me to buy Diana's Grove?"

"God bless my soul!" said the old man, startled, "why on earth would you
want to do that?"

"Well, I have vowed to destroy that White Worm, and my being able to do
whatever I may choose with the Lair would facilitate matters and avoid
complications."

Sir Nathaniel hesitated longer than usual before speaking.  He was
thinking deeply.

"Yes, Adam, there is much common sense in your suggestion, though it
startled me at first.  I think that, for all reasons, you would do well
to buy the property and to have the conveyance settled at once.  If you
want more money than is immediately convenient, let me know, so that I
may be your banker."

"Thank you, sir, most heartily; but I have more money at immediate call
than I shall want.  I am glad you approve."

"The property is historic, and as time goes on it will increase in value.
Moreover, I may tell you something, which indeed is only a surmise, but
which, if I am right, will add great value to the place."  Adam listened.
"Has it ever struck you why the old name, 'The Lair of the White Worm,'
was given?  We know that there was a snake which in early days was called
a worm; but why white?"

"I really don't know, sir; I never thought of it.  I simply took it for
granted."

"So did I at first--long ago.  But later I puzzled my brain for a
reason."

"And what was the reason, sir?"

"Simply and solely because the snake or worm _was_ white.  We are near
the county of Stafford, where the great industry of china-burning was
originated and grew.  Stafford owes much of its wealth to the large
deposits of the rare china clay found in it from time to time.  These
deposits become in time pretty well exhausted; but for centuries Stafford
adventurers looked for the special clay, as Ohio and Pennsylvania farmers
and explorers looked for oil.  Anyone owning real estate on which china
clay can be discovered strikes a sort of gold mine."

"Yes, and then--"  The young man looked puzzled.

"The original 'Worm' so-called, from which the name of the place came,
had to find a direct way down to the marshes and the mud-holes.  Now, the
clay is easily penetrable, and the original hole probably pierced a bed
of china clay.  When once the way was made it would become a sort of
highway for the Worm.  But as much movement was necessary to ascend such
a great height, some of the clay would become attached to its rough skin
by attrition.  The downway must have been easy work, but the ascent was
different, and when the monster came to view in the upper world, it would
be fresh from contact with the white clay.  Hence the name, which has no
cryptic significance, but only fact.  Now, if that surmise be true--and I
do not see why not--there must be a deposit of valuable clay--possibly of
immense depth."

Adam's comment pleased the old gentleman.

"I have it in my bones, sir, that you have struck--or rather reasoned
out--a great truth."

Sir Nathaniel went on cheerfully.  "When the world of commerce wakes up
to the value of your find, it will be as well that your title to
ownership has been perfectly secured.  If anyone ever deserved such a
gain, it is you."

With his friend's aid, Adam secured the property without loss of time.
Then he went to see his uncle, and told him about it.  Mr. Salton was
delighted to find his young relative already constructively the owner of
so fine an estate--one which gave him an important status in the county.
He made many anxious enquiries about Mimi, and the doings of the White
Worm, but Adam reassured him.

The next morning, when Adam went to his host in the smoking-room, Sir
Nathaniel asked him how he purposed to proceed with regard to keeping his
vow.

"It is a difficult matter which you have undertaken.  To destroy such a
monster is something like one of the labours of Hercules, in that not
only its size and weight and power of using them in little-known ways are
against you, but the occult side is alone an unsurpassable difficulty.
The Worm is already master of all the elements except fire--and I do not
see how fire can be used for the attack.  It has only to sink into the
earth in its usual way, and you could not overtake it if you had the
resources of the biggest coal-mine in existence.  But I daresay you have
mapped out some plan in your mind," he added courteously.

"I have, sir.  But, of course, it may not stand the test of practice."

"May I know the idea?"

"Well, sir, this was my argument: At the time of the Chartist trouble, an
idea spread amongst financial circles that an attack was going to be made
on the Bank of England.  Accordingly, the directors of that institution
consulted many persons who were supposed to know what steps should be
taken, and it was finally decided that the best protection against
fire--which is what was feared--was not water but sand.  To carry the
scheme into practice great store of fine sea-sand--the kind that blows
about and is used to fill hour-glasses--was provided throughout the
building, especially at the points liable to attack, from which it could
be brought into use.

"I propose to provide at Diana's Grove, as soon as it comes into my
possession, an enormous amount of such sand, and shall take an early
occasion of pouring it into the well-hole, which it will in time choke.
Thus Lady Arabella, in her guise of the White Worm, will find herself cut
off from her refuge.  The hole is a narrow one, and is some hundreds of
feet deep.  The weight of the sand this can contain would not in itself
be sufficient to obstruct; but the friction of such a body working up
against it would be tremendous."

"One moment.  What use would the sand be for destruction?"

"None, directly; but it would hold the struggling body in place till the
rest of my scheme came into practice."

"And what is the rest?"

"As the sand is being poured into the well-hole, quantities of dynamite
can also be thrown in!"

"Good.  But how would the dynamite explode--for, of course, that is what
you intend.  Would not some sort of wire or fuse he required for each
parcel of dynamite?"

Adam smiled.

"Not in these days, sir.  That was proved in New York.  A thousand pounds
of dynamite, in sealed canisters, was placed about some workings.  At the
last a charge of gunpowder was fired, and the concussion exploded the
dynamite.  It was most successful.  Those who were non-experts in high
explosives expected that every pane of glass in New York would be
shattered.  But, in reality, the explosive did no harm outside the area
intended, although sixteen acres of rock had been mined and only the
supporting walls and pillars had been left intact.  The whole of the
rocks were shattered."

Sir Nathaniel nodded approval.

"That seems a good plan--a very excellent one.  But if it has to tear
down so many feet of precipice, it may wreck the whole neighbourhood."

"And free it for ever from a monster," added Adam, as he left the room to
find his wife.




CHAPTER XXV--THE LAST BATTLE


Lady Arabella had instructed her solicitors to hurry on with the
conveyance of Diana's Grove, so no time was lost in letting Adam Salton
have formal possession of the estate.  After his interview with Sir
Nathaniel, he had taken steps to begin putting his plan into action.  In
order to accumulate the necessary amount of fine sea-sand, he ordered the
steward to prepare for an elaborate system of top-dressing all the
grounds.  A great heap of the sand, brought from bays on the Welsh coast,
began to grow at the back of the Grove.  No one seemed to suspect that it
was there for any purpose other than what had been given out.

Lady Arabella, who alone could have guessed, was now so absorbed in her
matrimonial pursuit of Edgar Caswall, that she had neither time nor
inclination for thought extraneous to this.  She had not yet moved from
the house, though she had formally handed over the estate.

Adam put up a rough corrugated-iron shed behind the Grove, in which he
stored his explosives.  All being ready for his great attempt whenever
the time should come, he was now content to wait, and, in order to pass
the time, interested himself in other things--even in Caswall's great
kite, which still flew from the high tower of Castra Regis.

The mound of fine sand grew to proportions so vast as to puzzle the
bailiffs and farmers round the Brow.  The hour of the intended cataclysm
was approaching apace.  Adam wished--but in vain--for an opportunity,
which would appear to be natural, of visiting Caswall in the turret of
Castra Regis.  At last, one morning, he met Lady Arabella moving towards
the Castle, so he took his courage _a deux mains_ and asked to be allowed
to accompany her.  She was glad, for her own purposes, to comply with his
wishes.  So together they entered, and found their way to the
turret-room.  Caswall was much surprised to see Adam come to his house,
but lent himself to the task of seeming to be pleased.  He played the
host so well as to deceive even Adam.  They all went out on the turret
roof, where he explained to his guests the mechanism for raising and
lowering the kite, taking also the opportunity of testing the movements
of the multitudes of birds, how they answered almost instantaneously to
the lowering or raising of the kite.

As Lady Arabella walked home with Adam from Castra Regis, she asked him
if she might make a request.  Permission having been accorded, she
explained that before she finally left Diana's Grove, where she had lived
so long, she had a desire to know the depth of the well-hole.  Adam was
really happy to meet her wishes, not from any sentiment, but because he
wished to give some valid and ostensible reason for examining the passage
of the Worm, which would obviate any suspicion resulting from his being
on the premises.  He brought from London a Kelvin sounding apparatus,
with a sufficient length of piano-wire for testing any probable depth.
The wire passed easily over the running wheel, and when this was once
fixed over the hole, he was satisfied to wait till the most advantageous
time for his final experiment.

* * * * *

In the meantime, affairs had been going quietly at Mercy Farm.  Lilla, of
course, felt lonely in the absence of her cousin, but the even tenor of
life went on for her as for others.  After the first shock of parting was
over, things went back to their accustomed routine.  In one respect,
however, there was a marked difference.  So long as home conditions had
remained unchanged, Lilla was content to put ambition far from her, and
to settle down to the life which had been hers as long as she could
remember.  But Mimi's marriage set her thinking; naturally, she came to
the conclusion that she too might have a mate.  There was not for her
much choice--there was little movement in the matrimonial direction at
the farmhouse.  She did not approve of the personality of Edgar Caswall,
and his struggle with Mimi had frightened her; but he was unmistakably an
excellent _parti_, much better than she could have any right to expect.
This weighs much with a woman, and more particularly one of her class.
So, on the whole, she was content to let things take their course, and to
abide by the issue.

As time went on, she had reason to believe that things did not point to
happiness.  She could not shut her eyes to certain disturbing facts,
amongst which were the existence of Lady Arabella and her growing
intimacy with Edgar Caswall; as well as his own cold and haughty nature,
so little in accord with the ardour which is the foundation of a young
maid's dreams of happiness.  How things would, of necessity, alter if she
were to marry, she was afraid to think.  All told, the prospect was not
happy for her, and she had a secret longing that something might occur to
upset the order of things as at present arranged.

When Lilla received a note from Edgar Caswall asking if he might come to
tea on the following afternoon, her heart sank within her.  If it was
only for her father's sake, she must not refuse him or show any
disinclination which he might construe into incivility.  She missed Mimi
more than she could say or even dared to think.  Hitherto, she had always
looked to her cousin for sympathy, for understanding, for loyal support.
Now she and all these things, and a thousand others--gentle, assuring,
supporting--were gone.  And instead there was a horrible aching void.

For the whole afternoon and evening, and for the following forenoon, poor
Lilla's loneliness grew to be a positive agony.  For the first time she
began to realise the sense of her loss, as though all the previous
suffering had been merely a preparation.  Everything she looked at,
everything she remembered or thought of, became laden with poignant
memory.  Then on the top of all was a new sense of dread.  The reaction
from the sense of security, which had surrounded her all her life, to a
never-quieted apprehension, was at times almost more than she could bear.
It so filled her with fear that she had a haunting feeling that she would
as soon die as live.  However, whatever might be her own feelings, duty
had to be done, and as she had been brought up to consider duty first,
she braced herself to go through, to the very best of her ability, what
was before her.

Still, the severe and prolonged struggle for self-control told upon
Lilla.  She looked, as she felt, ill and weak.  She was really in a
nerveless and prostrate condition, with black circles round her eyes,
pale even to her lips, and with an instinctive trembling which she was
quite unable to repress.  It was for her a sad mischance that Mimi was
away, for her love would have seen through all obscuring causes, and have
brought to light the girl's unhappy condition of health.  Lilla was
utterly unable to do anything to escape from the ordeal before her; but
her cousin, with the experience of her former struggles with Mr. Caswall
and of the condition in which these left her, would have taken steps--even
peremptory ones, if necessary--to prevent a repetition.

Edgar arrived punctually to the time appointed by herself.  When Lilla,
through the great window, saw him approaching the house, her condition of
nervous upset was pitiable.  She braced herself up, however, and managed
to get through the interview in its preliminary stages without any
perceptible change in her normal appearance and bearing.  It had been to
her an added terror that the black shadow of Oolanga, whom she dreaded,
would follow hard on his master.  A load was lifted from her mind when he
did not make his usual stealthy approach.  She had also feared, though in
lesser degree, lest Lady Arabella should be present to make trouble for
her as before.

With a woman's natural forethought in a difficult position, she had
provided the furnishing of the tea-table as a subtle indication of the
social difference between her and her guest.  She had chosen the
implements of service, as well as all the provender set forth, of the
humblest kind.  Instead of arranging the silver teapot and china cups,
she had set out an earthen teapot, such as was in common use in the farm
kitchen.  The same idea was carried out in the cups and saucers of thick
homely delft, and in the cream-jug of similar kind.  The bread was of
simple whole-meal, home-baked.  The butter was good, since she had made
it herself, while the preserves and honey came from her own garden.  Her
face beamed with satisfaction when the guest eyed the appointments with a
supercilious glance.  It was a shock to the poor girl herself, for she
enjoyed offering to a guest the little hospitalities possible to her; but
that had to be sacrificed with other pleasures.

Caswall's face was more set and iron-clad than ever--his piercing eyes
seemed from the very beginning to look her through and through.  Her
heart quailed when she thought of what would follow--of what would be the
end, when this was only the beginning.  As some protection, though it
could be only of a sentimental kind, she brought from her own room the
photographs of Mimi, of her grandfather, and of Adam Salton, whom by now
she had grown to look on with reliance, as a brother whom she could
trust.  She kept the pictures near her heart, to which her hand naturally
strayed when her feelings of constraint, distrust, or fear became so
poignant as to interfere with the calm which she felt was necessary to
help her through her ordeal.

At first Edgar Caswall was courteous and polite, even thoughtful; but
after a little while, when he found her resistance to his domination
grow, he abandoned all forms of self-control and appeared in the same
dominance as he had previously shown.  She was prepared, however, for
this, both by her former experience and the natural fighting instinct
within her.  By this means, as the minutes went on, both developed the
power and preserved the equality in which they had begun.

Without warning, the psychic battle between the two individualities began
afresh.  This time both the positive and negative causes were all in
favour of the man.  The woman was alone and in bad spirits, unsupported;
nothing at all was in her favour except the memory of the two victorious
contests; whereas the man, though unaided, as before, by either Lady
Arabella or Oolanga, was in full strength, well rested, and in
flourishing circumstances.  It was not, therefore, to be wondered at that
his native dominance of character had full opportunity of asserting
itself.  He began his preliminary stare with a conscious sense of power,
and, as it appeared to have immediate effect on the girl, he felt an ever-
growing conviction of ultimate victory.

After a little Lilla's resolution began to flag.  She felt that the
contest was unequal--that she was unable to put forth her best efforts.
As she was an unselfish person, she could not fight so well in her own
battle as in that of someone whom she loved and to whom she was devoted.
Edgar saw the relaxing of the muscles of face and brow, and the almost
collapse of the heavy eyelids which seemed tumbling downward in sleep.
Lilla made gallant efforts to brace her dwindling powers, but for a time
unsuccessfully.  At length there came an interruption, which seemed like
a powerful stimulant.  Through the wide window she saw Lady Arabella
enter the plain gateway of the farm, and advance towards the hall door.
She was clad as usual in tight-fitting white, which accentuated her thin,
sinuous figure.

The sight did for Lilla what no voluntary effort could have done.  Her
eyes flashed, and in an instant she felt as though a new life had
suddenly developed within her.  Lady Arabella's entry, in her usual
unconcerned, haughty, supercilious way, heightened the effect, so that
when the two stood close to each other battle was joined.  Mr. Caswall,
too, took new courage from her coming, and all his masterfulness and
power came back to him.  His looks, intensified, had more obvious effect
than had been noticeable that day.  Lilla seemed at last overcome by his
dominance.  Her face became red and pale--violently red and ghastly
pale--by rapid turns.  Her strength seemed gone.  Her knees collapsed,
and she was actually sinking on the floor, when to her surprise and joy
Mimi came into the room, running hurriedly and breathing heavily.

Lilla rushed to her, and the two clasped hands.  With that, a new sense
of power, greater than Lilla had ever seen in her, seemed to quicken her
cousin.  Her hand swept the air in front of Edgar Caswall, seeming to
drive him backward more and more by each movement, till at last he seemed
to be actually hurled through the door which Mimi's entrance had left
open, and fell at full length on the gravel path without.

Then came the final and complete collapse of Lilla, who, without a sound,
sank down on the floor.




CHAPTER XXVI--FACE TO FACE


Mimi was greatly distressed when she saw her cousin lying prone.  She had
a few times in her life seen Lilla on the verge of fainting, but never
senseless; and now she was frightened.  She threw herself on her knees
beside Lilla, and tried, by rubbing her hands and other measures commonly
known, to restore her.  But all her efforts were unavailing.  Lilla still
lay white and senseless.  In fact, each moment she looked worse; her
breast, that had been heaving with the stress, became still, and the
pallor of her face grew like marble.

At these succeeding changes Mimi's fright grew, till it altogether
mastered her.  She succeeded in controlling herself only to the extent
that she did not scream.

Lady Arabella had followed Caswall, when he had recovered sufficiently to
get up and walk--though stumblingly--in the direction of Castra Regis.
When Mimi was quite alone with Lilla and the need for effort had ceased,
she felt weak and trembled.  In her own mind, she attributed it to a
sudden change in the weather--it was momentarily becoming apparent that a
storm was coming on.

She raised Lilla's head and laid it on her warm young breast, but all in
vain.  The cold of the white features thrilled through her, and she
utterly collapsed when it was borne in on her that Lilla had passed away.

The dusk gradually deepened and the shades of evening closed in, but Mimi
did not seem to notice or to care.  She sat on the floor with her arms
round the body of the girl whom she loved.  Darker and blacker grew the
sky as the coming storm and the closing night joined forces.  Still she
sat on--alone--tearless--unable to think.  Mimi did not know how long she
sat there.  Though it seemed to her that ages had passed, it could not
have been more than half-an-hour.  She suddenly came to herself, and was
surprised to find that her grandfather had not returned.  For a while she
lay quiet, thinking of the immediate past.  Lilla's hand was still in
hers, and to her surprise it was still warm.  Somehow this helped her
consciousness, and without any special act of will she stood up.  She lit
a lamp and looked at her cousin.  There was no doubt that Lilla was dead;
but when the lamp-light fell on her eyes, they seemed to look at Mimi
with intent--with meaning.  In this state of dark isolation a new
resolution came to her, and grew and grew until it became a fixed
definite purpose.  She would face Caswall and call him to account for his
murder of Lilla--that was what she called it to herself.  She would also
take steps--she knew not what or how--to avenge the part taken by Lady
Arabella.

In this frame of mind she lit all the lamps in the room, got water and
linen from her room, and set about the decent ordering of Lilla's body.
This took some time; but when it was finished, she put on her hat and
cloak, put out the lights, and set out quietly for Castra Regis.

As Mimi drew near the Castle, she saw no lights except those in and
around the tower room.  The lights showed her that Mr. Caswall was there,
so she entered by the hall door, which as usual was open, and felt her
way in the darkness up the staircase to the lobby of the room.  The door
was ajar, and the light from within showed brilliantly through the
opening.  She saw Edgar Caswall walking restlessly to and fro in the
room, with his hands clasped behind his back.  She opened the door
without knocking, and walked right into the room.  As she entered, he
ceased walking, and stared at her in surprise.  She made no remark, no
comment, but continued the fixed look which he had seen on her entrance.

For a time silence reigned, and the two stood looking fixedly at each
other.  Mimi was the first to speak.

"You murderer!  Lilla is dead!"

"Dead!  Good God!  When did she die?"

"She died this afternoon, just after you left her."

"Are you sure?"

"Yes--and so are you--or you ought to be.  You killed her!"

"I killed her!  Be careful what you say!"

"As God sees us, it is true; and you know it.  You came to Mercy Farm on
purpose to break her--if you could.  And the accomplice of your guilt,
Lady Arabella March, came for the same purpose."

"Be careful, woman," he said hotly.  "Do not use such names in that way,
or you shall suffer for it."

"I am suffering for it--have suffered for it--shall suffer for it.  Not
for speaking the truth as I have done, but because you two, with devilish
malignity, did my darling to death.  It is you and your accomplice who
have to dread punishment, not I."

"Take care!" he said again.

"Oh, I am not afraid of you or your accomplice," she answered spiritedly.
"I am content to stand by every word I have said, every act I have done.
Moreover, I believe in God's justice.  I fear not the grinding of His
mills; if necessary I shall set the wheels in motion myself.  But you
don't care for God, or believe in Him.  Your god is your great kite,
which cows the birds of a whole district.  But be sure that His hand,
when it rises, always falls at the appointed time.  It may be that your
name is being called even at this very moment at the Great Assize.  Repent
while there is still time.  Happy you, if you may be allowed to enter
those mighty halls in the company of the pure-souled angel whose voice
has only to whisper one word of justice, and you disappear for ever into
everlasting torment."

The sudden death of Lilla caused consternation among Mimi's friends and
well-wishers.  Such a tragedy was totally unexpected, as Adam and Sir
Nathaniel had been expecting the White Worm's vengeance to fall upon
themselves.

Adam, leaving his wife free to follow her own desires with regard to
Lilla and her grandfather, busied himself with filling the well-hole with
the fine sand prepared for the purpose, taking care to have lowered at
stated intervals quantities of the store of dynamite, so as to be ready
for the final explosion.  He had under his immediate supervision a corps
of workmen, and was assisted by Sir Nathaniel, who had come over for the
purpose, and all were now staying at Lesser Hill.

Mr. Salton, too, showed much interest in the job, and was constantly
coming in and out, nothing escaping his observation.

Since her marriage to Adam and their coming to stay at Doom Tower, Mimi
had been fettered by fear of the horrible monster at Diana's Grove.  But
now she dreaded it no longer.  She accepted the fact of its assuming at
will the form of Lady Arabella.  She had still to tax and upbraid her for
her part in the unhappiness which had been wrought on Lilla, and for her
share in causing her death.

One evening, when Mimi entered her own room, she went to the window and
threw an eager look round the whole circle of sight.  A single glance
satisfied her that the White Worm in _propria persona_ was not visible.
So she sat down in the window-seat and enjoyed the pleasure of a full
view, from which she had been so long cut off.  The maid who waited on
her had told her that Mr. Salton had not yet returned home, so she felt
free to enjoy the luxury of peace and quiet.

As she looked out of the window, she saw something thin and white move
along the avenue.  She thought she recognised the figure of Lady
Arabella, and instinctively drew back behind the curtain.  When she had
ascertained, by peeping out several times, that the lady had not seen
her, she watched more carefully, all her instinctive hatred flooding back
at the sight of her.  Lady Arabella was moving swiftly and stealthily,
looking back and around her at intervals, as if she feared to be
followed.  This gave Mimi an idea that she was up to no good, so she
determined to seize the occasion for watching her in more detail.

Hastily putting on a dark cloak and hat, she ran downstairs and out into
the avenue.  Lady Arabella had moved, but the sheen of her white dress
was still to be seen among the young oaks around the gateway.  Keeping in
shadow, Mimi followed, taking care not to come so close as to awake the
other's suspicion, and watched her quarry pass along the road in the
direction of Castra Regis.

She followed on steadily through the gloom of the trees, depending on the
glint of the white dress to keep her right.  The wood began to thicken,
and presently, when the road widened and the trees grew farther back, she
lost sight of any indication of her whereabouts.  Under the present
conditions it was impossible for her to do any more, so, after waiting
for a while, still hidden in the shadow to see if she could catch another
glimpse of the white frock, she determined to go on slowly towards Castra
Regis, and trust to the chapter of accidents to pick up the trail again.
She went on slowly, taking advantage of every obstacle and shadow to keep
herself concealed.

At last she entered on the grounds of the Castle, at a spot from which
the windows of the turret were dimly visible, without having seen again
any sign of Lady Arabella.

Meanwhile, during most of the time that Mimi Salton had been moving
warily along in the gloom, she was in reality being followed by Lady
Arabella, who had caught sight of her leaving the house and had never
again lost touch with her.  It was a case of the hunter being hunted.  For
a time Mimi's many turnings, with the natural obstacles that were
perpetually intervening, caused Lady Arabella some trouble; but when she
was close to Castra Regis, there was no more possibility of concealment,
and the strange double following went swiftly on.

When she saw Mimi close to the hall door of Castra Regis and ascending
the steps, she followed.  When Mimi entered the dark hall and felt her
way up the staircase, still, as she believed, following Lady Arabella,
the latter kept on her way.  When they reached the lobby of the turret-
rooms, Mimi believed that the object of her search was ahead of her.

Edgar Caswall sat in the gloom of the great room, occasionally stirred to
curiosity when the drifting clouds allowed a little light to fall from
the storm-swept sky.  But nothing really interested him now.  Since he
had heard of Lilla's death, the gloom of his remorse, emphasised by
Mimi's upbraiding, had made more hopeless his cruel, selfish, saturnine
nature.  He heard no sound, for his normal faculties seemed benumbed.

Mimi, when she came to the door, which stood ajar, gave a light tap.  So
light was it that it did not reach Caswall's ears.  Then, taking her
courage in both hands, she boldly pushed the door and entered.  As she
did so, her heart sank, for now she was face to face with a difficulty
which had not, in her state of mental perturbation, occurred to her.




CHAPTER XXVII--ON THE TURRET ROOF


The storm which was coming was already making itself manifest, not only
in the wide scope of nature, but in the hearts and natures of human
beings.  Electrical disturbance in the sky and the air is reproduced in
animals of all kinds, and particularly in the highest type of them
all--the most receptive--the most electrical.  So it was with Edgar
Caswall, despite his selfish nature and coldness of blood.  So it was
with Mimi Salton, despite her unselfish, unchanging devotion for those
she loved.  So it was even with Lady Arabella, who, under the instincts
of a primeval serpent, carried the ever-varying wishes and customs of
womanhood, which is always old--and always new.

Edgar, after he had turned his eyes on Mimi, resumed his apathetic
position and sullen silence.  Mimi quietly took a seat a little way
apart, whence she could look on the progress of the coming storm and
study its appearance throughout the whole visible circle of the
neighbourhood.  She was in brighter and better spirits than she had been
for many days past.  Lady Arabella tried to efface herself behind the now
open door.

Without, the clouds grew thicker and blacker as the storm-centre came
closer.  As yet the forces, from whose linking the lightning springs,
were held apart, and the silence of nature proclaimed the calm before the
storm.  Caswall felt the effect of the gathering electric force.  A sort
of wild exultation grew upon him, such as he had sometimes felt just
before the breaking of a tropical storm.  As he became conscious of this,
he raised his head and caught sight of Mimi.  He was in the grip of an
emotion greater than himself; in the mood in which he was he felt the
need upon him of doing some desperate deed.  He was now absolutely
reckless, and as Mimi was associated with him in the memory which drove
him on, he wished that she too should be engaged in this enterprise.  He
had no knowledge of the proximity of Lady Arabella, and thought that he
was far removed from all he knew and whose interests he shared--alone
with the wild elements, which were being lashed to fury, and with the
woman who had struggled with him and vanquished him, and on whom he would
shower the full measure of his hate.

The fact was that Edgar Caswall was, if not mad, close to the
border-line.  Madness in its first stage--monomania--is a lack of
proportion.  So long as this is general, it is not always noticeable, for
the uninspired onlooker is without the necessary means of comparison.  But
in monomania the errant faculty protrudes itself in a way that may not be
denied.  It puts aside, obscures, or takes the place of something
else--just as the head of a pin placed before the centre of the iris will
block out the whole scope of vision.  The most usual form of monomania
has commonly the same beginning as that from which Edgar Caswall
suffered--an over-large idea of self-importance.  Alienists, who study
the matter exactly, probably know more of human vanity and its effects
than do ordinary men.  Caswall's mental disturbance was not hard to
identify.  Every asylum is full of such cases--men and women, who,
naturally selfish and egotistical, so appraise to themselves their own
importance that every other circumstance in life becomes subservient to
it.  The disease supplies in itself the material for self-magnification.
When the decadence attacks a nature naturally proud and selfish and vain,
and lacking both the aptitude and habit of self-restraint, the
development of the disease is more swift, and ranges to farther limits.
It is such persons who become imbued with the idea that they have the
attributes of the Almighty--even that they themselves are the Almighty.

Mimi had a suspicion--or rather, perhaps, an intuition--of the true state
of things when she heard him speak, and at the same time noticed the
abnormal flush on his face, and his rolling eyes.  There was a certain
want of fixedness of purpose which she had certainly not noticed before--a
quick, spasmodic utterance which belongs rather to the insane than to
those of intellectual equilibrium.  She was a little frightened, not only
by his thoughts, but by his staccato way of expressing them.

Caswall moved to the door leading to the turret stair by which the roof
was reached, and spoke in a peremptory way, whose tone alone made her
feel defiant.

"Come!  I want you."

She instinctively drew back--she was not accustomed to such words, more
especially to such a tone.  Her answer was indicative of a new contest.

"Why should I go?  What for?"

He did not at once reply--another indication of his overwhelming egotism.
She repeated her questions; habit reasserted itself, and he spoke without
thinking the words which were in his heart.

"I want you, if you will be so good, to come with me to the turret roof.
I am much interested in certain experiments with the kite, which would
be, if not a pleasure, at least a novel experience to you.  You would see
something not easily seen otherwise."

"I will come," she answered simply; Edgar moved in the direction of the
stair, she following close behind him.

She did not like to be left alone at such a height, in such a place, in
the darkness, with a storm about to break.  Of himself she had no fear;
all that had been seemed to have passed away with her two victories over
him in the struggle of wills.  Moreover, the more recent
apprehension--that of his madness--had also ceased.  In the conversation
of the last few minutes he seemed so rational, so clear, so unaggressive,
that she no longer saw reason for doubt.  So satisfied was she that even
when he put out a hand to guide her to the steep, narrow stairway, she
took it without thought in the most conventional way.

Lady Arabella, crouching in the lobby behind the door, heard every word
that had been said, and formed her own opinion of it.  It seemed evident
to her that there had been some rapprochement between the two who had so
lately been hostile to each other, and that made her furiously angry.
Mimi was interfering with her plans!  She had made certain of her capture
of Edgar Caswall, and she could not tolerate even the lightest and most
contemptuous fancy on his part which might divert him from the main
issue.  When she became aware that he wished Mimi to come with him to the
roof and that she had acquiesced, her rage got beyond bounds.  She became
oblivious to any danger there might be in a visit to such an exposed
place at such a time, and to all lesser considerations, and made up her
mind to forestall them.  She stealthily and noiselessly crept through the
wicket, and, ascending the stair, stepped out on the roof.  It was
bitterly cold, for the fierce gusts of the storm which swept round the
turret drove in through every unimpeded way, whistling at the sharp
corners and singing round the trembling flagstaff.  The kite-string and
the wire which controlled the runners made a concourse of weird sounds
which somehow, perhaps from the violence which surrounded them, acting on
their length, resolved themselves into some kind of harmony--a fitting
accompaniment to the tragedy which seemed about to begin.

Mimi's heart beat heavily.  Just before leaving the turret-chamber she
had a shock which she could not shake off.  The lights of the room had
momentarily revealed to her, as they passed out, Edgar's face,
concentrated as it was whenever he intended to use his mesmeric power.
Now the black eyebrows made a thick line across his face, under which his
eyes shone and glittered ominously.  Mimi recognised the danger, and
assumed the defiant attitude that had twice already served her so well.
She had a fear that the circumstances and the place were against her, and
she wanted to be forearmed.

The sky was now somewhat lighter than it had been.  Either there was
lightning afar off, whose reflections were carried by the rolling clouds,
or else the gathered force, though not yet breaking into lightning, had
an incipient power of light.  It seemed to affect both the man and the
woman.  Edgar seemed altogether under its influence.  His spirits were
boisterous, his mind exalted.  He was now at his worst; madder than he
had been earlier in the night.

Mimi, trying to keep as far from him as possible, moved across the stone
floor of the turret roof, and found a niche which concealed her.  It was
not far from Lady Arabella's place of hiding.

Edgar, left thus alone on the centre of the turret roof, found himself
altogether his own master in a way which tended to increase his madness.
He knew that Mimi was close at hand, though he had lost sight of her.  He
spoke loudly, and the sound of his own voice, though it was carried from
him on the sweeping wind as fast as the words were spoken, seemed to
exalt him still more.  Even the raging of the elements round him appeared
to add to his exaltation.  To him it seemed that these manifestations
were obedient to his own will.  He had reached the sublime of his
madness; he was now in his own mind actually the Almighty, and whatever
might happen would be the direct carrying out of his own commands.  As he
could not see Mimi, nor fix whereabout she was, he shouted loudly:

"Come to me!  You shall see now what you are despising, what you are
warring against.  All that you see is mine--the darkness as well as the
light.  I tell you that I am greater than any other who is, or was, or
shall be.  When the Master of Evil took Christ up on a high place and
showed Him all the kingdoms of the earth, he was doing what he thought no
other could do.  He was wrong--he forgot _Me_.  I shall send you light,
up to the very ramparts of heaven.  A light so great that it shall
dissipate those black clouds that are rushing up and piling around us.
Look!  Look!  At the very touch of my hand that light springs into being
and mounts up--and up--and up!"

He made his way whilst he was speaking to the corner of the turret whence
flew the giant kite, and from which the runners ascended.  Mimi looked
on, appalled and afraid to speak lest she should precipitate some
calamity.  Within the niche Lady Arabella cowered in a paroxysm of fear.

Edgar took up a small wooden box, through a hole in which the wire of the
runner ran.  This evidently set some machinery in motion, for a sound as
of whirring came.  From one side of the box floated what looked like a
piece of stiff ribbon, which snapped and crackled as the wind took it.
For a few seconds Mimi saw it as it rushed along the sagging line to the
kite.  When close to it, there was a loud crack, and a sudden light
appeared to issue from every chink in the box.  Then a quick flame
flashed along the snapping ribbon, which glowed with an intense light--a
light so great that the whole of the countryside around stood out against
the background of black driving clouds.  For a few seconds the light
remained, then suddenly disappeared in the blackness around.  It was
simply a magnesium light, which had been fired by the mechanism within
the box and carried up to the kite.  Edgar was in a state of tumultuous
excitement, shouting and yelling at the top of his voice and dancing
about like a lunatic.

This was more than Lady Arabella's curious dual nature could stand--the
ghoulish element in her rose triumphant, and she abandoned all idea of
marriage with Edgar Caswall, gloating fiendishly over the thought of
revenge.

She must lure him to the White Worm's hole--but how?  She glanced around
and quickly made up her mind.  The man's whole thoughts were absorbed by
his wonderful kite, which he was showing off, in order to fascinate her
imaginary rival, Mimi.

On the instant she glided through the darkness to the wheel whereon the
string of the kite was wound.  With deft fingers she unshipped this, took
it with her, reeling out the wire as she went, thus keeping, in a way, in
touch with the kite.  Then she glided swiftly to the wicket, through
which she passed, locking the gate behind her as she went.

Down the turret stair she ran quickly, letting the wire run from the
wheel which she carried carefully, and, passing out of the hall door,
hurried down the avenue with all her speed.  She soon reached her own
gate, ran down the avenue, and with her key opened the iron door leading
to the well-hole.

She felt well satisfied with herself.  All her plans were maturing, or
had already matured.  The Master of Castra Regis was within her grasp.
The woman whose interference she had feared, Lilla Watford, was dead.
Truly, all was well, and she felt that she might pause a while and rest.
She tore off her clothes, with feverish fingers, and in full enjoyment of
her natural freedom, stretched her slim figure in animal delight.  Then
she lay down on the sofa--to await her victim!  Edgar Caswall's life
blood would more than satisfy her for some time to come.




CHAPTER XXVIII--THE BREAKING OF THE STORM


When Lady Arabella had crept away in her usual noiseless fashion, the two
others remained for a while in their places on the turret roof: Caswall
because he had nothing to say, Mimi because she had much to say and
wished to put her thoughts in order.  For quite a while--which seemed
interminable--silence reigned between them.  At last Mimi made a
beginning--she had made up her mind how to act.

"Mr. Caswall," she said loudly, so as to make sure of being heard through
the blustering of the wind and the perpetual cracking of the electricity.

Caswall said something in reply, but his words were carried away on the
storm.  However, one of her objects was effected: she knew now exactly
whereabout on the roof he was.  So she moved close to the spot before she
spoke again, raising her voice almost to a shout.

"The wicket is shut.  Please to open it.  I can't get out."

As she spoke, she was quietly fingering a revolver which Adam had given
to her in case of emergency and which now lay in her breast.  She felt
that she was caged like a rat in a trap, but did not mean to be taken at
a disadvantage, whatever happened.  Caswall also felt trapped, and all
the brute in him rose to the emergency.  In a voice which was raucous and
brutal--much like that which is heard when a wife is being beaten by her
husband in a slum--he hissed out, his syllables cutting through the
roaring of the storm:

"You came of your own accord--without permission, or even asking it.  Now
you can stay or go as you choose.  But you must manage it for yourself;
I'll have nothing to do with it."

Her answer was spoken with dangerous suavity

"I am going.  Blame yourself if you do not like the time and manner of
it.  I daresay Adam--my husband--will have a word to say to you about
it!"

"Let him say, and be damned to him, and to you too!  I'll show you a
light.  You shan't be able to say that you could not see what you were
doing."

As he spoke, he was lighting another piece of the magnesium ribbon, which
made a blinding glare in which everything was plainly discernible, down
to the smallest detail.  This exactly suited Mimi.  She took accurate
note of the wicket and its fastening before the glare had died away.  She
took her revolver out and fired into the lock, which was shivered on the
instant, the pieces flying round in all directions, but happily without
causing hurt to anyone.  Then she pushed the wicket open and ran down the
narrow stair, and so to the hall door.  Opening this also, she ran down
the avenue, never lessening her speed till she stood outside the door of
Lesser Hill.  The door was opened at once on her ringing.

"Is Mr. Adam Salton in?" she asked.

"He has just come in, a few minutes ago.  He has gone up to the study,"
replied a servant.

She ran upstairs at once and joined him.  He seemed relieved when he saw
her, but scrutinised her face keenly.  He saw that she had been in some
concern, so led her over to the sofa in the window and sat down beside
her.

"Now, dear, tell me all about it!" he said.

She rushed breathlessly through all the details of her adventure on the
turret roof.  Adam listened attentively, helping her all he could, and
not embarrassing her by any questioning.  His thoughtful silence was a
great help to her, for it allowed her to collect and organise her
thoughts.

"I must go and see Caswall to-morrow, to hear what he has to say on the
subject."

"But, dear, for my sake, don't have any quarrel with Mr. Caswall.  I have
had too much trial and pain lately to wish it increased by any anxiety
regarding you."

"You shall not, dear--if I can help it--please God," he said solemnly,
and he kissed her.

Then, in order to keep her interested so that she might forget the fears
and anxieties that had disturbed her, he began to talk over the details
of her adventure, making shrewd comments which attracted and held her
attention.  Presently, _inter alia_, he said:

"That's a dangerous game Caswall is up to.  It seems to me that that
young man--though he doesn't appear to know it--is riding for a fall!"

"How, dear?  I don't understand."

"Kite flying on a night like this from a place like the tower of Castra
Regis is, to say the least of it, dangerous.  It is not merely courting
death or other accident from lightning, but it is bringing the lightning
into where he lives.  Every cloud that is blowing up here--and they all
make for the highest point--is bound to develop into a flash of
lightning.  That kite is up in the air and is bound to attract the
lightning.  Its cord makes a road for it on which to travel to earth.
When it does come, it will strike the top of the tower with a weight a
hundred times greater than a whole park of artillery, and will knock
Castra Regis into pieces.  Where it will go after that, no one can tell.
If there should be any metal by which it can travel, such will not only
point the road, but be the road itself."

"Would it be dangerous to be out in the open air when such a thing is
taking place?" she asked.

"No, little woman.  It would be the safest possible place--so long as one
was not in the line of the electric current."

"Then, do let us go outside.  I don't want to run into any foolish
danger--or, far more, to ask you to do so.  But surely if the open is
safest, that is the place for us."

Without another word, she put on again the cloak she had thrown off, and
a small, tight-fitting cap.  Adam too put on his cap, and, after seeing
that his revolver was all right, gave her his hand, and they left the
house together.

"I think the best thing we can do will be to go round all the places
which are mixed up in this affair."

"All right, dear, I am ready.  But, if you don't mind, we might go first
to Mercy.  I am anxious about grandfather, and we might see that--as yet,
at all events--nothing has happened there."

So they went on the high-hung road along the top of the Brow.  The wind
here was of great force, and made a strange booming noise as it swept
high overhead; though not the sound of cracking and tearing as it passed
through the woods of high slender trees which grew on either side of the
road.  Mimi could hardly keep her feet.  She was not afraid; but the
force to which she was opposed gave her a good excuse to hold on to her
husband extra tight.

At Mercy there was no one up--at least, all the lights were out.  But to
Mimi, accustomed to the nightly routine of the house, there were manifest
signs that all was well, except in the little room on the first floor,
where the blinds were down.  Mimi could not bear to look at that, to
think of it.  Adam understood her pain, for he had been keenly interested
in poor Lilla.  He bent over and kissed her, and then took her hand and
held it hard.  Thus they passed on together, returning to the high road
towards Castra Regis.

At the gate of Castra Regis they were extra careful.  When drawing near,
Adam stumbled upon the wire that Lady Arabella had left trailing on the
ground.

Adam drew his breath at this, and spoke in a low, earnest whisper:

"I don't want to frighten you, Mimi dear, but wherever that wire is there
is danger."

"Danger!  How?"

"That is the track where the lightning will go; at any moment, even now
whilst we are speaking and searching, a fearful force may be loosed upon
us.  Run on, dear; you know the way to where the avenue joins the
highroad.  If you see any sign of the wire, keep away from it, for God's
sake.  I shall join you at the gateway."

"Are you going to follow that wire alone?"

"Yes, dear.  One is sufficient for that work.  I shall not lose a moment
till I am with you."

"Adam, when I came with you into the open, my main wish was that we
should be together if anything serious happened.  You wouldn't deny me
that right, would you, dear?"

"No, dear, not that or any right.  Thank God that my wife has such a
wish.  Come; we will go together.  We are in the hands of God.  If He
wishes, we shall be together at the end, whenever or wherever that may
be."

They picked up the trail of the wire on the steps and followed it down
the avenue, taking care not to touch it with their feet.  It was easy
enough to follow, for the wire, if not bright, was self-coloured, and
showed clearly.  They followed it out of the gateway and into the avenue
of Diana's Grove.

Here a new gravity clouded Adam's face, though Mimi saw no cause for
fresh concern.  This was easily enough explained.  Adam knew of the
explosive works in progress regarding the well-hole, but the matter had
been kept from his wife.  As they stood near the house, Adam asked Mimi
to return to the road, ostensibly to watch the course of the wire,
telling her that there might be a branch wire leading somewhere else.  She
was to search the undergrowth, and if she found it, was to warn him by
the Australian native "Coo-ee!"

Whilst they were standing together, there came a blinding flash of
lightning, which lit up for several seconds the whole area of earth and
sky.  It was only the first note of the celestial prelude, for it was
followed in quick succession by numerous flashes, whilst the crash and
roll of thunder seemed continuous.

Adam, appalled, drew his wife to him and held her close.  As far as he
could estimate by the interval between lightning and thunder-clap, the
heart of the storm was still some distance off, so he felt no present
concern for their safety.  Still, it was apparent that the course of the
storm was moving swiftly in their direction.  The lightning flashes came
faster and faster and closer together; the thunder-roll was almost
continuous, not stopping for a moment--a new crash beginning before the
old one had ceased.  Adam kept looking up in the direction where the kite
strained and struggled at its detaining cord, but, of course, the dull
evening light prevented any distinct scrutiny.

At length there came a flash so appallingly bright that in its glare
Nature seemed to be standing still.  So long did it last, that there was
time to distinguish its configuration.  It seemed like a mighty tree
inverted, pendent from the sky.  The whole country around within the
angle of vision was lit up till it seemed to glow.  Then a broad ribbon
of fire seemed to drop on to the tower of Castra Regis just as the
thunder crashed.  By the glare, Adam could see the tower shake and
tremble, and finally fall to pieces like a house of cards.  The passing
of the lightning left the sky again dark, but a blue flame fell downward
from the tower, and, with inconceivable rapidity, running along the
ground in the direction of Diana's Grove, reached the dark silent house,
which in the instant burst into flame at a hundred different points.

At the same moment there rose from the house a rending, crashing sound of
woodwork, broken or thrown about, mixed with a quick scream so appalling
that Adam, stout of heart as he undoubtedly was, felt his blood turn into
ice.  Instinctively, despite the danger and their consciousness of it,
husband and wife took hands and listened, trembling.  Something was going
on close to them, mysterious, terrible, deadly!  The shrieks continued,
though less sharp in sound, as though muffled.  In the midst of them was
a terrific explosion, seemingly from deep in the earth.

The flames from Castra Regis and from Diana's Grove made all around
almost as light as day, and now that the lightning had ceased to flash,
their eyes, unblinded, were able to judge both perspective and detail.
The heat of the burning house caused the iron doors to warp and collapse.
Seemingly of their own accord, they fell open, and exposed the interior.
The Saltons could now look through to the room beyond, where the well-
hole yawned, a deep narrow circular chasm.  From this the agonised
shrieks were rising, growing ever more terrible with each second that
passed.

But it was not only the heart-rending sound that almost paralysed poor
Mimi with terror.  What she saw was sufficient to fill her with evil
dreams for the remainder of her life.  The whole place looked as if a sea
of blood had been beating against it.  Each of the explosions from below
had thrown out from the well-hole, as if it had been the mouth of a
cannon, a mass of fine sand mixed with blood, and a horrible repulsive
slime in which were great red masses of rent and torn flesh and fat.  As
the explosions kept on, more and more of this repulsive mass was shot up,
the great bulk of it falling back again.  Many of the awful fragments
were of something which had lately been alive.  They quivered and
trembled and writhed as though they were still in torment, a supposition
to which the unending scream gave a horrible credence.  At moments some
mountainous mass of flesh surged up through the narrow orifice, as though
forced by a measureless power through an opening infinitely smaller than
itself.  Some of these fragments were partially covered with white skin
as of a human being, and others--the largest and most numerous--with
scaled skin as of a gigantic lizard or serpent.  Once, in a sort of lull
or pause, the seething contents of the hole rose, after the manner of a
bubbling spring, and Adam saw part of the thin form of Lady Arabella,
forced up to the top amid a mass of blood and slime, and what looked as
if it had been the entrails of a monster torn into shreds.  Several times
some masses of enormous bulk were forced up through the well-hole with
inconceivable violence, and, suddenly expanding as they came into larger
space, disclosed sections of the White Worm which Adam and Sir Nathaniel
had seen looking over the trees with its enormous eyes of emerald-green
flickering like great lamps in a gale.

At last the explosive power, which was not yet exhausted, evidently
reached the main store of dynamite which had been lowered into the worm
hole.  The result was appalling.  The ground for far around quivered and
opened in long deep chasms, whose edges shook and fell in, throwing up
clouds of sand which fell back and hissed amongst the rising water.  The
heavily built house shook to its foundations.  Great stones were thrown
up as from a volcano, some of them, great masses of hard stone, squared
and grooved with implements wrought by human hands, breaking up and
splitting in mid air as though riven by some infernal power.  Trees near
the house--and therefore presumably in some way above the hole, which
sent up clouds of dust and steam and fine sand mingled, and which carried
an appalling stench which sickened the spectators--were torn up by the
roots and hurled into the air.  By now, flames were bursting violently
from all over the ruins, so dangerously that Adam caught up his wife in
his arms, and ran with her from the proximity of the flames.

Then almost as quickly as it had begun, the whole cataclysm ceased,
though a deep-down rumbling continued intermittently for some time.  Then
silence brooded over all--silence so complete that it seemed in itself a
sentient thing--silence which seemed like incarnate darkness, and
conveyed the same idea to all who came within its radius.  To the young
people who had suffered the long horror of that awful night, it brought
relief--relief from the presence or the fear of all that was
horrible--relief which seemed perfected when the red rays of sunrise shot
up over the far eastern sea, bringing a promise of a new order of things
with the coming day.

* * * * *

His bed saw little of Adam Salton for the remainder of that night.  He
and Mimi walked hand in hand in the brightening dawn round by the Brow to
Castra Regis and on to Lesser Hill.  They did so deliberately, in an
attempt to think as little as possible of the terrible experiences of the
night.  The morning was bright and cheerful, as a morning sometimes is
after a devastating storm.  The clouds, of which there were plenty in
evidence, brought no lingering idea of gloom.  All nature was bright and
joyous, being in striking contrast to the scenes of wreck and
devastation, the effects of obliterating fire and lasting ruin.

The only evidence of the once stately pile of Castra Regis and its
inhabitants was a shapeless huddle of shattered architecture, dimly seen
as the keen breeze swept aside the cloud of acrid smoke which marked the
site of the once lordly castle.  As for Diana's Grove, they looked in
vain for a sign which had a suggestion of permanence.  The oak trees of
the Grove were still to be seen--some of them--emerging from a haze of
smoke, the great trunks solid and erect as ever, but the larger branches
broken and twisted and rent, with bark stripped and chipped, and the
smaller branches broken and dishevelled looking from the constant stress
and threshing of the storm.

Of the house as such, there was, even at the short distance from which
they looked, no trace.  Adam resolutely turned his back on the
devastation and hurried on.  Mimi was not only upset and shocked in many
ways, but she was physically "dog tired," and falling asleep on her feet.
Adam took her to her room and made her undress and get into bed, taking
care that the room was well lighted both by sunshine and lamps.  The only
obstruction was from a silk curtain, drawn across the window to keep out
the glare.  He sat beside her, holding her hand, well knowing that the
comfort of his presence was the best restorative for her.  He stayed with
her till sleep had overmastered her wearied body.  Then he went softly
away.  He found his uncle and Sir Nathaniel in the study, having an early
cup of tea, amplified to the dimensions of a possible breakfast.  Adam
explained that he had not told his wife that he was going over the
horrible places again, lest it should frighten her, for the rest and
sleep in ignorance would help her and make a gap of peacefulness between
the horrors.

Sir Nathaniel agreed.

"We know, my boy," he said, "that the unfortunate Lady Arabella is dead,
and that the foul carcase of the Worm has been torn to pieces--pray God
that its evil soul will never more escape from the nethermost hell."

They visited Diana's Grove first, not only because it was nearer, but
also because it was the place where most description was required, and
Adam felt that he could tell his story best on the spot.  The absolute
destruction of the place and everything in it seen in the broad daylight
was almost inconceivable.  To Sir Nathaniel, it was as a story of horror
full and complete.  But to Adam it was, as it were, only on the fringes.
He knew what was still to be seen when his friends had got over the
knowledge of externals.  As yet, they had only seen the outside of the
house--or rather, where the outside of the house once had been.  The
great horror lay within.  However, age--and the experience of age--counts.

A strange, almost elemental, change in the aspect had taken place in the
time which had elapsed since the dawn.  It would almost seem as if Nature
herself had tried to obliterate the evil signs of what had occurred.
True, the utter ruin of the house was made even more manifest in the
searching daylight; but the more appalling destruction which lay beneath
was not visible.  The rent, torn, and dislocated stonework looked worse
than before; the upheaved foundations, the piled-up fragments of masonry,
the fissures in the torn earth--all were at the worst.  The Worm's hole
was still evident, a round fissure seemingly leading down into the very
bowels of the earth.  But all the horrid mass of blood and slime, of
torn, evil-smelling flesh and the sickening remnants of violent death,
were gone.  Either some of the later explosions had thrown up from the
deep quantities of water which, though foul and corrupt itself, had still
some cleansing power left, or else the writhing mass which stirred from
far below had helped to drag down and obliterate the items of horror.  A
grey dust, partly of fine sand, partly of the waste of the falling ruin,
covered everything, and, though ghastly itself, helped to mask something
still worse.

After a few minutes of watching, it became apparent to the three men that
the turmoil far below had not yet ceased.  At short irregular intervals
the hell-broth in the hole seemed as if boiling up.  It rose and fell
again and turned over, showing in fresh form much of the nauseous detail
which had been visible earlier.  The worst parts were the great masses of
the flesh of the monstrous Worm, in all its red and sickening aspect.
Such fragments had been bad enough before, but now they were infinitely
worse.  Corruption comes with startling rapidity to beings whose
destruction has been due wholly or in part to lightning--the whole mass
seemed to have become all at once corrupt!  The whole surface of the
fragments, once alive, was covered with insects, worms, and vermin of all
kinds.  The sight was horrible enough, but, with the awful smell added,
was simply unbearable.  The Worm's hole appeared to breathe forth death
in its most repulsive forms.  The friends, with one impulse, moved to the
top of the Brow, where a fresh breeze from the sea was blowing up.

At the top of the Brow, beneath them as they looked down, they saw a
shining mass of white, which looked strangely out of place amongst such
wreckage as they had been viewing.  It appeared so strange that Adam
suggested trying to find a way down, so that they might see it more
closely.

"We need not go down; I know what it is," Sir Nathaniel said.  "The
explosions of last night have blown off the outside of the cliffs--that
which we see is the vast bed of china clay through which the Worm
originally found its way down to its lair.  I can catch the glint of the
water of the deep quags far down below.  Well, her ladyship didn't
deserve such a funeral--or such a monument."

* * * * *

The horrors of the last few hours had played such havoc with Mimi's
nerves, that a change of scene was imperative--if a permanent breakdown
was to be avoided.

"I think," said old Mr. Salton, "it is quite time you young people
departed for that honeymoon of yours!"  There was a twinkle in his eye as
he spoke.

Mimi's soft shy glance at her stalwart husband, was sufficient answer.


Chapter I

A Summons in the Night


It all seemed so real that I could hardly imagine that it had ever
occurred before; and yet each episode came, not as a fresh step in the
logic of things, but as something expected.  It is in such a wise that
memory plays its pranks for good or ill; for pleasure or pain; for weal
or woe.  It is thus that life is bittersweet, and that which has been
done becomes eternal.

Again, the light skiff, ceasing to shoot through the lazy water as when
the oars flashed and dripped, glided out of the fierce July sunlight
into the cool shade of the great drooping willow branches--I standing
up in the swaying boat, she sitting still and with deft fingers
guarding herself from stray twigs or the freedom of the resilience of
moving boughs.  Again, the water looked golden-brown under the canopy
of translucent green; and the grassy bank was of emerald hue.  Again,
we sat in the cool shade, with the myriad noises of nature both without
and within our bower merging into that drowsy hum in whose sufficing
environment the great world with its disturbing trouble, and its more
disturbing joys, can be effectually forgotten.  Again, in that blissful
solitude the young girl lost the convention of her prim, narrow
upbringing, and told me in a natural, dreamy way of the loneliness of
her new life. With an undertone of sadness she made me feel how in that
spacious home each one of the household was isolated by the personal
magnificence of her father and herself; that there confidence had no
altar, and sympathy no shrine; and that there even her father's face
was as distant as the old country life seemed now.  Once more, the
wisdom of my manhood and the experience of my years laid themselves at
the girl's feet.  It was seemingly their own doing; for the individual
"I" had no say in the matter, but only just obeyed imperative orders.
And once again the flying seconds multiplied themselves endlessly.  For
it is in the arcana of dreams that existences merge and renew
themselves, change and yet keep the same--like the soul of a musician
in a fugue.  And so memory swooned, again and again, in sleep.

It seems that there is never to be any perfect rest.  Even in Eden the
snake rears its head among the laden boughs of the Tree of Knowledge.
The silence of the dreamless night is broken by the roar of the
avalanche; the hissing of sudden floods; the clanging of the engine
bell marking its sweep through a sleeping American town; the clanking
of distant paddles over the sea....  Whatever it is, it is breaking the
charm of my Eden.  The canopy of greenery above us, starred with
diamond-points of light, seems to quiver in the ceaseless beat of
paddles; and the restless bell seems as though it would never cease....

All at once the gates of Sleep were thrown wide open, and my waking
ears took in the cause of the disturbing sounds.  Waking existence is
prosaic enough--there was somebody knocking and ringing at someone's
street door.

I was pretty well accustomed in my Jermyn Street chambers to passing
sounds; usually I did not concern myself, sleeping or waking, with the
doings, however noisy, of my neighbours.  But this noise was too
continuous, too insistent, too imperative to be ignored.  There was
some active intelligence behind that ceaseless sound; and some stress
or need behind the intelligence.  I was not altogether selfish, and at
the thought of someone's need I was, without premeditation, out of bed.
Instinctively I looked at my watch.  It was just three o'clock; there
was a faint edging of grey round the green blind which darkened my
room. It was evident that the knocking and ringing were at the door of
our own house; and it was evident, too, that there was no one awake to
answer the call.  I slipped on my dressing-gown and slippers, and went
down to the hall door. When I opened it there stood a dapper groom,
with one hand pressed unflinchingly on the electric bell whilst with
the other he raised a ceaseless clangour with the knocker.  The instant
he saw me the noise ceased; one hand went up instinctively to the brim
of his hat, and the other produced a letter from his pocket.  A neat
brougham was opposite the door, the horses were breathing heavily as
though they had come fast.  A policeman, with his night lantern still
alight at his belt, stood by, attracted to the spot by the noise.

"Beg pardon, sir, I'm sorry for disturbing you, but my orders was
imperative; I was not to lose a moment, but to knock and ring till
someone came.  May I ask you, sir, if Mr. Malcolm Ross lives here?"

"I am Mr. Malcolm Ross."

"Then this letter is for you, sir, and the bro'am is for you too, sir!"

I took, with a strange curiosity, the letter which he handed to me.  As
a barrister I had had, of course, odd experiences now and then,
including sudden demands upon my time; but never anything like this.  I
stepped back into the hall, closing the door to, but leaving it ajar;
then I switched on the electric light.  The letter was directed in a
strange hand, a woman's.  It began at once without "dear sir" or any
such address:

"You said you would like to help me if I needed it; and I believe you
meant what you said.  The time has come sooner than I expected.  I am
in dreadful trouble, and do not know where to turn, or to whom to
apply. An attempt has, I fear, been made to murder my Father; though,
thank God, he still lives.  But he is quite unconscious. The doctors
and police have been sent for; but there is no one here whom I can
depend on.  Come at once if you are able to; and forgive me if you can.
I suppose I shall realise later what I have done in asking such a
favour; but at present I cannot think.  Come!  Come at once! MARGARET
TRELAWNY."

Pain and exultation struggled in my mind as I read; but the mastering
thought was that she was in trouble and had called on me--me!  My
dreaming of her, then, was not altogether without a cause.  I called
out to the groom:

"Wait!  I shall be with you in a minute!"  Then I flew upstairs.

A very few minutes sufficed to wash and dress; and we were soon driving
through the streets as fast as the horses could go.  It was market
morning, and when we got out on Piccadilly there was an endless stream
of carts coming from the west; but for the rest the roadway was clear,
and we went quickly.  I had told the groom to come into the brougham
with me so that he could tell me what had happened as we went along.
He sat awkwardly, with his hat on his knees as he spoke.

"Miss Trelawny, sir, sent a man to tell us to get out a carriage at
once; and when we was ready she come herself and gave me the letter and
told Morgan--the coachman, sir--to fly.  She said as I was to lose not
a second, but to keep knocking till someone come."

"Yes, I know, I know--you told me!  What I want to know is, why she
sent for me. What happened in the house?"

"I don't quite know myself, sir; except that master was found in his
room senseless, with the sheets all bloody, and a wound on his head. He
couldn't be waked nohow. Twas Miss Trelawny herself as found him."

"How did she come to find him at such an hour?  It was late in the
night, I suppose?"

"I don't know, sir; I didn't hear nothing at all of the details."

As he could tell me no more, I stopped the carriage for a moment to let
him get out on the box; then I turned the matter over in my mind as I
sat alone.  There were many things which I could have asked the
servant; and for a few moments after he had gone I was angry with
myself for not having used my opportunity.  On second thought, however,
I was glad the temptation was gone.  I felt that it would be more
delicate to learn what I wanted to know of Miss Trelawny's surroundings
from herself, rather than from her servants.

We bowled swiftly along Knightsbridge, the small noise of our
well-appointed vehicle sounding hollowly in the morning air.  We turned
up the Kensington Palace Road and presently stopped opposite a great
house on the left-hand side, nearer, so far as I could judge, the
Notting Hill than the Kensington end of the avenue.  It was a truly
fine house, not only with regard to size but to architecture.  Even in
the dim grey light of the morning, which tends to diminish the size of
things, it looked big.

Miss Trelawny met me in the hall.  She was not in any way shy.  She
seemed to rule all around her with a sort of high-bred dominance, all
the more remarkable as she was greatly agitated and as pale as snow.
In the great hall were several servants, the men standing together near
the hall door, and the women clinging together in the further corners
and doorways.  A police superintendent had been talking to Miss
Trelawny; two  men in uniform and one plain-clothes man stood near him.
As she took my hand impulsively there was a look of relief in her eyes,
and she gave a gentle sigh of relief.  Her salutation was simple.

"I knew you would come!"

The clasp of the hand can mean a great deal, even when it is not
intended to mean anything especially.  Miss Trelawny's hand somehow
became lost in my own.  It was not that it was a small hand; it was
fine and flexible, with long delicate fingers--a rare and beautiful
hand; it was the unconscious self-surrender.  And though at the moment
I could not dwell on the cause of the thrill which swept me, it came
back to me later.

She turned and said to the police superintendent:

"This is Mr. Malcolm Ross."  The police officer saluted as he answered:

"I know Mr. Malcolm Ross, miss.  Perhaps he will remember I had the
honour of working with him in the Brixton Coining case."  I had not at
first glance noticed who it was, my whole attention having been taken
with Miss Trelawny.

"Of course, Superintendent Dolan, I remember very well!" I said as we
shook hands. I could not but note that the acquaintanceship seemed a
relief to Miss Trelawny. There was a certain vague uneasiness in her
manner which took my attention; instinctively I felt that it would be
less embarrassing for her to speak with me alone. So I said to the
Superintendent:

"Perhaps it will be better if Miss Trelawny will see me alone for a few
minutes.  You, of course, have already heard all she knows; and I shall
understand better how things are if I may ask some questions.  I will
then talk the matter over with you if I may."

"I shall be glad to be of what service I can, sir," he answered
heartily.

Following Miss Trelawny, I moved over to a dainty room which opened
from the hall and looked out on the garden at the back of the house.
When we had entered and I had closed the door she said:

"I will thank you later for your goodness in coming to me in my
trouble; but at present you can best help me when you know the facts."

"Go on," I said.  "Tell me all you know and spare no detail, however
trivial it may at the present time seem to be."  She went on at once:

"I was awakened by some sound; I do not know what.  I only know that it
came through my sleep; for all at once I found myself awake, with my
heart beating wildly, listening anxiously for some sound from my
Father's room.  My room is next Father's, and I can often hear him
moving about before I fall asleep.  He works late at night, sometimes
very late indeed; so that when I wake early, as I do occasionally, or
in the grey of the dawn, I hear him still moving.  I tried once to
remonstrate with him about staying up so late, as it cannot be good for
him; but I never ventured to repeat the experiment.  You know how stern
and cold he can be--at least you may remember what I told you about
him; and when he is polite in this mood he is dreadful.  When he is
angry I can bear it much better; but when he is slow and deliberate,
and the side of his mouth lifts up to show the sharp teeth, I think I
feel--well, I don't know how!  Last night I got up softly and stole to
the door, for I really feared to disturb him.  There was not any noise
of moving, and no kind of cry at all; but there was a queer kind of
dragging sound, and a slow, heavy breathing. Oh! it was dreadful,
waiting there in the dark and the silence, and fearing--fearing I did
not know what!

"At last I took my courage a deux mains, and turning the handle as
softly as I could, I opened the door a tiny bit.  It was quite dark
within; I could just see the outline of the windows.  But in the
darkness the sound of breathing, becoming more distinct, was appalling.
As I listened, this continued; but there was no other sound.  I pushed
the door open all at once.  I was afraid to open it slowly; I felt as
if there might be some dreadful thing behind it ready to pounce out on
me! Then I switched on the electric light, and stepped into the room.
I looked first at the bed.  The sheets were all crumpled up, so that I
knew Father had been in bed; but there was a great dark red patch in
the centre of the bed, and spreading to the edge of it, that made my
heart stand still.  As I was gazing at it the sound of the breathing
came across the room, and my eyes followed to it.  There was Father on
his right side with the other arm under him, just as if his dead body
had been thrown there all in a heap.  The track of blood went across
the room up to the bed, and there was a pool all around him which
looked terribly red and glittering as I bent over to examine him.  The
place where he lay was right in front of the big safe.  He was in his
pyjamas. The left sleeve was torn, showing his bare arm, and stretched
out toward the safe.  It looked--oh! so terrible, patched all with
blood, and with the flesh torn or cut all around a gold chain bangle on
his wrist.  I did not know he wore such a thing, and it seemed to give
me a new shock of surprise."

She paused a moment; and as I wished to relieve her by a moment's
divergence of thought, I said:

"Oh, that need not surprise you.  You will see the most unlikely men
wearing bangles.  I have seen a judge condemn a man to death, and the
wrist of the hand he held up had a gold bangle."  She did not seem to
heed much the words or the idea; the pause, however, relieved her
somewhat, and she went on in a steadier voice:

"I did not lose a moment in summoning aid, for I feared he might bleed
to death.  I rang the bell, and then went out and called for help as
loudly as I could.  In what must have been a very short time--though it
seemed an incredibly long one to me--some of the servants came running
up; and then others, till the room seemed full of staring eyes, and
dishevelled hair, and night clothes of all sorts.

"We lifted Father on a sofa; and the housekeeper, Mrs. Grant, who
seemed to have her wits about her more than any of us, began to look
where the flow of blood came from.  In a few seconds it became apparent
that it came from the arm which was bare.  There was a deep wound--not
clean-cut as with a knife, but like a jagged rent or tear--close to the
wrist, which seemed to have cut into the vein.  Mrs. Grant tied a
handkerchief round the cut, and screwed it up tight with a silver
paper-cutter; and the flow of blood seemed to be checked at once.  By
this time I had come to my senses--or such of them as remained; and I
sent off one man for the doctor and another for the police.  When they
had gone, I felt that, except for the servants, I was all alone in the
house, and that I knew nothing--of my Father or anything else; and a
great longing came to me to have someone with me who could help me.
Then I thought of you and your kind offer in the boat under the
willow-tree; and, without waiting to think, I told the men to get a
carriage ready at once, and I scribbled a note and sent it on to you."

She paused.  I did not like to say just then anything of how I felt.  I
looked at her; I think she understood, for her eyes were raised to mine
for a moment and then fell, leaving her cheeks as red as peony roses.
With a manifest effort she went on with her story:

"The Doctor was with us in an incredibly short time.  The groom had met
him letting himself into his house with his latchkey, and he came here
running.  He made a proper tourniquet for poor Father's arm, and then
went home to get some appliances.  I dare say he will be back almost
immediately.  Then a policeman came, and sent a message to the station;
and very soon the Superintendent was here.  Then you came."

There was a long pause, and I ventured to take her hand for an instant.
Without a word more we opened the door, and joined the Superintendent
in the hall.  He hurried up to us, saying as he came:

"I have been examining everything myself, and have sent off a message
to Scotland Yard.  You see, Mr. Ross, there seemed so much that was odd
about the case that I thought we had better have the best man of the
Criminal Investigation Department that we could get.  So I sent a note
asking to have Sergeant Daw sent at once.  You remember him, sir, in
that American poisoning case at Hoxton."

"Oh yes," I said, "I remember him well; in that and other cases, for I
have benefited several times by his skill and acumen.  He has a mind
that works as truly as any that I know.  When I have been for the
defence, and believed my man was innocent, I was glad to have him
against us!"

"That is high praise, sir!" said the Superintendent gratified:  "I am
glad you approve of my choice; that I did well in sending for him."

I answered heartily:

"Could not be better.  I do not doubt that between you we shall get at
the facts--and what lies behind them!"

We ascended to Mr. Trelawny's room, where we found everything exactly
as his daughter had described.

There came a ring at the house bell, and a minute later a man was shown
into the room.  A young man with aquiline features, keen grey eyes, and
a forehead that stood out square and broad as that of a thinker.  In
his hand he had a black bag which he at once opened.  Miss Trelawny
introduced us:  "Doctor Winchester, Mr. Ross, Superintendent Dolan."
We bowed mutually, and he, without a moment's delay, began his work.
We all waited, and eagerly watched him as he proceeded to dress the
wound. As he went on he turned now and again to call the
Superintendent's attention to some point about the wound, the latter
proceeding to enter the fact at once in his notebook.

"See! several parallel cuts or scratches beginning on the left side of
the wrist and in some places endangering the radial artery.

"These small wounds here, deep and jagged, seem as if made with a blunt
instrument.  This in particular would seem as if made with some kind of
sharp wedge; the flesh round it seems torn as if with lateral pressure."

Turning to Miss Trelawny he said presently:

"Do you think we might remove this bangle?  It is not absolutely
necessary, as it will fall lower on the wrist where it can hang
loosely; but it might add to the patient's comfort later on."  The poor
girl flushed deeply as she answered in a low voice:

"I do not know.  I--I have only recently come to live with my Father;
and I know so little of his life or his ideas that I fear I can hardly
judge in such a matter.  The Doctor, after a keen glance at her, said
in a very kindly way:

"Forgive me!  I did not know.  But in any case you need not be
distressed.  It is not required at present to move it.  Were it so I
should do so at once on my own responsibility.  If it be necessary
later on, we can easily remove it with a file.  Your Father doubtless
has some object in keeping it as it is.  See! there is a tiny key
attached to it...." As he was speaking he stopped and bent lower,
taking from my hand the candle which I held and lowering it till its
light fell on the bangle.  Then motioning me to hold the candle in the
same position, he took from his pocket a magnifying-glass which he
adjusted.  When he had made a careful examination he stood up and
handed the magnifying-glass to Dolan, saying as he did so:

"You had better examine it yourself.  That is no ordinary bangle.  The
gold is wrought over triple steel links; see where it is worn away.  It
is manifestly not meant to be removed lightly; and it would need more
than an ordinary file to do it."

The Superintendent bent his great body; but not getting close enough
that way knelt down by the sofa as the Doctor had done.  He examined
the bangle minutely, turning it slowly round so that no particle of it
escaped observation. Then he stood up and handed the magnifying-glass
to me.  "When you have examined it yourself," he said, "let the lady
look at it if she will," and he commenced to write at length in his
notebook.

I made a simple alteration in his suggestion.  I held out the glass
toward Miss Trelawny, saying:

"Had you not better examine it first?"  She drew back, slightly raising
her hand in disclaimer, as she said impulsively:

"Oh no!  Father would doubtless have shown it to me had he wished me to
see it. I would not like to without his consent."  Then she added,
doubtless fearing lest her delicacy of view should give offence to the
rest of us:

"Of course it is right that you should see it.  You have to examine and
consider everything; and indeed--indeed I am grateful to you..."

She turned away; I could see that she was crying quietly.  It was
evident to me that even in the midst of her trouble and anxiety there
was a chagrin that she knew so little of her father; and that her
ignorance had to be shown at such a time and amongst so many strangers.
That they were all men did not make the shame more easy to bear, though
there was a certain relief in it.  Trying to interpret her feelings I
could not but think that she must have been glad that no woman's
eyes--of understanding greater than man's--were upon her in that hour.

When I stood up from my examination, which verified to me that of the
Doctor, the latter resumed his place beside the couch and went on with
his ministrations. Superintendent Dolan said to me in a whisper:

"I think we are fortunate in our doctor!" I nodded, and was about to
add something in praise of his acumen, when there came a low tapping at
the door.




Chapter II

Strange Instructions


Superintendent Dolan went quietly to the door; by a sort of natural
understanding he had taken possession of affairs in the room.  The rest
of us waited.  He opened the door a little way; and then with a gesture
of manifest relief threw it wide, and a young man stepped in.  A young
man clean-shaven, tall and slight; with an eagle face and bright, quick
eyes that seemed to take in everything around him at a glance.  As he
came in, the Superintendent held out his hand; the two men shook hands
warmly.

"I came at once, sir, the moment I got your message.  I am glad I still
have your confidence."

"That you'll always have," said the Superintendent heartily.  "I have
not forgotten our old Bow Street days, and I never shall!"  Then,
without a word of preliminary, he began to tell everything he knew up
to the moment of the newcomer's entry. Sergeant Daw asked a few
questions--a very few--when it was necessary for his understanding of
circumstances or the relative positions of persons; but as a rule
Dolan, who knew his work thoroughly, forestalled every query, and
explained all necessary matters as he went on.  Sergeant Daw threw
occasionally swift glances round him; now at one of us; now at the room
or some part of it; now at the wounded man lying senseless on the sofa.

When the Superintendent had finished, the Sergeant turned to me and
said:

"Perhaps you remember me, sir.  I was with you in that Hoxton case."

"I remember you very well," I said as I held out my hand.  The
Superintendent spoke again:

"You understand, Sergeant Daw, that you are put in full charge of this
case."

"Under you I hope, sir," he interrupted.  The other shook his head and
smiled as he said:

"It seems to me that this is a case that will take all a man's time and
his brains.  I have other work to do; but I shall be more than
interested, and if I can help in any possible way I shall be glad to do
so!"

"All right, sir," said the other, accepting his responsibility with a
sort of modified salute; straightway he began his investigation.

First he came over to the Doctor and, having learned his name and
address, asked him to write a full report which he could use, and which
he could refer to headquarters if necessary.  Doctor Winchester bowed
gravely as he promised.  Then the Sergeant approached me and said sotto
voce:

"I like the look of your doctor.  I think we can work together!"
Turning to Miss Trelawny he asked:

"Please let me know what you can of your Father; his ways of life, his
history--in fact of anything of whatsoever kind which interests him, or
in which he may be concerned."  I was about to interrupt to tell him
what she had already said of her ignorance in all matters of her father
and his ways, but her warning hand was raised to me pointedly and she
spoke herself.

"Alas!  I know little or nothing.  Superintendent Dolan and Mr. Ross
know already all I can say."

"Well, ma'am, we must be content to do what we can," said the officer
genially. "I'll begin by making a minute examination.  You say that you
were outside the door when you heard the noise?"

"I was in my room when I heard the queer sound--indeed it must have
been the early part of whatever it was which woke me.  I came out of my
room at once. Father's door was shut, and I could see the whole landing
and the upper slopes of the staircase.  No one could have left by the
door unknown to me, if that is what you mean!"

"That is just what I do mean, miss.  If every one who knows anything
will tell me as well as that, we shall soon get to the bottom of this."

He then went over to the bed, looked at it carefully, and asked:

"Has the bed been touched?"

"Not to my knowledge," said Miss Trelawny, "but I shall ask Mrs.
Grant--the housekeeper," she added as she rang the bell.  Mrs. Grant
answered it in person. "Come in," said Miss Trelawny.  "These gentlemen
want to know, Mrs. Grant, if the bed has been touched."

"Not by me, ma'am."

"Then," said Miss Trelawny, turning to Sergeant Daw, "it cannot have
been touched by any one.  Either Mrs. Grant or I myself was here all
the time, and I do not think any of the servants who came when I gave
the alarm were near the bed at all.  You see, Father lay here just
under the great safe, and every one crowded round him.  We sent them
all away in a very short time."  Daw, with a motion of his hand, asked
us all to stay at the other side of the room whilst with a
magnifying-glass he examined the bed, taking care as he moved each fold
of the bed-clothes to replace it in exact position.  Then he examined
with his magnifying-glass the floor beside it, taking especial pains
where the blood had trickled over the side of the bed, which was of
heavy red wood handsomely carved. Inch by inch, down on his knees,
carefully avoiding any touch with the stains on the floor, he followed
the blood-marks over to the spot, close under the great safe, where the
body had lain.  All around and about this spot he went for a radius of
some yards; but seemingly did not meet with anything to arrest special
attention.  Then he examined the front of the safe; round the lock, and
along the bottom and top of the double doors, more especially at the
places of their touching in front.

Next he went to the windows, which were fastened down with the hasps.

"Were the shutters closed?" he asked Miss Trelawny in a casual way as
though he expected the negative answer, which came.

All this time Doctor Winchester was attending to his patient; now
dressing the wounds in the wrist or making minute examination all over
the head and throat, and over the heart.  More than once he put his
nose to the mouth of the senseless man and sniffed.  Each time he did
so he finished up by unconsciously looking round the room, as though in
search of something.

Then we heard the deep strong voice of the Detective:

"So far as I can see, the object was to bring that key to the lock of
the safe.  There seems to be some secret in the mechanism that I am
unable to guess at, though I served a year in Chubb's before I joined
the police.  It is a combination lock of seven letters; but there seems
to be a way of locking even the combination.  It is one of Chatwood's;
I shall call at their place and find out something about it."  Then
turning to the Doctor, as though his own work were for the present
done, he said:

"Have you anything you can tell me at once, Doctor, which will not
interfere with your full report?  If there is any doubt I can wait, but
the sooner I know something definite the better."  Doctor Winchester
answered at once:

"For my own part I see no reason in waiting.  I shall make a full
report of course.  But in the meantime I shall tell you all I
know--which is after all not very much, and all I think--which is less
definite.  There is no wound on the head which could account for the
state of stupor in which the patient continues.  I must, therefore,
take it that either he has been drugged or is under some hypnotic
influence.  So far as I can judge, he has not been drugged--at least by
means of any drug of whose qualities I am aware.  Of course, there is
ordinarily in this room so much of a mummy smell that it is difficult
to be certain about anything having a delicate aroma.  I dare say that
you have noticed the peculiar Egyptians scents, bitumen, nard, aromatic
gums and spices, and so forth. It is quite possible that somewhere in
this room, amongst the curios and hidden by stronger scents, is some
substance or liquid which may have the effect we see.  It is possible
that the patient has taken some drug, and that he may in some sleeping
phase have injured himself.  I do not think this is likely; and
circumstances, other than those which I have myself been investigating,
may prove that this surmise is not correct. But in the meantime it is
possible; and must, till it be disproved, be kept within our purview."
Here Sergeant Daw interrupted:

"That may be, but if so, we should be able to find the instrument with
which the wrist was injured.  There would be marks of blood somewhere."

"Exactly so!" said the Doctor, fixing his glasses as though preparing
for an argument. "But if it be that the patient has used some strange
drug, it may be one that does not take effect at once.  As we are as
yet ignorant of its potentialities--if, indeed, the whole surmise is
correct at all--we must be prepared at all points."

Here Miss Trelawny joined in the conversation:

"That would be quite right, so far as the action of the drug was
concerned; but according to the second part of your surmise the wound
may have been self-inflicted, and this after the drug had taken effect."

"True!" said the Detective and the Doctor simultaneously.  She went on:

"As however, Doctor, your guess does not exhaust the possibilities, we
must bear in mind that some other variant of the same root-idea may be
correct.  I take it, therefore, that our first search, to be made on
this assumption, must be for the weapon with which the injury was done
to my Father's wrist."

"Perhaps he put the weapon in the safe before he became quite
unconscious," said I, giving voice foolishly to a half-formed thought.

"That could not be," said the Doctor quickly.  "At least I think it
could hardly be," he added cautiously, with a brief bow to me.  "You
see, the left hand is covered with blood; but there is no blood mark
whatever on the safe."

"Quite right!" I said, and there was a long pause.

The first to break the silence was the Doctor.

"We shall want a nurse here as soon as possible; and I know the very
one to suit.  I shall go at once to get her if I can.  I must ask that
till I return some of you will remain constantly with the patient.  It
may be necessary to remove him to another room later on; but in the
meantime he is best left here.  Miss Trelawny, may I take it that
either you or Mrs. Grant will remain here--not merely in the room, but
close to the patient and watchful of him--till I return?"

She bowed in reply, and took a seat beside the sofa.  The Doctor gave
her some directions as to what she should do in case her father should
become conscious before his return.

The next to move was Superintendent Dolan, who came close to Sergeant
Daw as he said:

"I had better return now to the station--unless, of course, you should
wish me to remain for a while."

He answered, "Is Johnny Wright still in your division?"

"Yes!  Would you like him to be with you?"  The other nodded reply.
"Then I will send him on to you as soon as can be arranged.  He shall
then stay with you as long as you wish.  I will tell him that he is to
take his instructions entirely from you."

The Sergeant accompanied him to the door, saying as he went:

"Thank you, sir; you are always thoughtful for men who are working with
you.  It is a pleasure to me to be with you again.  I shall go back to
Scotland Yard and report to my chief.  Then I shall call at Chatwood's;
and I shall return here as soon as possible. I suppose I may take it,
miss, that I may put up here for a day or two, if required.  It may be
some help, or possibly some comfort to you, if I am about, until we
unravel this mystery."

"I shall be very grateful to you."  He looked keenly at her for a few
seconds before he spoke again.

"Before I go have I permission to look about your Father's table and
desk?  There might be something which would give us a clue--or a lead
at all events."  Her answer was so unequivocal as almost to surprise
him.

"You have the fullest possible permission to do anything which may help
us in this dreadful trouble--to discover what it is that is wrong with
my Father, or which may shield him in the future!"

He began at once a systematic search of the dressing-table, and after
that of the writing-table in the room.  In one of the drawers he found
a letter sealed; this he brought at once across the room and handed to
Miss Trelawny.

"A letter--directed to me--and in my Father's hand!" she said as she
eagerly opened it.  I watched her face as she began to read; but seeing
at once that Sergeant Daw kept his keen eyes on her face, unflinchingly
watching every flitting expression, I kept my eyes henceforth fixed on
his.  When Miss Trelawny had read her letter through, I had in my mind
a conviction, which, however, I kept locked in my own heart.  Amongst
the suspicions in the mind of the Detective was one, rather perhaps
potential than definite, of Miss Trelawny herself.

For several minutes Miss Trelawny held the letter in her hand with her
eyes downcast, thinking.  Then she read it carefully again; this time
the varying expressions were intensified, and I thought I could easily
follow them.  When she had finished the second reading, she paused
again.  Then, though with some reluctance, she handed the letter to the
Detective.  He read it eagerly but with unchanging face; read it a
second time, and then handed it back with a bow.  She paused a little
again, and then handed it to me.  As she did so she raised her eyes to
mine for a single moment appealingly; a swift blush spread over her
pale cheeks and forehead.

With mingled feelings I took it, but, all said, I was glad.  She did
not show any perturbation in giving the letter to the Detective--she
might not have shown any to anyone else.  But to me... I feared to
follow the thought further; but read on, conscious that the eyes of
both Miss Trelawny and the Detective were fixed on me.


"MY DEAR DAUGHTER,  I want you to take this letter as an
instruction--absolute and imperative, and admitting of no deviation
whatever--in case anything untoward or unexpected by you or by others
should happen to me. If I should be suddenly and mysteriously stricken
down--either by sickness, accident or attack--you must follow these
directions implicitly.  If I am not already in my bedroom when you are
made cognisant of my state, I am to be brought there as quickly as
possible. Even should I be dead, my body is to be brought there.
Thenceforth, until I am either conscious and able to give instructions
on my own account, or buried, I am never to be left alone--not for a
single instant.  From nightfall to sunrise at least two persons must
remain in the room.  It will be well that a trained nurse be in the
room from time to time, and will note any symptoms, either permanent or
changing, which may strike her.  My solicitors, Marvin & Jewkes, of 27B
Lincoln's Inn, have full instructions in case of my death; and Mr.
Marvin has himself undertaken to see personally my wishes carried out.
I should advise you, my dear Daughter, seeing that you have no relative
to apply to, to get some friend whom you can trust to either remain
within the house where instant communication can be made, or to come
nightly to aid in the watching, or to be within call.  Such friend may
be either male or female; but, whichever it may be, there should be
added one other watcher or attendant at hand of the opposite sex.
Understand, that it is of the very essence of my wish that there should
be, awake and exercising themselves to my purposes, both masculine and
feminine intelligences.  Once more, my dear Margaret, let me impress on
you the need for observation and just reasoning to conclusions,
howsoever strange.  If I am taken ill or injured, this will be no
ordinary occasion; and I wish to warn you, so that your guarding may be
complete.

"Nothing in my room--I speak of the curios--must be removed or
displaced in any way, or for any cause whatever.  I have a special
reason and a special purpose in the placing of each; so that any moving
of them would thwart my plans.

"Should you want money or counsel in anything, Mr. Marvin will carry
out your wishes; to the which he has my full instructions."

          "ABEL TRELAWNY."


I read the letter a second time before speaking, for I feared to betray
myself.  The choice of a friend might be a momentous occasion for me.
I had already ground for hope, that she had asked me to help her in the
first throe of her trouble; but love makes its own doubtings, and I
feared.  My thoughts seemed to whirl with lightning rapidity, and in a
few seconds a whole process of reasoning became formulated.  I must not
volunteer to be the friend that the father advised his daughter to have
to aid her in her vigil; and yet that one glance had a lesson which I
must not ignore.  Also, did not she, when she wanted help, send to
me--to me a stranger, except for one meeting at a dance and one brief
afternoon of companionship on the river?  Would it not humiliate her to
make her ask me twice?  Humiliate her!  No! that pain I could at all
events save her; it is not humiliation to refuse.  So, as I handed her
back the letter, I said:

"I know you will forgive me, Miss Trelawny, if I presume too much; but
if you will permit me to aid in the watching I shall be proud.  Though
the occasion is a sad one, I shall be so far happy to be allowed the
privilege."

Despite her manifest and painful effort at self-control, the red tide
swept her face and neck.  Even her eyes seemed suffused, and in stern
contrast with her pale cheeks when the tide had rolled back.  She
answered in a low voice:

"I shall be very grateful for your help!"  Then in an afterthought she
added:

"But you must not let me be selfish in my need!  I know you have many
duties to engage you; and though I shall value your help highly--most
highly--it would not be fair to monopolise your time."

"As to that," I answered at once, "my time is yours.  I can for today
easily arrange my work so that I can come here in the afternoon and
stay till morning.  After that, if the occasion still demands it, I can
so arrange my work that I shall have more time still at my disposal."

She was much moved.  I could see the tears gather in her eyes, and she
turned away her head.  The Detective spoke:

"I am glad you will be here, Mr. Ross.  I shall be in the house myself,
as Miss Trelawny will allow me, if my people in Scotland Yard will
permit.  That letter seems to put a different complexion on everything;
though the mystery remains greater than ever. If you can wait here an
hour or two I shall go to headquarters, and then to the safe-makers.
After that I shall return; and you can go away easier in your mind, for
I shall be here."

When he had gone, we two, Miss Trelawny and I, remained in silence.  At
last she raised her eyes and looked at me for a moment; after that I
would not have exchanged places with a king.  For a while she busied
herself round the extemporised bedside of her father.  Then, asking me
to be sure not to take my eyes off him till she returned, she hurried
out.

In a few minutes she came back with Mrs. Grant and two maids and a
couple of men, who bore the entire frame and furniture of a light iron
bed.  This they proceeded to put together and to make.  When the work
was completed, and the servants had withdrawn, she said to me:

"It will be well to be all ready when the Doctor returns.  He will
surely want to have Father put to bed; and a proper bed will be better
for him than the sofa."  She then got a chair close beside her father,
and sat down watching him.

I went about the room, taking accurate note of all I saw.  And truly
there were enough things in the room to evoke the curiosity of any
man--even though the attendant circumstances were less strange.  The
whole place, excepting those articles of furniture necessary to a
well-furnished bedroom, was filled with magnificent curios, chiefly
Egyptian. As the room was of immense size there was opportunity for the
placing of a large number of them, even if, as with these, they were of
huge proportions.

Whilst I was still investigating the room there came the sound of
wheels on the gravel outside the house.  There was a ring at the hall
door, and a few minutes later, after a preliminary tap at the door and
an answering "Come in!" Doctor Winchester entered, followed by a young
woman in the dark dress of a nurse.

"I have been fortunate!" he said as he came in.  "I found her at once
and free. Miss Trelawny, this is Nurse Kennedy!"




Chapter III

The Watchers


I was struck by the way the two young women looked at each other.  I
suppose I have been so much in the habit of weighing up in my own mind
the personality of witnesses and of forming judgment by their
unconscious action and mode of bearing themselves, that the habit
extends to my life outside as well as within the court-house.  At this
moment of my life anything that interested Miss Trelawny interested me;
and as she had been struck by the newcomer I instinctively weighed her
up also. By comparison of the two I seemed somehow to gain a new
knowledge of Miss Trelawny.  Certainly, the two women made a good
contrast.  Miss Trelawny was of fine figure; dark, straight-featured.
She had marvellous eyes; great, wide-open, and as black and soft as
velvet, with a mysterious depth.  To look in them was like gazing at a
black mirror such as Doctor Dee used in his wizard rites.  I heard an
old gentleman at the picnic, a great oriental traveller, describe the
effect of her eyes "as looking at night at the great distant lamps of a
mosque through the open door."  The eyebrows were typical.  Finely
arched and rich in long curling hair, they seemed like the proper
architectural environment of the deep, splendid eyes.  Her hair was
black also, but was as fine as silk.  Generally black hair is a type of
animal strength and seems as if some strong expression of the forces of
a strong nature; but in this case there could be no such thought.
There were refinement and high breeding; and though there was no
suggestion of weakness, any sense of power there was, was rather
spiritual than animal.  The whole harmony of her being seemed complete.
Carriage, figure, hair, eyes; the mobile, full mouth, whose scarlet
lips and white teeth seemed to light up the lower part of the face--as
the eyes did the upper; the wide sweep of the jaw from chin to ear; the
long, fine fingers; the hand which seemed to move from the wrist as
though it had a sentience of its own.  All these perfections went to
make up a personality that dominated either by its grace, its
sweetness, its beauty, or its charm.

Nurse Kennedy, on the other hand, was rather under than over a woman's
average height.  She was firm and thickset, with full limbs and broad,
strong, capable hands. Her colour was in the general effect that of an
autumn leaf.  The yellow-brown hair was thick and long, and the
golden-brown eyes sparkled from the freckled, sunburnt skin.  Her rosy
cheeks gave a general idea of rich brown.  The red lips and white teeth
did not alter the colour scheme, but only emphasized it.  She had a
snub nose--there was no possible doubt about it; but like such noses in
general it showed a nature generous, untiring, and full of good-nature.
Her broad white forehead, which even the freckles had spared, was full
of forceful thought and reason.

Doctor Winchester had on their journey from the hospital, coached her
in the necessary particulars, and without a word she took charge of the
patient and set to work.  Having examined the new-made bed and shaken
the pillows, she spoke to the Doctor, who gave instructions; presently
we all four, stepping together, lifted the unconscious man from the
sofa.

Early in the afternoon, when Sergeant Daw had returned, I called at my
rooms in Jermyn Street, and sent out such clothes, books and papers as
I should be likely to want within a few days.  Then I went on to keep
my legal engagements.

The Court sat late that day as an important case was ending; it was
striking six as I drove in at the gate of the Kensington Palace Road.
I found myself installed in a large room close to the sick chamber.

That night we were not yet regularly organised for watching, so that
the early part of the evening showed an unevenly balanced guard.  Nurse
Kennedy, who had been on duty all day, was lying down, as she had
arranged to come on again by twelve o'clock.  Doctor Winchester, who
was dining in the house, remained in the room until dinner was
announced; and went back at once when it was over.  During dinner Mrs.
Grant remained in the room, and with her Sergeant Daw, who wished to
complete a minute examination which he had undertaken of everything in
the room and near it.  At nine o'clock Miss Trelawny and I went in to
relieve the Doctor. She had lain down for a few hours in the afternoon
so as to be refreshed for her work at night.  She told me that she had
determined that for this night at least she would sit up and watch.  I
did not try to dissuade her, for I knew that her mind was made up.
Then and there I made up my mind that I would watch with her--unless,
of course, I should see that she really did not wish it.  I said
nothing of my intentions for the present.  We came in on tiptoe, so
silently that the Doctor, who was bending over the bed, did not hear
us, and seemed a little startled when suddenly looking up he saw our
eyes upon him.  I felt that the mystery of the whole thing was getting
on his nerves, as it had already got on the nerves of some others of
us.  He was, I fancied, a little annoyed with himself for having been
so startled, and at once began to talk in a hurried manner as though to
get over our idea of his embarrassment:

"I am really and absolutely at my wits' end to find any fit cause for
this stupor.  I have made again as accurate an examination as I know
how, and I am satisfied that there is no injury to the brain, that is,
no external injury.  Indeed, all his vital organs seem unimpaired.  I
have given him, as you know, food several times and it has manifestly
done him good.  His breathing is strong and regular, and his pulse is
slower and stronger than it was this morning.  I cannot find evidence
of any known drug, and his unconsciousness does not resemble any of the
many cases of hypnotic sleep which I saw in the Charcot Hospital in
Paris.  And as to these wounds"--he laid his finger gently on the
bandaged wrist which lay outside the coverlet as he spoke, "I do not
know what to make of them.  They might have been made by a
carding-machine; but that supposition is untenable.  It is within the
bounds of possibility that they might have been made by a wild animal
if it had taken care to sharpen its claws.  That too is, I take it,
impossible. By the way, have you any strange pets here in the house;
anything of an exceptional kind, such as a tiger-cat or anything out of
the common?" Miss Trelawny smiled a sad smile which made my heart ache,
as she made answer:

"Oh no!  Father does not like animals about the house, unless they are
dead and mummied."  This was said with a touch of bitterness--or
jealousy, I could hardly tell which.  "Even my poor kitten was only
allowed in the house on sufferance; and though he is the dearest and
best-conducted cat in the world, he is now on a sort of parole, and is
not allowed into this room."

As she was speaking a faint rattling of the door handle was heard.
Instantly Miss Trelawny's face brightened.  She sprang up and went over
to the door, saying as she went:

"There he is!  That is my Silvio.  He stands on his hind legs and
rattles the door handle when he wants to come into a room."  She opened
the door, speaking to the cat as though he were a baby:  "Did him want
his movver?  Come then; but he must stay with her!"  She lifted the
cat, and came back with him in her arms.  He was certainly a
magnificent animal.  A chinchilla grey Persian with long silky hair; a
really lordly animal with a haughty bearing despite his gentleness; and
with great paws which spread out as he placed them on the ground.
Whilst she was fondling him, he suddenly gave a wriggle like an eel and
slipped out of her arms.  He ran across the room and stood opposite a
low table on which stood the mummy of an animal, and began to mew and
snarl.  Miss Trelawny was after him in an instant and lifted him in her
arms, kicking and struggling and wriggling to get away; but not biting
or scratching, for evidently he loved his beautiful mistress.  He
ceased to make a noise the moment he was in her arms; in a whisper she
admonished him:

"O you naughty Silvio!  You have broken your parole that mother gave
for you.  Now, say goodnight to the gentlemen, and come away to
mother's room!"  As she was speaking she held out the cat's paw to me
to shake. As I did so I could not but admire its size and beauty.
"Why," said I, "his paw seems like a little boxing-glove full of
claws."  She smiled:

"So it ought to.  Don't you notice that my Silvio has seven toes, see!"
she opened the paw; and surely enough there were seven separate claws,
each of them sheathed in a delicate, fine, shell-like case.  As I
gently stroked the foot the claws emerged and one of them
accidentally--there was no anger now and the cat was purring--stuck
into my hand. Instinctively I said as I drew back:

"Why, his claws are like razors!"

Doctor Winchester had come close to us and was bending over looking at
the cat's claws; as I spoke he said in a quick, sharp way:

"Eh!"  I could hear the quick intake of his breath.  Whilst I was
stroking the now quiescent cat, the Doctor went to the table and tore
off a piece of blotting-paper from the writing-pad and came back.  He
laid the paper on his palm and, with a simple "pardon me!" to Miss
Trelawny, placed the cat's paw on it and pressed it down with his other
hand.  The haughty cat seemed to resent somewhat the familiarity, and
tried to draw its foot away.  This was plainly what the Doctor wanted,
for in the act the cat opened the sheaths of its claws and and made
several reefs in the soft paper. Then Miss Trelawny took her pet away.
She returned in a couple of minutes; as she came in she said:

"It is most odd about that mummy!  When Silvio came into the room
first--indeed I took him in as a kitten to show to Father--he went on
just the same way.  He jumped up on the table, and tried to scratch and
bite the mummy.  That was what made Father so angry, and brought the
decree of banishment on poor Silvio.  Only his parole, given through
me, kept him in the house."

Whilst she had been gone, Doctor Winchester had taken the bandage from
her father's wrist.  The wound was now quite clear, as the separate
cuts showed out in fierce red lines.  The Doctor folded the
blotting-paper across the line of punctures made by the cat's claws,
and held it down close to the wound.  As he did so, he looked up
triumphantly and beckoned us over to him.

The cuts in the paper corresponded with the wounds in the wrist!  No
explanation was needed, as he said:

"It would have been better if master Silvio had not broken his parole!"

We were all silent for a little while.  Suddenly Miss Trelawny said:

"But Silvio was not in here last night!"

"Are you sure?  Could you prove that if necessary?"  She hesitated
before replying:

"I am certain of it; but I fear it would be difficult to prove.  Silvio
sleeps in a basket in my room.  I certainly put him to bed last night;
I remember distinctly laying his little blanket over him, and tucking
him in.  This morning I took him out of the basket myself.  I certainly
never noticed him in here; though, of course, that would not mean much,
for I was too concerned about poor father, and too much occupied with
him, to notice even Silvio."

The Doctor shook his head as he said with a certain sadness:

"Well, at any rate it is no use trying to prove anything now.  Any cat
in the world would have cleaned blood-marks--did any exist--from his
paws in a hundredth part of the time that has elapsed."

Again we were all silent; and again the silence was broken by Miss
Trelawny:

"But now that I think of it, it could not have been poor Silvio that
injured Father. My door was shut when I first heard the sound; and
Father's was shut when I listened at it.  When I went in, the injury
had been done; so that it must have been before Silvio could possibly
have got in."  This reasoning commended itself, especially to me as a
barrister, for it was proof to satisfy a jury.  It gave me a distinct
pleasure to have Silvio acquitted of the crime--possibly because he was
Miss Trelawny's cat and was loved by her.  Happy cat!  Silvio's
mistress was manifestly pleased as I said:

"Verdict, 'not guilty!'"  Doctor Winchester after a pause observed:

"My apologies to master Silvio on this occasion; but I am still puzzled
to know why he is so keen against that mummy.  Is he the same toward
the other mummies in the house?  There are, I suppose, a lot of them.
I saw three in the hall as I came in."

"There are lots of them," she answered.  "I sometimes don't know
whether I am in a private house or the British Museum.  But Silvio
never concerns himself about any of them except that particular one.  I
suppose it must be because it is of an animal, not a man or a woman."

"Perhaps it is of a cat!" said the Doctor as he started up and went
across the room to look at the mummy more closely.  "Yes," he went on,
"it is the mummy of a cat; and a very fine one, too.  If it hadn't been
a special favourite of some very special person it would never have
received so much honour.  See!  A painted case and obsidian eyes--just
like a human mummy.  It is an extraordinary thing, that knowledge of
kind to kind.  Here is a dead cat--that is all; it is perhaps four or
five thousand years old--and another cat of another breed, in what is
practically another world, is ready to fly at it, just as it would if
it were not dead.  I should like to experiment a bit about that cat if
you don't mind, Miss Trelawny."  She hesitated before replying:

"Of course, do anything you may think necessary or wise; but I hope it
will not be anything to hurt or worry my poor Silvio."  The Doctor
smiled as he answered:

"Oh, Silvio would be all right:  it is the other one that my sympathies
would be reserved for."

"How do you mean?"

"Master Silvio will do the attacking; the other one will do the
suffering."

"Suffering?"  There was a note of pain in her voice.  The Doctor smiled
more broadly:

"Oh, please make your mind easy as to that.  The other won't suffer as
we understand it; except perhaps in his structure and outfit."

"What on earth do you mean?"

"Simply this, my dear young lady, that the antagonist will be a mummy
cat like this one.  There are, I take it, plenty of them to be had in
Museum Street.  I shall get one and place it here instead of that
one--you won't think that a temporary exchange will violate your
Father's instructions, I hope.  We shall then find out, to begin with,
whether Silvio objects to all mummy cats, or only to this one in
particular."

"I don't know," she said doubtfully.  "Father's instructions seem very
uncompromising."  Then after a pause she went on:  "But of course under
the circumstances anything that is to be ultimately for his good must
be done.  I suppose there can't be anything very particular about the
mummy of a cat."

Doctor Winchester said nothing.  He sat rigid, with so grave a look on
his face that his extra gravity passed on to me; and in its
enlightening perturbation I began to realise more than I had yet done
the strangeness of the case in which I was now so deeply concerned.
When once this thought had begun there was no end to it.  Indeed it
grew, and blossomed, and reproduced itself in a thousand different
ways.  The room and all in it gave grounds for strange thoughts.  There
were so many ancient relics that unconsciously one was taken back to
strange lands and strange times.  There were so many mummies or mummy
objects, round which there seemed to cling for ever the penetrating
odours of bitumen, and spices and gums--"Nard and Circassia's balmy
smells"--that one was unable to forget the past.  Of course, there was
but little light in the room, and that carefully shaded; so that there
was no glare anywhere. None of that direct light which can manifest
itself as a power or an entity, and so make for companionship.  The
room was a large one, and lofty in proportion to its size.  In its
vastness was place for a multitude of things not often found in a
bedchamber.  In far corners of the room were shadows of uncanny shape.
More than once as I thought, the multitudinous presence of the dead and
the past took such hold on me that I caught myself looking round
fearfully as though some strange personality or influence was present.
Even the manifest presence of Doctor Winchester and Miss Trelawny could
not altogether comfort or satisfy me at such moments.  It was with a
distinct sense of relief that I saw a new personality in the room in
the shape of Nurse Kennedy. There was no doubt that that business-like,
self-reliant, capable young woman added an element of security to such
wild imaginings as my own. She had a quality of common sense that
seemed to pervade everything around her, as though it were some kind of
emanation.  Up to that moment I had been building fancies around the
sick man; so that finally all about him, including myself, had become
involved in them, or enmeshed, or saturated, or... But now that she had
come, he relapsed into his proper perspective as a patient; the room
was a sick-room, and the shadows lost their fearsome quality.  The only
thing which it could not altogether abrogate was the strange Egyptian
smell. You may put a mummy in a glass case and hermetically seal it so
that no corroding air can get within; but all the same it will exhale
its odour.  One might think that four or five thousand years would
exhaust the olfactory qualities of anything; but experience teaches us
that these smells remain, and that their secrets are unknown to us.
Today they are as much mysteries as they were when the embalmers put
the body in the bath of natron...


All at once I sat up.  I had become lost in an absorbing reverie.  The
Egyptian smell had seemed to get on my nerves--on my memory--on my very
will.

At that moment I had a thought which was like an inspiration.  If I was
influenced in such a manner by the smell, might it not be that the sick
man, who lived half his life or more in the atmosphere, had gradually
and by slow but sure process taken into his system something which had
permeated him to such degree that it had a new power derived from
quantity--or strength--or...

I was becoming lost again in a reverie.  This would not do.  I must
take such precaution that I could remain awake, or free from such
entrancing thought.  I had had but half a night's sleep last night; and
this night I must remain awake.  Without stating my intention, for I
feared that I might add to the trouble and uneasiness of Miss Trelawny,
I went downstairs and out of the house.  I soon found a chemist's shop,
and came away with a respirator.  When I got back, it was ten o'clock;
the Doctor was going for the night.  The Nurse came with him to the
door of the sick-room, taking her last instructions.  Miss Trelawny sat
still beside the bed.  Sergeant Daw, who had entered as the Doctor went
out, was some little distance off.

When Nurse Kennedy joined us, we arranged that she should sit up till
two o'clock, when Miss Trelawny would relieve her.  Thus, in accordance
with Mr. Trelawny's instructions, there would always be a man and a
woman in the room; and each one of us would overlap, so that at no time
would a new set of watchers come on duty without some one to tell of
what--if anything--had occurred.  I lay down on a sofa in my own room,
having arranged that one of the servants should call me a little before
twelve.  In a few moments I was asleep.

When I was waked, it took me several seconds to get back my thoughts so
as to recognise my own identity and surroundings.  The short sleep had,
however, done me good, and I could look on things around me in a more
practical light than I had been able to do earlier in the evening.  I
bathed my face, and thus refreshed went into the sick-room.  I moved
very softly.  The Nurse was sitting by the bed, quiet and alert; the
Detective sat in an arm-chair across the room in deep shadow.  He did
not move when I crossed, until I got close to him, when he said in a
dull whisper:

"It is all right; I have not been asleep!"  An unnecessary thing to
say, I thought--it always is, unless it be untrue in spirit.  When I
told him that his watch was over; that he might go to bed till I should
call him at six o'clock, he seemed relieved and went with alacrity.  At
the door he turned and, coming back to me, said in a whisper:

"I sleep lightly and I shall have my pistols with me.  I won't feel so
heavy-headed when I get out of this mummy smell."

He too, then, had shared my experience of drowsiness!

I asked the Nurse if she wanted anything.  I noticed that she had a
vinaigrette in her lap.  Doubtless she, too, had felt some of the
influence which had so affected me. She said that she had all she
required, but that if she should want anything she would at once let me
know.  I wished to keep her from noticing my respirator, so I went to
the chair in the shadow where her back was toward me.  Here I quietly
put it on, and made myself comfortable.

For what seemed a long time, I sat and thought and thought.  It was a
wild medley of thoughts, as might have been expected from the
experiences of the previous day and night.  Again I found myself
thinking of the Egyptian smell; and I remember that I felt a delicious
satisfaction that I did not experience it as I had done.  The
respirator was doing its work.

It must have been that the passing of this disturbing thought made for
repose of mind, which is the corollary of bodily rest, for, though I
really cannot remember being asleep or waking from it, I saw a
vision--I dreamed a dream, I scarcely know which.

I was still in the room, seated in the chair.  I had on my respirator
and knew that I breathed freely.  The Nurse sat in her chair with her
back toward me.  She sat quite still.  The sick man lay as still as the
dead.  It was rather like the picture of a scene than the reality; all
were still and silent; and the stillness and silence were continuous.
Outside, in the distance I could hear the sounds of a city, the
occasional roll of wheels, the shout of a reveller, the far-away echo
of whistles and the rumbling of trains.  The light was very, very low;
the reflection of it under the green-shaded lamp was a dim relief to
the darkness, rather than light.  The green silk fringe of the lamp had
merely the colour of an emerald seen in the moonlight. The room, for
all its darkness, was full of shadows.  It seemed in my whirling
thoughts as though all the real things had become shadows--shadows
which moved, for they passed the dim outline of the high windows.
Shadows which had sentience. I even thought there was sound, a faint
sound as of the mew of a cat--the rustle of drapery and a metallic
clink as of metal faintly touching metal.  I sat as one entranced.  At
last I felt, as in nightmare, that this was sleep, and that in the
passing of its portals all my will had gone.

All at once my senses were full awake.  A shriek rang in my ears.  The
room was filled suddenly with a blaze of light.  There was the sound of
pistol shots--one, two; and a haze of white smoke in the room.  When my
waking eyes regained their power, I could have shrieked with horror
myself at what I saw before me.




Chapter IV

The Second Attempt


The sight which met my eyes had the horror of a dream within a dream,
with the certainty of reality added.  The room was as I had seen it
last; except that the shadowy look had gone in the glare of the many
lights, and every article in it stood stark and solidly real.

By the empty bed sat Nurse Kennedy, as my eyes had last seen her,
sitting bolt upright in the arm-chair beside the bed.  She had placed a
pillow behind her, so that her back might be erect; but her neck was
fixed as that of one in a cataleptic trance.  She was, to all intents
and purposes, turned into stone.  There was no special expression on
her face--no fear, no horror; nothing such as might be expected of one
in such a condition.  Her open eyes showed neither wonder nor interest.
She was simply a negative existence, warm, breathing, placid; but
absolutely unconscious of the world around her.  The bedclothes were
disarranged, as though the patient had been drawn from under them
without throwing them back.  The corner of the upper sheet hung upon
the floor; close by it lay one of the bandages with which the Doctor
had dressed the wounded wrist. Another and another lay further along
the floor, as though forming a clue to where the sick man now lay.
This was almost exactly where he had been found on the previous night,
under the great safe.  Again, the left arm lay toward the safe.  But
there had been a new outrage, an attempt had been made to sever the arm
close to the bangle which held the tiny key.  A heavy "kukri"
knife--one of the leaf-shaped knives which the Gurkhas and others of
the hill tribes of India use with such effect--had been taken from its
place on the wall, and with it the attempt had been made. It was
manifest that just at the moment of striking, the blow had been
arrested, for only the point of the knife and not the edge of the blade
had struck the flesh.  As it was, the outer side of the arm had been
cut to the bone and the blood was pouring out.  In addition, the former
wound in front of the arm had been cut or torn about terribly, one of
the cuts seemed to jet out blood as if with each pulsation of the
heart.  By the side of her father knelt Miss Trelawny, her white
nightdress stained with the blood in which she knelt.  In the middle of
the room Sergeant Daw, in his shirt and trousers and stocking feet, was
putting fresh cartridges into his revolver in a dazed mechanical kind
of way.  His eyes were red and heavy, and he seemed only half awake,
and less than half conscious of what was going on around him.  Several
servants, bearing lights of various kinds, were clustered round the
doorway.

As I rose from my chair and came forward, Miss Trelawny raised her eyes
toward me. When she saw me she shrieked and started to her feet,
pointing towards me.  Never shall I forget the strange picture she
made, with her white drapery all smeared with blood which, as she rose
from the pool, ran in streaks toward her bare feet.  I believe that I
had only been asleep; that whatever influence had worked on Mr.
Trelawny and Nurse Kennedy--and in less degree on Sergeant Daw--had not
touched me. The respirator had been of some service, though it had not
kept off the tragedy whose dire evidences were before me.  I can
understand now--I could understand even then--the fright, added to that
which had gone before, which my appearance must have evoked.  I had
still on the respirator, which covered mouth and nose; my hair had been
tossed in my sleep.  Coming suddenly forward, thus enwrapped and
dishevelled, in that horrified crowd, I must have had, in the strange
mixture of lights, an extraordinary and terrifying appearance.  It was
well that I recognised all this in time to avert another catastrophe;
for the half-dazed, mechanically-acting Detective put in the cartridges
and had raised his revolver to shoot at me when I succeeded in
wrenching off the respirator and shouting to him to hold his hand.  In
this also he acted mechanically; the red, half-awake eyes had not in
them even then the intention of conscious action.  The danger, however,
was averted.  The relief of the situation, strangely enough, came in a
simple fashion. Mrs. Grant, seeing that her young mistress had on only
her nightdress, had gone to fetch a dressing-gown, which she now threw
over her.  This simple act brought us all back to the region of fact.
With a long breath, one and all seemed to devote themselves to the most
pressing matter before us, that of staunching the flow of blood from
the arm of the wounded man.  Even as the thought of action came, I
rejoiced; for the bleeding was very proof that Mr. Trelawny still lived.

Last night's lesson was not thrown away.  More than one of those
present knew now what to do in such an emergency, and within a few
seconds willing hands were at work on a tourniquet.  A man was at once
despatched for the doctor, and several of the servants disappeared to
make themselves respectable.  We lifted Mr. Trelawny on to the sofa
where he had lain yesterday; and, having done what we could for him,
turned our attention to the Nurse.  In all the turmoil she had not
stirred; she sat there as before, erect and rigid, breathing softly and
naturally and with a placid smile. As it was manifestly of no use to
attempt anything with her till the doctor had come, we began to think
of the general situation.

Mrs. Grant had by this time taken her mistress away and changed her
clothes; for she was back presently in a dressing-gown and slippers,
and with the traces of blood removed from her hands.  She was now much
calmer, though she trembled sadly; and her face was ghastly white.
When she had looked at her father's wrist, I holding the tourniquet,
she turned her eyes round the room, resting them now and again on each
one of us present in turn, but seeming to find no comfort.  It was so
apparent to me that she did not know where to begin or whom to trust
that, to reassure her, I said:

"I am all right now; I was only asleep."  Her voice had a gulp in it as
she said in a low voice:

"Asleep!  You! and my Father in danger!  I thought you were on the
watch!"  I felt the sting of justice in the reproach; but I really
wanted to help her, so I answered:

"Only asleep.  It is bad enough, I know; but there is something more
than an "only" round us here.  Had it not been that I took a definite
precaution I might have been like the Nurse there."  She turned her
eyes swiftly on the weird figure, sitting grimly upright like a painted
statue; and then her face softened.  With the action of habitual
courtesy she said:

"Forgive me!  I did not mean to be rude.  But I am in such distress and
fear that I hardly know what I am saying.  Oh, it is dreadful!  I fear
for fresh trouble and horror and mystery every moment."  This cut me to
the very heart, and out of the heart's fulness I spoke:

"Don't give me a thought!  I don't deserve it.  I was on guard, and yet
I slept.  All that I can say is that I didn't mean to, and I tried to
avoid it; but it was over me before I knew it.  Anyhow, it is done now;
and can't be undone.  Probably some day we may understand it all; but
now let us try to get at some idea of what has happened.  Tell me what
you remember!"  The effort to recollect seemed to stimulate her; she
became calmer as she spoke:

"I was asleep, and woke suddenly with the same horrible feeling on me
that Father was in great and immediate danger.  I jumped up and ran,
just as I was, into his room.  It was nearly pitch dark, but as I
opened the door there was light enough to see Father's nightdress as he
lay on the floor under the safe, just as on that first awful night.
Then I think I must have gone mad for a moment."  She stopped and
shuddered. My eyes lit on Sergeant Daw, still fiddling in an aimless
way with the revolver.  Mindful of my work with the tourniquet, I said
calmly:

"Now tell us, Sergeant Daw, what did you fire at?"  The policeman
seemed to pull himself together with the habit of obedience.  Looking
around at the servants remaining in the room, he said with that air of
importance which, I take it, is the regulation attitude of an official
of the law before strangers:

"Don't you think, sir, that we can allow the servants to go away?  We
can then better go into the matter."  I nodded approval; the servants
took the hint and withdrew, though unwillingly, the last one closing
the door behind him.  Then the Detective went on:

"I think I had better tell you my impressions, sir, rather than recount
my actions. That is, so far as I remember them."  There was a mortified
deference now in his manner, which probably arose from his
consciousness of the awkward position in which he found himself.  "I
went to sleep half-dressed--as I am now, with a revolver under my
pillow.  It was the last thing I remember thinking of.  I do not know
how long I slept.  I had turned off the electric light, and it was
quite dark.  I thought I heard a scream; but I can't be sure, for I
felt thick-headed as a man does when he is called too soon after an
extra long stretch of work. Not that such was the case this time.
Anyhow my thoughts flew to the pistol.  I took it out, and ran on to
the landing.  Then I heard a sort of scream, or rather a call for help,
and ran into this room.  The room was dark, for the lamp beside the
Nurse was out, and the only light was that from the landing, coming
through the open door.  Miss Trelawny was kneeling on the floor beside
her father, and was screaming.  I thought I saw something move between
me and the window; so, without thinking, and being half dazed and only
half awake, I shot at it.  It moved a little more to the right between
the windows, and I shot again.  Then you came up out of the big chair
with all that muffling on your face.  It seemed to me, being as I say
half dazed and half awake--I know, sir, you will take this into
account--as if it had been you, being in the same direction as the
thing I had fired at.  And so I was about to fire again when you pulled
off the wrap."  Here I asked him--I was cross-examining now and felt at
home:

"You say you thought I was the thing you fired at.  What thing?"  The
man scratched his head, but made no reply.

"Come, sir," I said, "what thing; what was it like?"  The answer came
in a low voice:

"I don't know, sir.  I thought there was something; but what it was, or
what it was like, I haven't the faintest notion.  I suppose it was
because I had been thinking of the pistol before I went to sleep, and
because when I came in here I was half dazed and only half awake--which
I hope you will in future, sir, always remember."  He clung to that
formula of excuse as though it were his sheet-anchor.  I did not want
to antagonise the man; on the contrary I wanted to have him with us.
Besides, I had on me at that time myself the shadow of my own default;
so I said as kindly as I knew how:

"Quite right! Sergeant.  Your impulse was correct; though of course in
the half-somnolent condition in which you were, and perhaps partly
affected by the same influence--whatever it may be--which made me sleep
and which has put the Nurse in that cataleptic trance, it could not be
expected that you would paused to weigh matters.  But now, whilst the
matter is fresh, let me see exactly where you stood and where I sat.
We shall be able to trace the course of your bullets."  The prospect of
action and the exercise of his habitual skill seemed to brace him at
once; he seemed a different man as he set about his work.  I asked Mrs.
Grant to hold the tourniquet, and went and stood where he had stood and
looked where, in the darkness, he had pointed.  I could not but notice
the mechanical exactness of his mind, as when he showed me where he had
stood, or drew, as a matter of course, the revolver from his pistol
pocket, and pointed with it.  The chair from which I had risen still
stood in its place.  Then I asked him to point with his hand only, as I
wished to move in the track of his shot.

Just behind my chair, and a little back of it, stood a high buhl
cabinet.  The glass door was shattered.  I asked:

"Was this the direction of your first shot or your second?"  The answer
came promptly.

"The second; the first was over there!"

He turned a little to the left, more toward the wall where the great
safe stood, and pointed.  I followed the direction of his hand and came
to the low table whereon rested, amongst other curios, the mummy of the
cat which had raised Silvio's ire.  I got a candle and easily found the
mark of the bullet.  It had broken a little glass vase and a tazza of
black basalt, exquisitely engraved with hieroglyphics, the graven lines
being filled with some faint green cement and the whole thing being
polished to an equal surface.  The bullet, flattened against the wall,
lay on the table.

I then went to the broken cabinet.  It was evidently a receptacle for
valuable curios; for in it were some great scarabs of gold, agate,
green jasper, amethyst, lapis lazuli, opal, granite, and blue-green
china. None of these things happily were touched.  The bullet had gone
through the back of the cabinet; but no other damage, save the
shattering of the glass, had been done.  I could not but notice the
strange arrangement of the curios on the shelf of the cabinet.  All the
scarabs, rings, amulets, &c. were arranged in an uneven oval round an
exquisitely-carved golden miniature figure of a hawk-headed God crowned
with a disk and plumes.  I did not wait to look further at present, for
my attention was demanded by more pressing things; but I determined to
make a more minute examination when I should have time.  It was evident
that some of the strange Egyptian smell clung to these old curios;
through the broken glass came an added whiff of spice and gum and
bitumen, almost stronger than those I had already noticed as coming
from others in the room.

All this had really taken but a few minutes.  I was surprised when my
eye met, through the chinks between the dark window blinds and the
window cases, the brighter light of the coming dawn.  When I went back
to the sofa and took the tourniquet from Mrs. Grant, she went over and
pulled up the blinds.

It would be hard to imagine anything more ghastly than the appearance
of the room with the faint grey light of early morning coming in upon
it. As the windows faced north, any light that came was a fixed grey
light without any of the rosy possibility of dawn which comes in the
eastern quarter of heaven.  The electric lights seemed dull and yet
glaring; and every shadow was of a hard intensity.  There was nothing
of morning freshness; nothing of the softness of night.  All was hard
and cold and inexpressibly dreary.  The face of the senseless man on
the sofa seemed of a ghastly yellow; and the Nurse's face had taken a
suggestion of green from the shade of the lamp near her.  Only Miss
Trelawny's face looked white; and it was of a pallor which made my
heart ache.  It looked as if nothing on God's earth could ever again
bring back to it the colour of life and happiness.

It was a relief to us all when Doctor Winchester came in, breathless
with running.  He only asked one question:

"Can anyone tell me anything of how this wound was gotten?"  On seeing
the headshake which went round us under his glance, he said no more,
but applied himself to his surgical work.  For an instant he looked up
at the Nurse sitting so still; but then bent himself to his task, a
grave frown contracting his brows.  It was not till the arteries were
tied and the wounds completely dressed that he spoke again, except, of
course, when he had asked for anything to be handed to him or to be
done for him.  When Mr. Trelawny's wounds had been thoroughly cared
for, he said to Miss Trelawny:

"What about Nurse Kennedy?"  She answered at once:

"I really do not know.  I found her when I came into the room at
half-past two o'clock, sitting exactly as she does now.  We have not
moved her, or changed her position.  She has not wakened since.  Even
Sergeant Daw's pistol-shots did not disturb her."

"Pistol-shots?  Have you then discovered any cause for this new
outrage?"  The rest were silent, so I answered:

"We have discovered nothing.  I was in the room watching with the
Nurse. Earlier in the evening I fancied that the mummy smells were
making me drowsy, so I went out and got a respirator.  I had it on when
I came on duty; but it did not keep me from going to sleep.  I awoke to
see the room full of people; that is, Miss Trelawny and Sergeant Daw,
being only half awake and still stupefied by the same scent or
influence which had affected us, fancied that he saw something moving
through the shadowy darkness of the room, and fired twice.  When I rose
out of my chair, with my face swathed in the respirator, he took me for
the cause of the trouble.  Naturally enough, he was about to fire
again, when I was fortunately in time to manifest my identity.  Mr.
Trelawny was lying beside the safe, just as he was found last night;
and was bleeding profusely from the new wound in his wrist.  We lifted
him on the sofa, and made a tourniquet.  That is, literally and
absolutely, all that any of us know as yet.  We have not touched the
knife, which you see lies close by the pool of blood. Look!" I said,
going over and lifting it. "The point is red with the blood which has
dried."

Doctor Winchester stood quite still a few minutes before speaking:

"Then the doings of this night are quite as mysterious as those of last
night?"

"Quite!" I answered.  He said nothing in reply, but turning to Miss
Trelawny said:

"We had better take Nurse Kennedy into another room.  I suppose there
is nothing to prevent it?"

"Nothing!  Please, Mrs. Grant, see that Nurse Kennedy's room is ready;
and ask two of the men to come and carry her in."  Mrs. Grant went out
immediately; and in a few minutes came back saying:

"The room is quite ready; and the men are here."  By her direction two
footmen came into the room and, lifting up the rigid body of Nurse
Kennedy under the supervision of the Doctor, carried her out of the
room.  Miss Trelawny remained with me in the sick chamber, and Mrs.
Grant went with the Doctor into the Nurse's room.

When we were alone Miss Trelawny came over to me, and taking both my
hands in hers, said:

"I hope you won't remember what I said.  I did not mean it, and I was
distraught."  I did not make reply; but I held her hands and kissed
them.  There are different ways of kissing a lady's hands.  This way
was intended as homage and respect; and it was accepted as such in the
high-bred, dignified way which marked Miss Trelawny's bearing and every
movement.  I went over to the sofa and looked down at the senseless
man. The dawn had come much nearer in the last few minutes, and there
was something of the clearness of day in the light.  As I looked at the
stern, cold, set face, now as white as a marble monument in the pale
grey light, I could not but feel that there was some deep mystery
beyond all that had happened within the last twenty-six hours.  Those
beetling brows screened some massive purpose; that high, broad forehead
held some finished train of reasoning, which the broad chin and massive
jaw would help to carry into effect.  As I looked and wondered, there
began to steal over me again that phase of wandering thought which had
last night heralded the approach of sleep.  I resisted it, and held
myself sternly to the present.  This was easier to do when Miss
Trelawny came close to me, and, leaning her forehead against my
shoulder, began to cry silently.  Then all the manhood in me woke, and
to present purpose.  It was of little use trying to speak; words were
inadequate to thought. But we understood each other; she did not draw
away when I put arm protectingly over her shoulder as I used to do with
my little sister long ago when in her childish trouble she would come
to her big brother to be comforted.  That very act or attitude of
protection made me more resolute in my purpose, and seemed to clear my
brain of idle, dreamy wandering in thought.  With an instinct of
greater protection, however, I took away my arm as I heard the Doctor's
footstep outside the door.

When Doctor Winchester came in he looked intently at the patient before
speaking. His brows were set, and his mouth was a thin, hard line.
Presently he said:

"There is much in common between the sleep of your Father and Nurse
Kennedy. Whatever influence has brought it about has probably worked
the same way in both cases.  In Kennedy's case the coma is less marked.
I cannot but feel, however, that with her we may be able to do more and
more quickly than with this patient, as our hands are not tied.  I have
placed her in a draught; and already she shows some signs, though very
faint ones, of ordinary unconsciousness.  The rigidity of her limbs is
less, and her skin seems more sensitive--or perhaps I should say less
insensitive--to pain."

"How is it, then," I asked, "that Mr. Trelawny is still in this state
of insensibility; and yet, so far as we know, his body has not had such
rigidity at all?"

"That I cannot answer.  The problem is one which we may solve in a few
hours; or it may need a few days.  But it will be a useful lesson in
diagnosis to us all; and perhaps to many and many others after us, who
knows!" he added, with the genuine fire of an enthusiast.

As the morning wore on, he flitted perpetually between the two rooms,
watching anxiously over both patients.  He made Mrs. Grant remain with
the Nurse, but either Miss Trelawny or I, generally both of us,
remained with the wounded man. We each managed, however, to get bathed
and dressed; the Doctor and Mrs. Grant remained with Mr. Trelawny
whilst we had breakfast.

Sergeant Daw went off to report at Scotland Yard the progress of the
night; and then to the local station to arrange for the coming of his
comrade, Wright, as fixed with Superintendent Dolan.  When he returned
I could not but think that he had been hauled over the coals for
shooting in a sick-room; or perhaps for shooting at all without certain
and proper cause.  His remark to me enlightened me in the matter:

"A good character is worth something, sir, in spite of what some of
them say.  See! I've still got leave to carry my revolver."

That day was a long and anxious one.  Toward nightfall Nurse Kennedy so
far improved that the rigidity of her limbs entirely disappeared.  She
still breathed quietly and regularly; but the fixed expression of her
face, though it was a calm enough expression, gave place to fallen
eyelids and the negative look of sleep. Doctor Winchester had, towards
evening, brought two more nurses, one of whom was to remain with Nurse
Kennedy and the other to share in the watching with Miss Trelawny, who
had insisted on remaining up herself.  She had, in order to prepare for
the duty, slept for several hours in the afternoon.  We had all taken
counsel together, and had arranged thus for the watching in Mr.
Trelawny's room.  Mrs. Grant was to remain beside the patient till
twelve, when Miss Trelawny would relieve her.  The new nurse was to sit
in Miss Trelawny's room, and to visit the sick chamber each quarter of
an hour.  The Doctor would remain till twelve; when I was to relieve
him.  One or other of the detectives was to remain within hail of the
room all night; and to pay periodical visits to see that all was well.
Thus, the watchers would be watched; and the possibility of such events
as last night, when the watchers were both overcome, would be avoided.

When the sun set, a strange and grave anxiety fell on all of us; and in
our separate ways we prepared for the vigil.  Doctor Winchester had
evidently been thinking of my respirator, for he told me he would go
out and get one.  Indeed, he took to the idea so kindly that I
persuaded Miss Trelawny also to have one which she could put on when
her time for watching came.

And so the night drew on.




Chapter V

More Strange Instructions


When I came from my room at half-past eleven o'clock I found all well
in the sick-room.  The new nurse, prim, neat, and watchful, sat in the
chair by the bedside where Nurse Kennedy had sat last night.  A little
way off, between the bed and the safe, sat Dr. Winchester alert and
wakeful, but looking strange and almost comic with the respirator over
mouth and nose.  As I stood in the doorway looking at them I heard a
slight sound; turning round I saw the new detective, who nodded, held
up the finger of silence and withdrew quietly.  Hitherto no one of the
watchers was overcome by sleep.

I took a chair outside the door.  As yet there was no need for me to
risk coming again under the subtle influence of last night.  Naturally
my thoughts went revolving round the main incidents of the last day and
night, and I found myself arriving at strange conclusions, doubts,
conjectures; but I did not lose myself, as on last night, in trains of
thought.  The sense of the present was ever with me, and I really felt
as should a sentry on guard.  Thinking is not a slow process; and when
it is earnest the time can pass quickly.  It seemed a very short time
indeed till the door, usually left ajar, was pulled open and Dr.
Winchester emerged, taking off his respirator as he came.  His act,
when he had it off, was demonstrative of his keenness.  He turned up
the outside of the wrap and smelled it carefully.

"I am going now," he said.  "I shall come early in the morning; unless,
of course, I am sent for before.  But all seems well tonight."

The next to appear was Sergeant Daw, who went quietly into the room and
took the seat vacated by the Doctor.  I still remained outside; but
every few minutes looked into the room.  This was rather a form than a
matter of utility, for the room was so dark that coming even from the
dimly-lighted corridor it was hard to distinguish anything.

A little before twelve o'clock Miss Trelawny came from her room.
Before coming to her father's she went into that occupied by Nurse
Kennedy. After a couple of minutes she came out, looking, I thought, a
trifle more cheerful.  She had her respirator in her hand, but before
putting it on, asked me if anything special had occurred since she had
gone to lie down.  I answered in a whisper--there was no loud talking
in the house tonight--that all was safe, was well.  She then put on her
respirator, and I mine; and we entered the room.  The Detective and the
Nurse rose up, and we took their places.  Sergeant Daw was the last to
go out; he closed the door behind him as we had arranged.

For a while I sat quiet, my heart beating.  The place was grimly dark.
The only light was a faint one from the top of the lamp which threw a
white circle on the high ceiling, except the emerald sheen of the shade
as the light took its under edges. Even the light only seemed to
emphasize the blackness of the shadows.  These presently began to seem,
as on last night, to have a sentience of their own.  I did not myself
feel in the least sleepy; and each time I went softly over to look at
the patient, which I did about every ten minutes, I could see that Miss
Trelawny was keenly alert.  Every quarter of an hour one or other of
the policemen looked in through the partly opened door.  Each time both
Miss Trelawny and I said through our mufflers, "all right," and the
door was closed again.

As the time wore on, the silence and the darkness seemed to increase.
The circle of light on the ceiling was still there, but it seemed less
brilliant than at first.  The green edging of the lamp-shade became
like Maori greenstone rather than emerald. The sounds of the night
without the house, and the starlight spreading pale lines along the
edges of the window-cases, made the pall of black within more solemn
and more mysterious.

We heard the clock in the corridor chiming the quarters with its silver
bell till two o'clock; and then a strange feeling came over me.  I
could see from Miss Trelawny's movement as she looked round, that she
also had some new sensation.  The new detective had just looked in; we
two were alone with the unconscious patient for another quarter of an
hour.

My heart began to beat wildly.  There was a sense of fear over me.  Not
for myself; my fear was impersonal.  It seemed as though some new
person had entered the room, and that a strong intelligence was awake
close to me.  Something brushed against my leg.  I put my hand down
hastily and touched the furry coat of Silvio. With a very faint
far-away sound of a snarl he turned and scratched at me.  I felt blood
on my hand.  I rose gently and came over to the bedside.  Miss
Trelawny, too, had stood up and was looking behind her, as though there
was something close to her. Her eyes were wild, and her breast rose and
fell as though she were fighting for air. When I touched her she did
not seem to feel me; she worked her hands in front of her, as though
she was fending off something.

There was not an instant to lose.  I seized her in my arms and rushed
over to the door, threw it open, and strode into the passage, calling
loudly:

"Help!  Help!"

In an instant the two Detectives, Mrs. Grant, and the Nurse appeared on
the scene. Close on their heels came several of the servants, both men
and women. Immediately Mrs. Grant came near enough, I placed Miss
Trelawny in her arms, and rushed back into the room, turning up the
electric light as soon as I could lay my hand on it.  Sergeant Daw and
the Nurse followed me.

We were just in time.  Close under the great safe, where on the two
successive nights he had been found, lay Mr. Trelawny with his left
arm, bare save for the bandages, stretched out.  Close by his side was
a leaf-shaped Egyptian knife which had lain amongst the curios on the
shelf of the broken cabinet.  Its point was stuck in the parquet floor,
whence had been removed the blood-stained rug.

But there was no sign of disturbance anywhere; nor any sign of any one
or anything unusual.  The Policemen and I searched the room accurately,
whilst the Nurse and two of the servants lifted the wounded man back to
bed; but no sign or clue could we get.  Very soon Miss Trelawny
returned to the room.  She was pale but collected. When she came close
to me she said in a low voice:

"I felt myself fainting.  I did not know why; but I was afraid!"

The only other shock I had was when Miss Trelawny cried out to me, as I
placed my hand on the bed to lean over and look carefully at her father:

"You are wounded.  Look! look! your hand is bloody.  There is blood on
the sheets!" I had, in the excitement, quite forgotten Silvio's
scratch. As I looked at it, the recollection came back to me; but
before I could say a word Miss Trelawny had caught hold of my hand and
lifted it up. When she saw the parallel lines of the cuts she cried out
again:

"It is the same wound as Father's!"  Then she laid my hand down gently
but quickly, and said to me and to Sergeant Daw:

"Come to my room!  Silvio is there in his basket."  We followed her,
and found Silvio sitting in his basket awake.  He was licking his paws.
The Detective said:

"He is there sure enough; but why licking his paws?"

Margaret--Miss Trelawny--gave a moan as she bent over and took one of
the forepaws in her hand; but the cat seemed to resent it and snarled.
At that Mrs. Grant came into the room.  When she saw that we were
looking at the cat she said:

"The Nurse tells me that Silvio was asleep on Nurse Kennedy's bed ever
since you went to your Father's room until a while ago.  He came there
just after you had gone to master's room.  Nurse says that Nurse
Kennedy is moaning and muttering in her sleep as though she had a
nightmare.  I think we should send for Dr. Winchester."

"Do so at once, please!" said Miss Trelawny; and we went back to the
room.

For a while Miss Trelawny stood looking at her father, with her brows
wrinkled. Then, turning to me, as though her mind were made up, she
said:

"Don't you think we should have a consultation on Father?  Of course I
have every confidence in Doctor Winchester; he seems an immensely
clever young man.  But he is a young man; and there must be men who
have devoted themselves to this branch of science.  Such a man would
have more knowledge and more experience; and his knowledge and
experience might help to throw light on poor Father's case. As it is,
Doctor Winchester seems to be quite in the dark.  Oh! I don't know what
to do. It is all so terrible!"  Here she broke down a little and cried;
and I tried to comfort her.

Doctor Winchester arrived quickly.  His first thought was for his
patient; but when he found him without further harm, he visited Nurse
Kennedy.  When he saw her, a hopeful look came into his eyes.  Taking a
towel, he dipped a corner of it in cold water and flicked on the face.
The skin coloured, and she stirred slightly.  He said to the new
nurse--Sister Doris he called her:

"She is all right.  She will wake in a few hours at latest.  She may be
dizzy and distraught at first, or perhaps hysterical.  If so, you know
how to treat her."

"Yes, sir!" answered Sister Doris demurely; and we went back to Mr.
Trelawny's room. As soon as we had entered, Mrs. Grant and the Nurse
went out so that only Doctor Winchester, Miss Trelawny, and myself
remained in the room.  When the door had been closed Doctor Winchester
asked me as to what had occurred.  I told him fully, giving exactly
every detail so far as I could remember.  Throughout my narrative,
which did not take long, however, he kept asking me questions as to who
had been present and the order in which each one had come into the
room.  He asked other things, but nothing of any importance; these were
all that took my attention, or remained in my memory.  When our
conversation was finished, he said in a very decided way indeed, to
Miss Trelawny:

"I think, Miss Trelawny, that we had better have a consultation on this
case."  She answered at once, seemingly a little to his surprise:

"I am glad you have mentioned it.  I quite agree.  Who would you
suggest?"

"Have you any choice yourself?" he asked.  "Any one to whom your Father
is known? Has he ever consulted any one?"

"Not to my knowledge.  But I hope you will choose whoever you think
would be best.  My dear Father should have all the help that can be
had; and I shall be deeply obliged by your choosing.  Who is the best
man in London--anywhere else--in such a case?"

"There are several good men; but they are scattered all over the world.
Somehow, the brain specialist is born, not made; though a lot of hard
work goes to the completing of him and fitting him for his work.  He
comes from no country.  The most daring investigator up to the present
is Chiuni, the Japanese; but he is rather a surgical experimentalist
than a practitioner.  Then there is Zammerfest of Uppsala, and Fenelon
of the University of Paris, and Morfessi of Naples.  These, of course,
are in addition to our own men, Morrison of Aberdeen and Richardson of
Birmingham. But before them all I would put Frere of King's College.
Of all that I have named he best unites theory and practice.  He has no
hobbies--that have been discovered at all events; and his experience is
immense.  It is the regret of all of us who admire him that the nerve
so firm and the hand so dexterous must yield to time.  For my own part
I would rather have Frere than any one living."

"Then," said Miss Trelawny decisively, "let us have Doctor Frere--by
the way, is he 'Doctor' or 'Mister'?--as early as we can get him in the
morning!"

A weight seemed removed from him, and he spoke with greater ease and
geniality than he had yet shown:

"He is Sir James Frere.  I shall go to him myself as early as it is
possibly to see him, and shall ask him to come here at once."  Then
turning to me he said:

"You had better let me dress your hand."

"It is nothing," I said.

"Nevertheless it should be seen to.  A scratch from any animal might
turn out dangerous; there is nothing like being safe."  I submitted;
forthwith he began to dress my hand.  He examined with a
magnifying-glass the several parallel wounds, and compared them with
the slip of blotting-paper, marked with Silvio's claws, which he took
from his pocket-book.  He put back the paper, simply remarking:

"It's a pity that Silvio slips in--and out--just when he shouldn't."

The morning wore slowly on.  By ten o'clock Nurse Kennedy had so far
recovered that she was able to sit up and talk intelligibly.  But she
was still hazy in her thoughts; and could not remember anything that
had happened on the previous night, after her taking her place by the
sick-bed.  As yet she seemed neither to know nor care what had happened.

It was nearly eleven o'clock when Doctor Winchester returned with Sir
James Frere. Somehow I felt my heart sink when from the landing I saw
them in the hall below; I knew that Miss Trelawny was to have the pain
of telling yet another stranger of her ignorance of her father's life.

Sir James Frere was a man who commanded attention followed by respect.
He knew so thoroughly what he wanted himself, that he placed at once on
one side all wishes and ideas of less definite persons.  The mere flash
of his piercing eyes, or the set of his resolute mouth, or the lowering
of his great eyebrows, seemed to compel immediate and willing obedience
to his wishes.  Somehow, when we had all been introduced and he was
well amongst us, all sense of mystery seemed to melt away.  It was with
a hopeful spirit that I saw him pass into the sick-room with Doctor
Winchester.

They remained in the room a long time; once they sent for the Nurse,
the new one, Sister Doris, but she did not remain long.  Again they
both went into Nurse Kennedy's room.  He sent out the nurse attendant
on her. Doctor Winchester told me afterward that Nurse Kennedy, though
she was ignorant of later matters, gave full and satisfactory answers
to all Doctor Frere's questions relating to her patient up to the time
she became unconscious.  Then they went to the study, where they
remained so long, and their voices raised in heated discussion seemed
in such determined opposition, that I began to feel uneasy.  As for
Miss Trelawny, she was almost in a state of collapse from nervousness
before they joined us.  Poor girl! she had had a sadly anxious time of
it, and her nervous strength had almost broken down.

They came out at last, Sir James first, his grave face looking as
unenlightening as that of the sphinx.  Doctor Winchester followed him
closely; his face was pale, but with that kind of pallor which looked
like a reaction.  It gave me the idea that it had been red not long
before.  Sir James asked that Miss Trelawny would come into the study.
He suggested that I should come also.  When we had entered, Sir James
turned to me and said:

"I understand from Doctor Winchester that you are a friend of Miss
Trelawny, and that you have already considerable knowledge of this
case. Perhaps it will be well that you should be with us.  I know you
already as a keen lawyer, Mr. Ross, though I never had the pleasure of
meeting you.  As Doctor Winchester tells me that there are some strange
matters outside this case which seem to puzzle him--and others--and in
which he thinks you may yet be specially interested, it might be as
well that you should know every phase of the case.  For myself I do not
take much account of mysteries--except those of science; and as there
seems to be some idea of an attempt at assassination or robbery, all I
can say is that if assassins were at work they ought to take some
elementary lessons in anatomy before their next job, for they seem
thoroughly ignorant.  If robbery were their purpose, they seem to have
worked with marvellous inefficiency.  That, however, is not my
business."  Here he took a big pinch of snuff, and turning to to Miss
Trelawny, went on: "Now as to the patient. Leaving out the cause of his
illness, all we can say at present is that he appears to be suffering
from a marked attack of catalepsy.  At present nothing can be done,
except to sustain his strength.  The treatment of my friend Doctor
Winchester is mainly such as I approve of; and I am confident that
should any slight change arise he will be able to deal with it
satisfactorily.  It is an interesting case--most interesting; and
should any new or abnormal development arise I shall be happy to come
at any time.  There is just one thing to which I wish to call your
attention; and I put it to you, Miss Trelawny, directly, since it is
your responsibility.  Doctor Winchester informs me that you are not
yourself free in the matter, but are bound by an instruction given by
your Father in case just such a condition of things should arise.  I
would strongly advise that the patient be removed to another room; or,
as an alternative, that those mummies and all such things should be
removed from his chamber.  Why, it's enough to put any man into an
abnormal condition, to have such an assemblage of horrors round him,
and to breathe the atmosphere which they exhale.  You have evidence
already of how such mephitic odour may act.  That nurse--Kennedy, I
think you said, Doctor--isn't yet out of her state of catalepsy; and
you, Mr. Ross, have, I am told, experienced something of the same
effects.  I know this"--here his eyebrows came down more than ever, and
his mouth hardened--"if I were in charge here I should insist on the
patient having a different atmosphere; or I would throw up the case.
Doctor Winchester already knows that I can only be again consulted on
this condition being fulfilled.  But I trust that you will see your
way, as a good daughter to my mind should, to looking to your Father's
health and sanity rather than to any whim of his--whether supported or
not by a foregoing fear, or by any number of "penny dreadful"
mysteries.  The day has hardly come yet, I am glad to say, when the
British Museum and St. Thomas's Hospital have exchanged their normal
functions.  Good-day, Miss Trelawny.  I earnestly hope that I may soon
see your Father restored.  Remember, that should you fulfil the
elementary condition which I have laid down, I am at your service day
or night.  Good-morning, Mr. Ross.  I hope you will be able to report
to me soon, Doctor Winchester."

When he had gone we stood silent, till the rumble of his carriage
wheels died away. The first to speak was Doctor Winchester:

"I think it well to say that to my mind, speaking purely as a
physician, he is quite right.  I feel as if I could have assaulted him
when he made it a condition of not giving up the case; but all the same
he is right as to treatment.  He does not understand that there is
something odd about this special case; and he will not realise the knot
that we are all tied up in by Mr. Trelawny's instructions.  Of
course--" He was interrupted by Miss Trelawny:

"Doctor Winchester, do you, too, wish to give up the case; or are you
willing to continue it under the conditions you know?"

"Give it up!  Less now than ever.  Miss Trelawny, I shall never give it
up, so long as life is left to him or any of us!"  She said nothing,
but held out her hand, which he took warmly.

"Now," said she, "if Sir James Frere is a type of the cult of
Specialists, I want no more of them.  To start with, he does not seem
to know any more than you do about my Father's condition; and if he
were a hundredth part as much interested in it as you are, he would not
stand on such punctilio.  Of course, I am only too anxious about my
poor Father; and if I can see a way to meet either of Sir James Frere's
conditions, I shall do so.  I shall ask Mr. Marvin to come here today,
and advise me as to the limit of Father's wishes.  If he thinks I am
free to act in any way on my own responsibility, I shall not hesitate
to do so."  Then Doctor Winchester took his leave.

Miss Trelawny sat down and wrote a letter to Mr. Marvin, telling him of
the state of affairs, and asking him to come and see her and to bring
with him any papers which might throw any light on the subject.  She
sent the letter off with a carriage to bring back the solicitor; we
waited with what patience we could for his coming.

It is not a very long journey for oneself from Kensington Palace
Gardens to Lincoln's Inn Fields; but it seemed endlessly long when
waiting for someone else to take it.  All things, however, are amenable
to Time; it was less than an hour all told when Mr. Marvin was with us.

He recognised Miss Trelawny's impatience, and when he had learned
sufficient of her father's illness, he said to her:

"Whenever you are ready I can go with you into particulars regarding
your Father's wishes."

"Whenever you like," she said, with an evident ignorance of his
meaning. "Why not now?"  He looked at me, as to a fellow man of
business, and stammered out:

"We are not alone."

"I have brought Mr. Ross here on purpose," she answered.  "He knows so
much at present, that I want him to know more."  The solicitor was a
little disconcerted, a thing which those knowing him only in courts
would hardly have believed.  He answered, however, with some hesitation:

"But, my dear young lady--Your Father's wishes!--Confidence between
father and child--"

Here she interrupted him; there was a tinge of red in her pale cheeks
as she did so:

"Do you really think that applies to the present circumstances, Mr.
Marvin?  My Father never told me anything of his affairs; and I can
now, in this sad extremity, only learn his wishes through a gentleman
who is a stranger to me and of whom I never even heard till I got my
Father's letter, written to be shown to me only in extremity.  Mr. Ross
is a new friend; but he has all my confidence, and I should like him to
be present.  Unless, of course," she added, "such a thing is forbidden
by my Father.  Oh! forgive me, Mr. Marvin, if I seem rude; but I have
been in such dreadful trouble and anxiety lately, that I have hardly
command of myself."  She covered her eyes with her hand for a few
seconds; we two men looked at each other and waited, trying to appear
unmoved.  She went on more firmly; she had recovered herself:

"Please! please do not think I am ungrateful to you for your kindness
in coming here and so quickly.  I really am grateful; and I have every
confidence in your judgment.  If you wish, or think it best, we can be
alone."  I stood up; but Mr. Marvin made a dissentient gesture.  He was
evidently pleased with her attitude; there was geniality in his voice
and manner as he spoke:

"Not at all!  Not at all!  There is no restriction on your Father's
part; and on my own I am quite willing.  Indeed, all told, it may be
better.  From what you have said of Mr. Trelawny's illness, and the
other--incidental--matters, it will be well in case of any grave
eventuality, that it was understood from the first, that circumstances
were ruled by your Father's own imperative instructions.  For, please
understand me, his instructions are imperative--most imperative.  They
are so unyielding that he has given me a Power of Attorney, under which
I have undertaken to act, authorising me to see his written wishes
carried out.  Please believe me once for all, that he intended fully
everything mentioned in that letter to you!  Whilst he is alive he is
to remain in his own room; and none of his property is to be removed
from it under any circumstances whatever.  He has even given an
inventory of the articles which are not to be displaced."

Miss Trelawny was silent.  She looked somewhat distressed; so, thinking
that I understood the immediate cause, I asked:

"May we see the list?"  Miss Trelawny's face at once brightened; but it
fell again as the lawyer answered promptly--he was evidently prepared
for the question:

"Not unless I am compelled to take action on the Power of Attorney.  I
have brought that instrument with me.  You will recognise, Mr.
Ross"--he said this with a sort of business conviction which I had
noticed in his professional work, as he handed me the deed--"how
strongly it is worded, and how the grantor made his wishes apparent in
such a way as to leave no loophole.  It is his own wording, except for
certain legal formalities; and I assure you I have seldom seen a more
iron-clad document.  Even I myself have no power to make the slightest
relaxation of the instructions, without committing a distinct breach of
faith.  And that, I need not tell you, is impossible." He evidently
added the last words in order to prevent an appeal to his personal
consideration.  He did not like the seeming harshness of his words,
however, for he added:

"I do hope, Miss Trelawny, that you understand that I am
willing--frankly and unequivocally willing--to do anything I can,
within the limits of my power, to relieve your distress.  But your
Father had, in all his doings, some purpose of his own which he did not
disclose to me. So far as I can see, there is not a word of his
instructions that he had not thought over fully.  Whatever idea he had
in his mind was the idea of a lifetime; he had studied it in every
possible phase, and was prepared to guard it at every point.

"Now I fear I have distressed you, and I am truly sorry for it; for I
see you have much--too much--to bear already.  But I have no
alternative. If you want to consult me at any time about anything, I
promise you I will come without a moment's delay, at any hour of the
day or night. There is my private address," he scribbled in his
pocket-book as he spoke, "and under it the address of my club, where I
am generally to be found in the evening."  He tore out the paper and
handed it to her.  She thanked him.  He shook hands with her and with
me and withdrew.

As soon as the hall door was shut on him, Mrs. Grant tapped at the door
and came in. There was such a look of distress in her face that Miss
Trelawny stood up, deadly white, and asked her:

"What is it, Mrs. Grant?  What is it?  Any new trouble?"

"I grieve to say, miss, that the servants, all but two, have given
notice and want to leave the house today.  They have talked the matter
over among themselves; the butler has spoken for the rest.  He says as
how they are willing to forego their wages, and even to pay their legal
obligations instead of notice; but that go today they must."

"What reason do they give?"

"None, miss.  They say as how they're sorry, but that they've nothing
to say.  I asked Jane, the upper housemaid, miss, who is not with the
rest but stops on; and she tells me confidential that they've got some
notion in their silly heads that the house is haunted!"

We ought to have laughed, but we didn't.  I could not look in Miss
Trelawny's face and laugh.  The pain and horror there showed no sudden
paroxysm of fear; there was a fixed idea of which this was a
confirmation.  For myself, it seemed as if my brain had found a voice.
But the voice was not complete; there was some other thought, darker
and deeper, which lay behind it, whose voice had not sounded as yet.




Chapter VI

Suspicions


The first to get full self-command was Miss Trelawny.  There was a
haughty dignity in her bearing as she said:

"Very well, Mrs. Grant; let them go!  Pay them up to today, and a
month's wages. They have hitherto been very good servants; and the
occasion of their leaving is not an ordinary one.  We must not expect
much faithfulness from any one who is beset with fears.  Those who
remain are to have in future double wages; and please send these to me
presently when I send word."  Mrs. Grant bristled with smothered
indignation; all the housekeeper in her was outraged by such generous
treatment of servants who had combined to give notice:

"They don't deserve it, miss; them to go on so, after the way they have
been treated here.  Never in my life have I seen servants so well
treated or anyone so good to them and gracious to them as you have
been. They might be in the household of a King for treatment.  And now,
just as there is trouble, to go and act like this.  It's abominable,
that's what it is!"

Miss Trelawny was very gentle with her, and smothered her ruffled
dignity; so that presently she went away with, in her manner, a lesser
measure of hostility to the undeserving.  In quite a different frame of
mind she returned presently to ask if her mistress would like her to
engage a full staff of other servants, or at any rate try to do so.
"For you know, ma'am," she went on, "when once a scare has been
established in the servants' hall, it's wellnigh impossible to get rid
of it.  Servants may come; but they go away just as quick.  There's no
holding them.  They simply won't stay; or even if they work out their
month's notice, they lead you that life that you wish every hour of the
day that you hadn't kept them.  The women are bad enough, the huzzies;
but the men are worse!"  There was neither anxiety nor indignation in
Miss Trelawny's voice or manner as she said:

"I think, Mrs. Grant, we had better try to do with those we have.
Whilst my dear Father is ill we shall not be having any company, so
that there will be only three now in the house to attend to.  If those
servants who are willing to stay are not enough, I should only get
sufficient to help them to do the work.  It will not, I should think,
be difficult to get a few maids; perhaps some that you know already.
And please bear in mind, that those whom you get, and who are suitable
and will stay, are henceforth to have the same wages as those who are
remaining.  Of course, Mrs. Grant, you well enough understand that
though I do not group you in any way with the servants, the rule of
double salary applies to you too."  As she spoke she extended her long,
fine-shaped hand, which the other took and then, raising it to her
lips, kissed it impressively with the freedom of an elder woman to a
younger. I could not but admire the generosity of her treatment of her
servants. In my mind I endorsed Mrs. Grant's sotto voce remark as she
left the room:

"No wonder the house is like a King's house, when the mistress is a
Princess!"

"A Princess!"  That was it.  The idea seemed to satisfy my mind, and to
bring back in a wave of light the first moment when she swept across my
vision at the ball in Belgrave Square.  A queenly figure! tall and
slim, bending, swaying, undulating as the lily or the lotos.  Clad in a
flowing gown of some filmy black material shot with gold. For ornament
in her hair she wore an old Egyptian jewel, a tiny crystal disk, set
between rising plumes carved in lapis lazuli.  On her wrist was a broad
bangle or bracelet of antique work, in the shape of a pair of spreading
wings wrought in gold, with the feathers made of coloured gems.  For
all her gracious bearing toward me, when our hostess introduced me, I
was then afraid of her.  It was only when later, at the picnic on the
river, I had come to realise her sweet and gentle, that my awe changed
to something else.

For a while she sat, making some notes or memoranda.  Then putting them
away, she sent for the faithful servants.  I thought that she had
better have this interview alone, and so left her.  When I came back
there were traces of tears in her eyes.

The next phase in which I had a part was even more disturbing, and
infinitely more painful.  Late in the afternoon Sergeant Daw came into
the study where I was sitting. After closing the door carefully and
looking all round the room to make certain that we were alone, he came
close to me.

"What is it?" I asked him.  "I see you wish to speak to me privately."

"Quite so, sir!  May I speak in absolute confidence?"

"Of course you may.  In anything that is for the good of Miss
Trelawny--and of course Mr. Trelawny--you may be perfectly frank.  I
take it that we both want to serve them to the best of our powers."  He
hesitated before replying:

"Of course you know that I have my duty to do; and I think you know me
well enough to know that I will do it.  I am a policeman--a detective;
and it is my duty to find out the facts of any case I am put on,
without fear or favour to anyone.  I would rather speak to you alone,
in confidence if I may, without reference to any duty of anyone to
anyone, except mine to Scotland Yard."

"Of course! of course!" I answered mechanically, my heart sinking, I
did not know why.  "Be quite frank with me.  I assure you of my
confidence."

"Thank you, sir.  I take it that what I say is not to pass beyond
you--not to anyone. Not to Miss Trelawny herself, or even to Mr.
Trelawny when he becomes well again."

"Certainly, if you make it a condition!" I said a little more stiffly.
The man recognised the change in my voice or manner, and said
apologetically:

"Excuse me, sir, but I am going outside my duty in speaking to you at
all on the subject.  I know you, however, of old; and I feel that I can
trust you.  Not your word, sir, that is all right; but your discretion!"

I bowed.  "Go on!" I said.  He began at once:

"I have gone over this case, sir, till my brain begins to reel; but I
can't find any ordinary solution of it.  At the time of each attempt no
one has seemingly come into the house; and certainly no one has got
out. What does it strike you is the inference?"

"That the somebody--or the something--was in the house already," I
answered, smiling in spite of myself.

"That's just what I think," he said, with a manifest sigh of relief.
"Very well! Who can be that someone?"

"'Someone, or something,' was what I said," I answered.

"Let us make it 'someone,' Mr. Ross!  That cat, though he might have
scratched or bit, never pulled the old gentleman out of bed, and tried
to get the bangle with the key off his arm.  Such things are all very
well in books where your amateur detectives, who know everything before
it's done, can fit them into theories; but in Scotland Yard, where the
men aren't all idiots either, we generally find that when crime is
done, or attempted, it's people, not things, that are at the bottom of
it."

"Then make it 'people' by all means, Sergeant."

"We were speaking of 'someone,' sir."

"Quite right.  Someone, be it!"

"Did it ever strike you, sir, that on each of the three separate
occasions where outrage was effected, or attempted, there was one
person who was the first to be present and to give the alarm?"

"Let me see!  Miss Trelawny, I believe, gave the alarm on the first
occasion.  I was present myself, if fast asleep, on the second; and so
was Nurse Kennedy.  When I woke there were several people in the room;
you were one of them.  I understand that on that occasion also Miss
Trelawny was before you.  At the last attempt I was Miss Trelawny
fainted.  I carried her out and went back.  In returning, I was first;
and I think you were close behind me."

Sergeant Daw thought for a moment before replying:

"She was present, or first, in the room on all the occasions; there was
only damage done in the first and second!"

The inference was one which I, as a lawyer, could not mistake.  I
thought the best thing to do was to meet it half-way.  I have always
found that the best way to encounter an inference is to cause it to be
turned into a statement.

"You mean," I said, "that as on the only occasions when actual harm was
done, Miss Trelawny's being the first to discover it is a proof that
she did it; or was in some way connected with the attempt, as well as
the discovery?"

"I didn't venture to put it as clear as that; but that is where the
doubt which I had leads."  Sergeant Daw was a man of courage; he
evidently did not shrink from any conclusion of his reasoning on facts.

We were both silent for a while.  Fears began crowding in on my own
mind.  Not doubts of Miss Trelawny, or of any act of hers; but fears
lest such acts should be misunderstood.  There was evidently a mystery
somewhere; and if no solution to it could be found, the doubt would be
cast on someone.  In such cases the guesses of the majority are bound
to follow the line of least resistance; and if it could be proved that
any personal gain to anyone could follow Mr. Trelawny's death, should
such ensue, it might prove a difficult task for anyone to prove
innocence in the face of suspicious facts.  I found myself
instinctively taking that deferential course which, until the plan of
battle of the prosecution is unfolded, is so safe an attitude for the
defence.  It would never do for me, at this stage, to combat any
theories which a detective might form. I could best help Miss Trelawny
by listening and understanding.  When the time should come for the
dissipation and obliteration of the theories, I should be quite willing
to use all my militant ardour, and all the weapons at my command.

"You will of course do your duty, I know," I said, "and without fear.
What course do you intend to take?"

"I don't know as yet, sir.  You see, up to now it isn't with me even a
suspicion.  If any one else told me that that sweet young lady had a
hand in such a matter, I would think him a fool; but I am bound to
follow my own conclusions.  I know well that just as unlikely persons
have been proved guilty, when a whole court--all except the prosecution
who knew the facts, and the judge who had taught his mind to
wait--would have sworn to innocence.  I wouldn't, for all the world,
wrong such a young lady; more especial when she has such a cruel weight
to bear.  And you will be sure that I won't say a word that'll prompt
anyone else to make such a charge.  That's why I speak to you in
confidence, man to man.  You are skilled in proofs; that is your
profession.  Mine only gets so far as suspicions, and what we call our
own proofs--which are nothing but ex parte evidence after all.  You
know Miss Trelawny better than I do; and though I watch round the
sick-room, and go where I like about the house and in and out of it, I
haven't the same opportunities as you have of knowing the lady and what
her life is, or her means are; or of anything else which might give me
a clue to her actions.  If I were to try to find out from her, it would
at once arouse her suspicions.  Then, if she were guilty, all
possibility of ultimate proof would go; for she would easily find a way
to baffle discovery.  But if she be innocent, as I hope she is, it
would be doing a cruel wrong to accuse her.  I have thought the matter
over according to my lights before I spoke to you; and if I have taken
a liberty, sir, I am truly sorry."

"No liberty in the world, Daw," I said warmly, for the man's courage
and honesty and consideration compelled respect.  "I am glad you have
spoken to me so frankly. We both want to find out the truth; and there
is so much about this case that is strange--so strange as to go beyond
all experiences--that to aim at truth is our only chance of making
anything clear in the long-run--no matter what our views are, or what
object we wish to achieve ultimately!"  The Sergeant looked pleased as
he went on:

"I thought, therefore, that if you had it once in your mind that
somebody else held to such a possibility, you would by degrees get
proof; or at any rate such ideas as would convince yourself, either for
or against it.  Then we would come to some conclusion; or at any rate
we should so exhaust all other possibilities that the most likely one
would remain as the nearest thing to proof, or strong suspicion, that
we could get. After that we should have to--"

Just at this moment the door opened and Miss Trelawny entered the room.
The moment she saw us she drew back quickly, saying:

"Oh, I beg pardon!  I did not know you were here, and engaged."  By the
time I had stood up, she was about to go back.

"Do come in," I said; "Sergeant Daw and I were only talking matters
over."

Whilst she was hesitating, Mrs. Grant appeared, saying as she entered
the room: "Doctor Winchester is come, miss, and is asking for you."

I obeyed Miss Trelawny's look; together we left the room.

When the Doctor had made his examination, he told us that there was
seemingly no change.  He added that nevertheless he would like to stay
in the house that night is he might.  Miss Trelawny looked glad, and
sent word to Mrs. Grant to get a room ready for him.  Later in the day,
when he and I happened to be alone together, he said suddenly:

"I have arranged to stay here tonight because I want to have a talk
with you.  And as I wish it to be quite private, I thought the least
suspicious way would be to have a cigar together late in the evening
when Miss Trelawny is watching her father."  We still kept to our
arrangement that either the sick man's daughter or I should be on watch
all night.  We were to share the duty at the early hours of the
morning. I was anxious about this, for I knew from our conversation
that the Detective would watch in secret himself, and would be
particularly alert about that time.

The day passed uneventfully.  Miss Trelawny slept in the afternoon; and
after dinner went to relieve the Nurse.  Mrs. Grant remained with her,
Sergeant Daw being on duty in the corridor.  Doctor Winchester and I
took our coffee in the library.  When we had lit our cigars he said
quietly:

"Now that we are alone I want to have a confidential talk.  We are
'tiled,' of course; for the present at all events?"

"Quite so!" I said, my heart sinking as I thought of my conversation
with Sergeant Daw in the morning, and of the disturbing and harrowing
fears which it had left in my mind.  He went on:

"This case is enough to try the sanity of all of us concerned in it.
The more I think of it, the madder I seem to get; and the two lines,
each continually strengthened, seem to pull harder in opposite
directions."

"What two lines?"  He looked at me keenly for a moment before replying.
Doctor Winchester's look at such moments was apt to be disconcerting.
It would have been so to me had I had a personal part, other than my
interest in Miss Trelawny, in the matter.  As it was, however, I stood
it unruffled.  I was now an attorney in the case; an amicus curiae in
one sense, in another retained for the defence.  The mere thought that
in this clever man's mind were two lines, equally strong and opposite,
was in itself so consoling as to neutralise my anxiety as to a new
attack.  As he began to speak, the Doctor's face wore an inscrutable
smile; this, however, gave place to a stern gravity as he proceeded:

"Two lines:  Fact and--Fancy!  In the first there is this whole thing;
attacks, attempts at robbery and murder; stupefyings; organised
catalepsy which points to either criminal hypnotism and thought
suggestion, or some simple form of poisoning unclassified yet in our
toxicology.  In the other there is some influence at work which is not
classified in any book that I know--outside the pages of romance.  I
never felt in my life so strongly the truth of Hamlet's words:

     'There are more things in Heaven and earth...
     Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.'

"Let us take the 'Fact' side first.  Here we have a man in his home;
amidst his own household; plenty of servants of different classes in
the house, which forbids the possibility of an organised attempt made
from the servants" hall.  He is wealthy, learned, clever.  From his
physiognomy there is no doubting that he is a man of iron will and
determined purpose.  His daughter--his only child, I take it, a young
girl bright and clever--is sleeping in the very next room to his.
There is seemingly no possible reason for expecting any attack or
disturbance of any kind; and no reasonable opportunity for any outsider
to effect it.  And yet we have an attack made; a brutal and remorseless
attack, made in the middle of the night.  Discovery is made quickly;
made with that rapidity which in criminal cases generally is found to
be not accidental, but of premeditated intent.  The attacker, or
attackers, are manifestly disturbed before the completion of their
work, whatever their ultimate intent may have been.  And yet there is
no possible sign of their escape; no clue, no disturbance of anything;
no open door or window; no sound.  Nothing whatever to show who had
done the deed, or even that a deed has been done; except the victim,
and his surroundings incidental to the deed!

"The next night a similar attempt is made, though the house is full of
wakeful people; and though there are on watch in the room and around it
a detective officer, a trained nurse, an earnest friend, and the man's
own daughter.  The nurse is thrown into a catalepsy, and the watching
friend--though protected by a respirator--into a deep sleep.  Even the
detective is so far overcome with some phase of stupor that he fires
off his pistol in the sick-room, and can't even tell what he thought he
was firing at.  That respirator of yours is the only thing that seems
to have a bearing on the 'fact' side of the affair.  That you did not
lose your head as the others did--the effect in such case being in
proportion to the amount of time each remained in the room--points to
the probability that the stupefying medium was not hypnotic, whatever
else it may have been.  But again, there is a fact which is
contradictory. Miss Trelawny, who was in the room more than any of
you--for she was in and out all the time and did her share of permanent
watching also--did not seem to be affected at all.  This would show
that the influence, whatever it is, does not affect generally--unless,
of course, it was that she was in some way inured to it.  If it should
turn out that it be some strange exhalation from some of those Egyptian
curios, that might account for it; only, we are then face to face with
the fact that Mr. Trelawny, who was most of all in the room--who, in
fact, lived more than half his life in it--was affected worst of all.
What kind of influence could it be which would account for all these
different and contradictory effects?  No! the more I think of this form
of the dilemma, the more I am bewildered!  Why, even if it were that
the attack, the physical attack, on Mr. Trelawny had been made by some
one residing in the house and not within the sphere of suspicion, the
oddness of the stupefyings would still remain a mystery.  It is not
easy to put anyone into a catalepsy.  Indeed, so far as is known yet in
science, there is no way to achieve such an object at will.  The crux
of the whole matter is Miss Trelawny, who seems to be subject to none
of the influences, or possibly of the variants of the same influence at
work.  Through all she goes unscathed, except for that one slight
semi-faint.  It is most strange!"

I listened with a sinking heart; for, though his manner was not
illuminative of distrust, his argument was disturbing.  Although it was
not so direct as the suspicion of the Detective, it seemed to single
out Miss Trelawny as different from all others concerned; and in a
mystery to be alone is to be suspected, ultimately if not immediately.
I thought it better not to say anything.  In such a case silence is
indeed golden; and if I said nothing now I might have less to defend,
or explain, or take back later.  I was, therefore, secretly glad that
his form of putting his argument did not require any answer from
me--for the present, at all events. Doctor Winchester did not seem to
expect any answer--a fact which, when I recognised it, gave my
pleasure, I hardly knew why.  He paused for a while, sitting with his
chin in his hand, his eyes staring at vacancy, whilst his brows were
fixed.  His cigar was held limp between his fingers; he had apparently
forgotten it.  In an even voice, as though commencing exactly where he
had left off, he resumed his argument:

"The other horn of the dilemma is a different affair altogether; and if
we once enter on it we must leave everything in the shape of science
and experience behind us.  I confess that it has its fascinations for
me; though at every new thought I find myself romancing in a way that
makes me pull up suddenly and look facts resolutely in the face.  I
sometimes wonder whether the influence or emanation from the sick-room
at times affects me as it did the others--the Detective, for instance.
Of course it may be that if it is anything chemical, any drug, for
example, in vaporeal form, its effects may be cumulative.  But then,
what could there be that could produce such an effect?  The room is, I
know, full of mummy smell; and no wonder, with so many relics from the
tomb, let alone the actual mummy of that animal which Silvio attacked.
By the way, I am going to test him tomorrow; I have been on the trace
of a mummy cat, and am to get possession of it in the morning.  When I
bring it here we shall find out if it be a fact that racial instinct
can survive a few thousand years in the grave.  However, to get back to
the subject in hand.  These very mummy smells arise from the presence
of substances, and combinations of substances, which the Egyptian
priests, who were the learned men and scientists of their time, found
by the experience of centuries to be strong enough to arrest the
natural forces of decay. There must be powerful agencies at work to
effect such a purpose; and it is possible that we may have here some
rare substance or combination whose qualities and powers are not
understood in this later and more prosaic age.  I wonder if Mr.
Trelawny has any knowledge, or even suspicion, of such a kind?  I only
know this for certain, that a worse atmosphere for a sick chamber could
not possibly be imagined; and I admire the courage of Sir James Frere
in refusing to have anything to do with a case under such conditions.
These instructions of Mr. Trelawny to his daughter, and from what you
have told me, the care with which he has protected his wishes through
his solicitor, show that he suspected something, at any rate. Indeed,
it would almost seem as if he expected something to happen.... I wonder
if it would be possible to learn anything about that!  Surely his
papers would show or suggest something.... It is a difficult matter to
tackle; but it might have to be done.  His present condition cannot go
on for ever; and if anything should happen there would have to be an
inquest.  In such case full examination would have to be made into
everything.... As it stands, the police evidence would show a murderous
attack more than once repeated.  As no clue is apparent, it would be
necessary to seek one in a motive."

He was silent.  The last words seemed to come in a lower and lower tone
as he went on.  It had the effect of hopelessness.  It came to me as a
conviction that now was my time to find out if he had any definite
suspicion; and as if in obedience to some command, I asked:

"Do you suspect anyone?"  He seemed in a way startled rather than
surprised as he turned his eyes on me:

"Suspect anyone?  Any thing, you mean.  I certainly suspect that there
is some influence; but at present my suspicion is held within such
limit.  Later on, if there be any sufficiently definite conclusion to
my reasoning, or my thinking--for there are not proper data for
reasoning--I may suspect; at present however--"

He stopped suddenly and looked at the door.  There was a faint sound as
the handle turned.  My own heart seemed to stand still.  There was over
me some grim, vague apprehension.  The interruption in the morning,
when I was talking with the Detective, came back upon me with a rush.

The door opened, and Miss Trelawny entered the room.

When she saw us, she started back; and a deep flush swept her face.
For a few seconds she paused; at such a time a few succeeding seconds
seem to lengthen in geometrical progression.  The strain upon me, and,
as I could easily see, on the Doctor also, relaxed as she spoke:

"Oh, forgive me, I did not know that you were engaged.  I was looking
for you, Doctor Winchester, to ask you if I might go to bed tonight
with safety, as you will be here.  I feel so tired and worn-out that I
fear I may break down; and tonight I would certainly not be of any
use."  Doctor Winchester answered heartily:

"Do!  Do go to bed by all means, and get a good night's sleep.  God
knows! you want it.  I am more than glad you have made the suggestion,
for I feared when I saw you tonight that I might have you on my hands a
patient next."

She gave a sigh of relief, and the tired look seemed to melt from her
face.  Never shall I forget the deep, earnest look in her great,
beautiful black eyes as she said to me:

"You will guard Father tonight, won't you, with Doctor Winchester?  I
am so anxious about him that every second brings new fears.  But I am
really worn-out; and if I don't get a good sleep, I think I shall go
mad.  I will change my room for tonight. I'm afraid that if I stay so
close to Father's room I shall multiply every sound into a new terror.
But, of course, you will have me waked if there be any cause.  I shall
be in the bedroom of the little suite next the boudoir off the hall.  I
had those rooms when first I came to live with Father, and I had no
care then.... It will be easier to rest there; and perhaps for a few
hours I may forget.  I shall be all right in the morning.  Good-night!"

When I had closed the door behind her and come back to the little table
at which we had been sitting, Doctor Winchester said:

"That poor girl is overwrought to a terrible degree.  I am delighted
that she is to get a rest.  It will be life to her; and in the morning
she will be all right.  Her nervous system is on the verge of a
breakdown.  Did you notice how fearfully disturbed she was, and how red
she got when she came in and found us talking?  An ordinary thing like
that, in her own house with her own guests, wouldn't under normal
circumstances disturb her!"

I was about to tell him, as an explanation in her defence, how her
entrance was a repetition of her finding the Detective and myself alone
together earlier in the day, when I remembered that that conversation
was so private that even an allusion to it might be awkward in evoking
curiosity.  So I remained silent.

We stood up to go to the sick-room; but as we took our way through the
dimly-lighted corridor I could not help thinking, again and again, and
again--ay, and for many a day after--how strange it was that she had
interrupted me on two such occasions when touching on such a theme.

There was certainly some strange web of accidents, in whose meshes we
were all involved.




Chapter VII

The Traveller's Loss


That night everything went well.  Knowing that Miss Trelawny herself
was not on guard, Doctor Winchester and I doubled our vigilance.  The
Nurses and Mrs. Grant kept watch, and the Detectives made their visit
each quarter of an hour.  All night the patient remained in his trance.
He looked healthy, and his chest rose and fell with the easy breathing
of a child.  But he never stirred; only for his breathing he might have
been of marble.  Doctor Winchester and I wore our respirators, and
irksome they were on that intolerably hot night.  Between midnight and
three o'clock I felt anxious, and had once more that creepy feeling to
which these last few nights had accustomed me; but the grey of the
dawn, stealing round the edges of the blinds, came with inexpressible
relief, followed by restfulness, went through the household.  During
the hot night my ears, strained to every sound, had been almost
painfully troubled; as though my brain or sensoria were in anxious
touch with them.  Every breath of the Nurse or the rustle of her dress;
every soft pat of slippered feet, as the Policeman went his rounds;
every moment of watching life, seemed to be a new impetus to
guardianship.  Something of the same feeling must have been abroad in
the house; now and again I could hear upstairs the sound of restless
feet, and more than once downstairs the opening of a window.  With the
coming of the dawn, however, all this ceased, and the whole household
seemed to rest. Doctor Winchester went home when Sister Doris came to
relieve Mrs. Grant.  He was, I think, a little disappointed or
chagrined that nothing of an exceptional nature had happened during his
long night vigil.

At eight o'clock Miss Trelawny joined us, and I was amazed as well as
delighted to see how much good her night's sleep had done her.  She was
fairly radiant; just as I had seen her at our first meeting and at the
picnic.  There was even a suggestion of colour in her cheeks, which,
however, looked startlingly white in contrast with her black brows and
scarlet lips.  With her restored strength, there seemed to have come a
tenderness even exceeding that which she had at first shown to her sick
father.  I could not but be moved by the loving touches as she fixed
his pillows and brushed the hair from his forehead.

I was wearied out myself with my long spell of watching; and now that
she was on guard I started off to bed, blinking my tired eyes in the
full light and feeling the weariness of a sleepless night on me all at
once.

I had a good sleep, and after lunch I was about to start out to walk to
Jermyn Street, when I noticed an importunate man at the hall door.  The
servant in charge was the one called Morris, formerly the "odd man,"
but since the exodus of the servants promoted to be butler pro tem.
The stranger was speaking rather loudly, so that there was no
difficulty in understanding his grievance.  The servant man was
respectful in both words and demeanour; but he stood squarely in front
of the great double door, so that the other could not enter.  The first
words which I heard from the visitor sufficiently explained the
situation:

"That's all very well, but I tell you I must see Mr. Trelawny!  What is
the use of your saying I can't, when I tell you I must.  You put me
off, and off, and off!  I came here at nine; you said then that he was
not up, and that as he was not well he could not be disturbed.  I came
at twelve; and you told me again he was not up.  I asked then to see
any of his household; you told me that Miss Trelawny was not up.  Now I
come again at three, and you tell me he is still in bed, and is not
awake yet.  Where is Miss Trelawny?  'She is occupied and must not be
disturbed!'  Well, she must be disturbed!  Or some one must.  I am here
about Mr. Trelawny's special business; and I have come from a place
where servants always begin by saying No.  'No' isn't good enough for
me this time!  I've had three years of it, waiting outside doors and
tents when it took longer to get in than it did into the tombs; and
then you would think, too, the men inside were as dead as the mummies.
I've had about enough of it, I tell you.  And when I come home, and
find the door of the man I've been working for barred, in just the same
way and with the same old answers, it stirs me up the wrong way.  Did
Mr. Trelawny leave orders that he would not see me when I should come?"

He paused and excitedly mopped his forehead.  The servant answered very
respectfully:

"I am very sorry, sir, if in doing my duty I have given any offence.
But I have my orders, and must obey them.  If you would like to leave
any message, I will give it to Miss Trelawny; and if you will leave
your address, she can communicate with you if she wishes."  The answer
came in such a way that it was easy to see that the speaker was a
kind-hearted man, and a just one.

"My good fellow, I have no fault to find with you personally; and I am
sorry if I have hurt your feelings.  I must be just, even if I am
angry. But it is enough to anger any man to find himself in the
position I am. Time is pressing.  There is not an hour--not a
minute--to lose!  And yet here I am, kicking my heels for six hours;
knowing all the time that your master will be a hundred times angrier
than I am, when he hears how the time has been fooled away.  He would
rather be waked out of a thousand sleeps than not see me just at
present--and before it is too late.  My God! it's simply dreadful,
after all I've gone through, to have my work spoiled at the last and be
foiled in the very doorway by a stupid flunkey!  Is there no one with
sense in the house; or with authority, even if he hasn't got sense?  I
could mighty soon convince him that your master must be awakened; even
if he sleeps like the Seven Sleepers--"

There was no mistaking the man's sincerity, or the urgency and
importance of his business; from his point of view at any rate.  I
stepped forward.

"Morris," I said, "you had better tell Miss Trelawny that this
gentleman wants to see her particularly.  If she is busy, ask Mrs.
Grant to tell her."

"Very good, sir!" he answered in a tone of relief, and hurried away.

I took the stranger into the little boudoir across the hall.  As we
went he asked me:

"Are you the secretary?"

"No!  I am a friend of Miss Trelawny's.  My name is Ross."

"Thank you very much, Mr. Ross, for your kindness!" he said.  "My name
is Corbeck.  I would give you my card, but they don't use cards where
I've come from.  And if I had had any, I suppose they, too, would have
gone last night--"

He stopped suddenly, as though conscious that he had said too much.  We
both remained silent; as we waited I took stock of him.  A short,
sturdy man, brown as a coffee-berry; possibly inclined to be fat, but
now lean exceedingly.  The deep wrinkles in his face and neck were not
merely from time and exposure; there were those unmistakable signs
where flesh or fat has fallen away, and the skin has become loose.  The
neck was simply an intricate surface of seams and wrinkles, and
sun-scarred with the burning of the Desert.  The Far East, the Tropic
Seasons, and the Desert--each can have its colour mark.  But all three
are quite different; and an eye which has once known, can thenceforth
easily distinguish them.  The dusky pallor of one; the fierce red-brown
of the other; and of the third, the dark, ingrained burning, as though
it had become a permanent colour.  Mr. Corbeck had a big head, massive
and full; with shaggy, dark red-brown hair, but bald on the temples.
His forehead was a fine one, high and broad; with, to use the terms of
physiognomy, the frontal sinus boldly marked.  The squareness of it
showed "ratiocination"; and the fulness under the eyes "language".  He
had the short, broad nose that marks energy; the square chin--marked
despite a thick, unkempt beard--and massive jaw that showed great
resolution.

"No bad man for the Desert!" I thought as I looked.

Miss Trelawny came very quickly.  When Mr. Corbeck saw her, he seemed
somewhat surprised.  But his annoyance and excitement had not
disappeared; quite enough remained to cover up any such secondary and
purely exoteric feeling as surprise. But as she spoke he never took his
eyes off her; and I made a mental note that I would find some early
opportunity of investigating the cause of his surprise.  She began with
an apology which quite smoothed down his ruffled feelings:

"Of course, had my Father been well you would not have been kept
waiting.  Indeed, had not I been on duty in the sick-room when you
called the first time, I should have seen you at once.  Now will you
kindly tell me what is the matter which so presses?" He looked at me
and hesitated.  She spoke at once:

"You may say before Mr. Ross anything which you can tell me.  He has my
fullest confidence, and is helping me in my trouble.  I do not think
you quite understand how serious my Father's condition is.  For three
days he has not waked, or given any sign of consciousness; and I am in
terrible trouble about him.  Unhappily I am in great ignorance of my
Father and his life.  I only came to live with him a year ago; and I
know nothing whatever of his affairs.  I do not even know who you are,
or in what way your business is associated with him."  She said this
with a little deprecating smile, all conventional and altogether
graceful; as though to express in the most genuine way her absurd
ignorance.

He looked steadily at her for perhaps a quarter of a minute; then he
spoke, beginning at once as though his mind were made up and his
confidence established:

"My name is Eugene Corbeck.  I am a Master of Arts and Doctor of Laws
and Master of Surgery of Cambridge; Doctor of Letters of Oxford; Doctor
of Science and Doctor of Languages of London University; Doctor of
Philosophy of Berlin; Doctor of Oriental Languages of Paris.  I have
some other degrees, honorary and otherwise, but I need not trouble you
with them.  Those I have name will show you that I am sufficiently
feathered with diplomas to fly into even a sick-room.  Early in
life--fortunately for my interests and pleasures, but unfortunately for
my pocket--I fell in with Egyptology.  I must have been bitten by some
powerful scarab, for I took it bad.  I went out tomb-hunting; and
managed to get a living of a sort, and to learn some things that you
can't get out of books.  I was in pretty low water when I met your
Father, who was doing some explorations on his own account; and since
then I haven't found that I have many unsatisfied wants.  He is a real
patron of the arts; no mad Egyptologist can ever hope for a better
chief!"

He spoke with feeling; and I was glad to see that Miss Trelawny
coloured up with pleasure at the praise of her father.  I could not
help noticing, however, that Mr. Corbeck was, in a measure, speaking as
if against time.  I took it that he wished, while speaking, to study
his ground; to see how far he would be justified in taking into
confidence the two strangers before him.  As he went on, I could see
that his confidence kept increasing.  When I thought of it afterward,
and remembered what he had said, I realised that the measure of the
information which he gave us marked his growing trust.

"I have been several times out on expeditions in Egypt for your Father;
and I have always found it a delight to work for him.  Many of his
treasures--and he has some rare ones, I tell you-he has procured
through me, either by my exploration or by purchase--or--or--otherwise.
Your Father, Miss Trelawny, has a rare knowledge.  He sometimes makes
up his mind that he wants to find a particular thing, of whose
existence--if it still exists--he has become aware; and he will follow
it all over the world till he gets it.  I've been on just such a chase
now."

He stopped suddenly, as suddenly as thought his mouth had been shut by
the jerk of a string.  We waited; when he went on he spoke with a
caution that was new to him, as though he wished to forestall our
asking any questions:

"I am not at liberty to mention anything of my mission; where it was
to, what it was for, or anything at all about it.  Such matters are in
confidence between Mr. Trelawny and myself; I am pledged to absolute
secrecy."

He paused, and an embarrassed look crept over his face.  Suddenly he
said:

"You are sure, Miss Trelawny, your Father is not well enough to see me
today?"

A look of wonderment was on her face in turn.  But it cleared at
once;--she stood up, saying in a tone in which dignity and graciousness
were blended:

"Come and see for yourself!"  She moved toward her father's room; he
followed, and I brought up the rear.

Mr. Corbeck entered the sick-room as though he knew it.  There is an
unconscious attitude or bearing to persons in new surroundings which
there is no mistaking. Even in his anxiety to see his powerful friend,
he glanced for a moment round the room, as at a familiar place.  Then
all his attention became fixed on the bed.  I watched him narrowly, for
somehow I felt that on this man depended much of our enlightenment
regarding the strange matter in which we were involved.

It was not that I doubted him.  The man was of transparent honesty; it
was this very quality which we had to dread.  He was of that
courageous, fixed trueness to his undertaking, that if he should deem
it his duty to guard a secret he would do it to the last.  The case
before us was, at least, an unusual one; and it would, consequently,
require more liberal recognition of bounds of the duty of secrecy than
would hold under ordinary conditions.  To us, ignorance was
helplessness.  If we could learn anything of the past we might at least
form some idea of the conditions antecedent to the attack; and might,
so, achieve some means of helping the patient to recovery. There were
curios which might be removed.... My thoughts were beginning to whirl
once again; I pulled myself up sharply and watched.  There was a look
of infinite pity on the sun-stained, rugged face as he gazed at his
friend, lying so helpless. The sternness of Mr. Trelawny's face had not
relaxed in sleep; but somehow it made the helplessness more marked.  It
would not have troubled one to see a weak or an ordinary face under
such conditions; but this purposeful, masterful man, lying before us
wrapped in impenetrable sleep, had all the pathos of a great ruin.  The
sight was not a new one to us; but I could see that Miss Trelawny, like
myself, was moved afresh by it in the presence of the stranger.  Mr.
Corbeck's face grew stern.  All the pity died away; and in its stead
came a grim, hard look which boded ill for whoever had been the cause
of this mighty downfall.  This look in turn gave place to one of
decision; the volcanic energy of the man was working to some definite
purpose.  He glanced around at us; and as his eyes lighted on Nurse
Kennedy his eyebrows went up a trifle.  She noted the look, and glanced
interrogatively at Miss Trelawny, who flashed back a reply with a
glance.  She went quietly from the room, closing the door behind her.
Mr. Corbeck looked first at me, with a strong man's natural impulse to
learn from a man rather than a woman; then at Miss Trelawny, with a
remembrance of the duty of courtesy, and said:

"Tell me all about it.  How it began and when!"  Miss Trelawny looked
at me appeallingly; and forthwith I told him all that I knew.  He
seemed to make no motion during the whole time; but insensibly the
bronze face became steel.  When, at the end, I told him of Mr. Marvin's
visit and of the Power of Attorney, his look began to brighten.  And
when, seeing his interest in the matter, I went more into detail as to
its terms, he spoke:

"Good!  Now I know where my duty lies!"

With a sinking heart I heard him.  Such a phrase, coming at such a
time, seemed to close the door to my hopes of enlightenment.

"What do you mean?" I asked, feeling that my question was a feeble one.

His answer emphasized my fears:

"Trelawny knows what he is doing.  He had some definite purpose in all
that he did; and we must not thwart him.  He evidently expected
something to happen, and guarded himself at all points."

"Not at all points!" I said impulsively.  "There must have been a weak
spot somewhere, or he wouldn't be lying here like that!"  Somehow his
impassiveness surprised me.  I had expected that he would find a valid
argument in my phrase; but it did not move him, at least not in the way
I thought.  Something like a smile flickered over his swarthy face as
he answered me:

"This is not the end!  Trelawny did not guard himself to no purpose.
Doubtless, he expected this too; or at any rate the possibility of it."

"Do you know what he expected, or from what source?"  The questioner
was Miss Trelawny.

The answer came at once:  "No!  I know nothing of either. I can
guess..."  He stopped suddenly.

"Guess what?"  The suppressed excitement in the girl's voice was akin
to anguish. The steely look came over the swarthy face again; but there
was tenderness and courtesy in both voice and manner as he replied:

"Believe me, I would do anything I honestly could to relieve you
anxiety.  But in this I have a higher duty."

"What duty?"

"Silence!"  As he spoke the word, the strong mouth closed like a steel
trap.

We all remained silent for a few minutes.  In the intensity of our
thinking, the silence became a positive thing; the small sounds of life
within and without the house seemed intrusive.  The first to break it
was Miss Trelawny.  I had seen an idea--a hope--flash in her eyes; but
she steadied herself before speaking:

"What was the urgent subject on which you wanted to see me, knowing
that my Father was--not available?"  The pause showed her mastery of
her thoughts.

The instantaneous change in Mr. Corbeck was almost ludicrous.  His
start of surprise, coming close upon his iron-clad impassiveness, was
like a pantomimic change.  But all idea of comedy was swept away by the
tragic earnestness with which he remembered his original purpose.

"My God!" he said, as he raised his hand from the chair back on which
it rested, and beat it down with a violence which would in itself have
arrested attention.  His brows corrugated as he went on:  "I quite
forgot!  What a loss!  Now of all times!  Just at the moment of
success! He lying there helpless, and my tongue tied!  Not able to
raise hand or foot in my ignorance of his wishes!"

"What is it?  Oh, do tell us!  I am so anxious about my dear Father!
Is it any new trouble?  I hope not! oh, I hope not!  I have had such
anxiety and trouble already!  It alarms me afresh to hear you speak so!
Won't you tell me something to allay this terrible anxiety and
uncertainty?"

He drew his sturdy form up to his full height as he said:

"Alas!  I cannot, may not, tell you anything.  It is his secret."  He
pointed to the bed. "And yet--and yet I came here for his advice, his
counsel, his assistance.  And he lies there helpless.... And time is
flying by us!  It may soon be too late!"

"What is it? what is it?" broke in Miss Trelawny in a sort of passion
of anxiety, her face drawn with pain.  "Oh, speak!  Say something!
This anxiety, and horror, and mystery are killing me!"  Mr. Corbeck
calmed himself by a great effort.

"I may not tell you details; but I have had a great loss.  My mission,
in which I have spent three years, was successful.  I discovered all
that I sought--and more; and brought them home with me safely.
Treasures, priceless in themselves, but doubly precious to him by whose
wishes and instructions I sought them.  I arrived in London only last
night, and when I woke this morning my precious charge was stolen.
Stolen in some mysterious way.  Not a soul in London knew that I was
arriving.  No one but myself knew what was in the shabby portmanteau
that I carried.  My room had but one door, and that I locked and
bolted. The room was high in the house, five stories up, so that no
entrance could have been obtained by the window.  Indeed, I had closed
the window myself and shut the hasp, for I wished to be secure in every
way.  This morning the hasp was untouched.... And yet my portmanteau
was empty. The lamps were gone! ... There! it is out.  I went to Egypt
to search for a set of antique lamps which Mr. Trelawny wished to
trace.  With incredible labour, and through many dangers, I followed
them.  I brought them safe home.... And now!"  He turned away much
moved.  Even his iron nature was breaking down under the sense of loss.

Miss Trelawny stepped over and laid her hand on his arm.  I looked at
her in amazement.  All the passion and pain which had so moved her
seemed to have taken the form of resolution.  Her form was erect, her
eyes blazed; energy was manifest in every nerve and fibre of her being.
Even her voice was full of nervous power as she spoke.  It was apparent
that she was a marvellously strong woman, and that her strength could
answer when called upon.

"We must act at once!  My Father's wishes must be carried out if it is
possible to us. Mr. Ross, you are a lawyer.  We have actually in the
house a man whom you consider one of the best detectives in London.
Surely we can do something.  We can begin at once!"  Mr. Corbeck took
new life from her enthusiasm.

"Good!  You are your Father's daughter!" was all he said.  But his
admiration for her energy was manifested by the impulsive way in which
he took her hand.  I moved over to the door.  I was going to bring
Sergeant Daw; and from her look of approval, I knew that Margaret--Miss
Trelawny--understood.  I was at the door when Mr. Corbeck called me
back.

"One moment," he said, "before we bring a stranger on the scene.  It
must be borne in mind that he is not to know what you know now, that
the lamps were the objects of a prolonged and difficult and dangerous
search.  All I can tell him, all that he must know from any source, is
that some of my property has been stolen.  I must describe some of the
lamps, especially one, for it is of gold; and my fear is lest the
thief, ignorant of its historic worth, may, in order to cover up his
crime, have it melted.  I would willingly pay ten, twenty, a hundred, a
thousand times its intrinsic value rather than have it destroyed.  I
shall tell him only what is necessary.  So, please, let me answer any
questions he may ask; unless, of course, I ask you or refer to either
of you for the answer."  We both nodded acquiescence.  Then a thought
struck me and I said:

"By the way, if it be necessary to keep this matter quiet it will be
better to have it if possible a private job for the Detective.  If once
a thing gets to Scotland Yard it is out of our power to keep it quiet,
and further secrecy may be impossible.  I shall sound Sergeant Daw
before he comes up.  If I say nothing, it will mean that he accepts the
task and will deal with it privately."  Mr. Corbeck answered at once:

"Secrecy is everything.  The one thing I dread is that the lamps, or
some of them, may be destroyed at once."  To my intense astonishment
Miss Trelawny spoke out at once, but quietly, in a decided voice:

"They will not be destroyed; nor any of them!"  Mr. Corbeck actually
smiled in amazement.

"How on earth do you know?" he asked.  Her answer was still more
incomprehensible:

"I don't know how I know it; but know it I do.  I feel it all through
me; as though it were a conviction which has been with me all my life!"




Chapter VIII

The Finding of the Lamps


Sergeant Daw at first made some demur; but finally agreed to advise
privately on a matter which might be suggested to him.  He added that I
was to remember that he only undertook to advise; for if action were
required he might have to refer the matter to headquarters.  With this
understanding I left him in the study, and brought Miss Trelawny and
Mr. Corbeck to him.  Nurse Kennedy resumed her place at the bedside
before we left the room.

I could not but admire the cautious, cool-headed precision with which
the traveller stated his case.  He did not seem to conceal anything,
and yet he gave the least possible description of the objects missing.
He did not enlarge on the mystery of the case; he seemed to look on it
as an ordinary hotel theft.  Knowing, as I did, that his one object was
to recover the articles before their identity could be obliterated, I
could see the rare intellectual skill with which he gave the necessary
matter and held back all else, though without seeming to do so.
"Truly," thought I, "this man has learned the lesson of the Eastern
bazaars; and with Western intellect has improved upon his masters!"  He
quite conveyed his idea to the Detective, who, after thinking the
matter over for a few moments, said:

"Pot or scale? that is the question."

"What does that mean?" asked the other, keenly alert.

"An old thieves phrase from Birmingham.  I thought that in these days
of slang everyone knew that.  In old times at Brum, which had a lot of
small metal industries, the gold- and silver-smiths used to buy metal
from almost anyone who came along. And as metal in small quantities
could generally be had cheap when they didn't ask where it came from,
it got to be a custom to ask only one thing--whether the customer
wanted the goods melted, in which case the buyer made the price, and
the melting-pot was always on the fire.  If it was to be preserved in
its present state at the buyer's option, it went into the scale and
fetched standard price for old metal.

"There is a good deal of such work done still, and in other places than
Brum.  When we're looking for stolen watches we often come across the
works, and it's not possible to identify wheels and springs out of a
heap; but it's not often that we come across cases that are wanted.
Now, in the present instance much will depend on whether the thief is a
good man--that's what they call a man who knows his work.  A
first-class crook will know whether a thing is of more value than
merely the metal in it; and in such case he would put it with someone
who could place it later on--in America or France, perhaps.  By the
way, do you think anyone but yourself could identify your lamps?"

"No one but myself!"

"Are there others like them?"

"Not that I know of," answered Mr. Corbeck; "though there may be others
that resemble them in many particulars."  The Detective paused before
asking again: "Would any other skilled person--at the British Museum,
for instance, or a dealer, or a collector like Mr. Trelawny, know the
value--the artistic value--of the lamps?"

"Certainly!  Anyone with a head on his shoulders would see at a glance
that the things were valuable."

The Detective's face brightened.  "Then there is a chance.  If your
door was locked and the window shut, the goods were not stolen by the
chance of a chambermaid or a boots coming along.  Whoever did the job
went after it special; and he ain't going to part with his swag without
his price.  This must be a case of notice to the pawnbrokers.  There's
one good thing about it, anyhow, that the hue and cry needn't be given.
We needn't tell Scotland Yard unless you like; we can work the thing
privately.  If you wish to keep the thing dark, as you told me at the
first, that is our chance."  Mr. Corbeck, after a pause, said quietly:

"I suppose you couldn't hazard a suggestion as to how the robbery was
effected?" The Policeman smiled the smile of knowledge and experience.

"In a very simple way, I have no doubt, sir.  That is how all these
mysterious crimes turn out in the long-run.  The criminal knows his
work and all the tricks of it; and he is always on the watch for
chances. Moreover, he knows by experience what these chances are likely
to be, and how they usually come.  The other person is only careful; he
doesn't know all the tricks and pits that may be made for him, and by
some little oversight or other he falls into the trap.  When we know
all about this case, you will wonder that you did not see the method of
it all along!"  This seemed to annoy Mr. Corbeck a little; there was
decided heat in his manner as he answered:

"Look here, my good friend, there is not anything simple about this
case--except that the things were taken.  The window was closed; the
fireplace was bricked up.  There is only one door to the room, and that
I locked and bolted.  There is no transom; I have heard all about hotel
robberies through the transom.  I never left my room in the night.  I
looked at the things before going to bed; and I went to look at them
again when I woke up.  If you can rig up any kind of simple robbery out
of these facts you are a clever man.  That's all I say; clever enough
to go right away and get my things back."  Miss Trelawny laid her hand
upon his arm in a soothing way, and said quietly:

"Do not distress yourself unnecessarily.  I am sure they will turn up."
Sergeant Daw turned to her so quickly that I could not help remembering
vividly his suspicions of her, already formed, as he said:

"May I ask, miss, on what you base that opinion?"

I dreaded to hear her answer, given to ears already awake to suspicion;
but it came to me as a new pain or shock all the same:

"I cannot tell you how I know.  But I am sure of it!"  The Detective
looked at her for some seconds in silence, and then threw a quick
glance at me.

Presently he had a little more conversation with Mr. Corbeck as to his
own movements, the details of the hotel and the room, and the means of
identifying the goods.  Then he went away to commence his inquiries,
Mr. Corbeck impressing on him the necessity for secrecy lest the thief
should get wind of his danger and destroy the lamps.  Mr. Corbeck
promised, when going away to attend to various matters of his own
business, to return early in the evening, and to stay in the house.

All that day Miss Trelawny was in better spirits and looked in better
strength than she had yet been, despite the new shock and annoyance of
the theft which must ultimately bring so much disappointment to her
father.

We spent most of the day looking over the curio treasures of Mr.
Trelawny.  From what I had heard from Mr. Corbeck I began to have some
idea of the vastness of his enterprise in the world of Egyptian
research; and with this light everything around me began to have a new
interest.  As I went on, the interest grew; any lingering doubts which
I might have had changed to wonder and admiration.  The house seemed to
be a veritable storehouse of marvels of antique art.  In addition to
the curios, big and little, in Mr. Trelawny's own room--from the great
sarcophagi down to the scarabs of all kinds in the cabinets--the great
hall, the staircase landings, the study, and even the boudoir were full
of antique pieces which would have made a collector's mouth water.

Miss Trelawny from the first came with me, and looked with growing
interest at everything.  After having examined some cabinets of
exquisite amulets she said to me in quite a naive way:

"You will hardly believe that I have of late seldom even looked at any
of these things. It is only since Father has been ill that I seem to
have even any curiosity about them. But now, they grow and grow on me
to quite an absorbing degree.  I wonder if it is that the collector's
blood which I have in my veins is beginning to manifest itself.  If so,
the strange thing is that I have not felt the call of it before.  Of
course I know most of the big things, and have examined them more or
less; but really, in a sort of way I have always taken them for
granted, as though they had always been there.  I have noticed the same
thing now and again with family pictures, and the way they are taken
for granted by the family.  If you will let me examine them with you it
will be delightful!"

It was a joy to me to hear her talk in such a way; and her last
suggestion quite thrilled me.  Together we went round the various rooms
and passages, examining and admiring the magnificent curios.  There was
such a bewildering amount and variety of objects that we could only
glance at most of them; but as we went along we arranged that we should
take them seriatim, day by day, and examine them more closely.  In the
hall was a sort of big frame of floriated steel work which Margaret
said her father used for lifting the heavy stone lids of the
sarcophagi.  It was not heavy and could be moved about easily enough.
By aid of this we raised the covers in turn and looked at the endless
series of hieroglyphic pictures cut in most of them.  In spite of her
profession of ignorance Margaret knew a good deal about them; her year
of life with her father had had unconsciously its daily and hourly
lesson.  She was a remarkably clever and acute-minded girl, and with a
prodigious memory; so that her store of knowledge, gathered
unthinkingly bit by bit, had grown to proportions that many a scholar
might have envied.

And yet it was all so naive and unconscious; so girlish and simple.
She was so fresh in her views and ideas, and had so little thought of
self, that in her companionship I forgot for the time all the troubles
and mysteries which enmeshed the house; and I felt like a boy again....

The most interesting of the sarcophagi were undoubtedly the three in
Mr. Trelawny's room.  Of these, two were of dark stone, one of porphyry
and the other of a sort of ironstone.  These were wrought with some
hieroglyphs.  But the third was strikingly different.  It was of some
yellow-brown substance of the dominating colour effect of Mexican onyx,
which it resembled in many ways, excepting that the natural pattern of
its convolutions was less marked.  Here and there were patches almost
transparent--certainly translucent.  The whole chest, cover and all,
was wrought with hundreds, perhaps thousands, of minute hieroglyphics,
seemingly in an endless series.  Back, front, sides, edges, bottom, all
had their quota of the dainty pictures, the deep blue of their
colouring showing up fresh and sharply edge in the yellow stone.  It
was very long, nearly nine feet; and perhaps a yard wide.  The sides
undulated, so that there was no hard line.  Even the corners took such
excellent curves that they pleased the eye.  "Truly," I said, "this
must have been made for a giant!"

"Or for a giantess!" said Margaret.

This sarcophagus stood near to one of the windows.  It was in one
respect different from all the other sarcophagi in the place.  All the
others in the house, of whatever material--granite, porphyry,
ironstone, basalt, slate, or wood--were quite simple in form within.
Some of them were plain of interior surface; others were engraved, in
whole or part, with hieroglyphics.  But each and all of them had no
protuberances or uneven surface anywhere.  They might have been used
for baths; indeed, they resembled in many ways Roman baths of stone or
marble which I had seen.  Inside this, however, was a raised space,
outlined like a human figure.  I asked Margaret if she could explain it
in any way.  For answer she said:

"Father never wished to speak about this.  It attracted my attention
from the first; but when I asked him about it he said:  'I shall tell
you all about it some day, little girl--if I live!  But not yet!  The
story is not yet told, as I hope to tell it to you!  Some day, perhaps
soon, I shall know all; and then we shall go over it together.  And a
mighty interesting story you will find it--from first to last!'  Once
afterward I said, rather lightly I am afraid:  'Is that story of the
sarcophagus told yet, Father?'  He shook his head, and looked at me
gravely as he said:  'Not yet, little girl; but it will be--if I
live--if I live!'  His repeating that phrase about his living rather
frightened me; I never ventured to ask him again."

Somehow this thrilled me.  I could not exactly say how or why; but it
seemed like a gleam of light at last.  There are, I think, moments when
the mind accepts something as true; though it can account for neither
the course of the thought, nor, if there be more than one thought, the
connection between them.  Hitherto we had been in such outer darkness
regarding Mr. Trelawny, and the strange visitation which had fallen on
him, that anything which afforded a clue, even of the faintest and most
shadowy kind, had at the outset the enlightening satisfaction of a
certainty.  Here were two lights of our puzzle.  The first that Mr.
Trelawny associated with this particular curio a doubt of his own
living.  The second that he had some purpose or expectation with regard
to it, which he would not disclose, even to his daughter, till
complete. Again it was to be borne in mind that this sarcophagus
differed internally from all the others.  What meant that odd raised
place?  I said nothing to Miss Trelawny, for I feared lest I should
either frighten her or buoy her up with future hopes; but I made up my
mind that I would take an early opportunity for further investigation.

Close beside the sarcophagus was a low table of green stone with red
veins in it, like bloodstone.  The feet were fashioned like the paws of
a jackal, and round each leg was twined a full-throated snake wrought
exquisitely in pure gold.  On it rested a strange and very beautiful
coffer or casket of stone of a peculiar shape.  It was something like a
small coffin, except that the longer sides, instead of being cut off
square like the upper or level part were continued to a point.  Thus it
was an irregular septahedron, there being two planes on each of the two
sides, one end and a top and bottom.  The stone, of one piece of which
it was wrought, was such as I had never seen before.  At the base it
was of a full green, the colour of emerald without, of course, its
gleam. It was not by any means dull, however, either in colour or
substance, and was of infinite hardness and fineness of texture.  The
surface was almost that of a jewel.  The colour grew lighter as it
rose, with gradation so fine as to be imperceptible, changing to a fine
yellow almost of the colour of "mandarin" china.  It was quite unlike
anything I had ever seen, and did not resemble any stone or gem that I
knew.  I took it to be some unique mother-stone, or matrix of some gem.
It was wrought all over, except in a few spots, with fine
hieroglyphics, exquisitely done and coloured with the same blue-green
cement or pigment that appeared on the sarcophagus.  In length it was
about two feet and a half; in breadth about half this, and was nearly a
foot high.  The vacant spaces were irregularly distributed about the
top running to the pointed end.  These places seemed less opaque than
the rest of the stone.  I tried to lift up the lid so that I might see
if they were translucent; but it was securely fixed.  It fitted so
exactly that the whole coffer seemed like a single piece of stone
mysteriously hollowed from within.  On the sides and edges were some
odd-looking protuberances wrought just as finely as any other portion
of the coffer which had been sculptured by manifest design in the
cutting of the stone.  They had queer-shaped holes or hollows,
different in each; and, like the rest, were covered with the
hieroglyphic figures, cut finely and filled in with the same blue-green
cement.

On the other side of the great sarcophagus stood another small table of
alabaster, exquisitely chased with symbolic figures of gods and the
signs of the zodiac.  On this table stood a case of about a foot square
composed of slabs of rock crystal set in a skeleton of bands of red
gold, beautifully engraved with hieroglyphics, and coloured with a blue
green, very much the tint of the figures on the sarcophagus and the
coffer.  The whole work was quite modern.

But if the case was modern what it held was not.  Within, on a cushion
of cloth of gold as fine as silk, and with the peculiar softness of old
gold, rested a mummy hand, so perfect that it startled one to see it.
A woman's hand, fine and long, with slim tapering fingers and nearly as
perfect as when it was given to the embalmer thousands of years before.
In the embalming it had lost nothing of its beautiful shape; even the
wrist seemed to maintain its pliability as the gentle curve lay on the
cushion.  The skin was of a rich creamy or old ivory colour; a dusky
fair skin which suggested heat, but heat in shadow.  The great
peculiarity of it, as a hand, was that it had in all seven fingers,
there being two middle and two index fingers.  The upper end of the
wrist was jagged, as though it had been broken off, and was stained
with a red-brown stain.  On the cushion near the hand was a small
scarab, exquisitely wrought of emerald.

"That is another of Father's mysteries.  When I asked him about it he
said that it was perhaps the most valuable thing he had, except one.
When I asked him what that one was, he refused to tell me, and forbade
me to ask him anything concerning it. 'I will tell you,' he said, 'all
about it, too, in good time--if I live!'"

"If I live!" the phrase again.  These three things grouped together,
the Sarcophagus, the Coffer, and the Hand, seemed to make a trilogy of
mystery indeed!

At this time Miss Trelawny was sent for on some domestic matter.  I
looked at the other curios in the room; but they did not seem to have
anything like the same charm for me, now that she was away.  Later on
in the day I was sent for to the boudoir where she was consulting with
Mrs. Grant as to the lodgment of Mr. Corbeck.  They were in doubt as to
whether he should have a room close to Mr. Trelawny's or quite away
from it, and had thought it well to ask my advice on the subject.  I
came to the conclusion that he had better not be too near; for the
first at all events, he could easily be moved closer if necessary.
When Mrs. Grant had gone, I asked Miss Trelawny how it came that the
furniture of this room, the boudoir in which we were, was so different
from the other rooms of the house.

"Father's forethought!" she answered.  "When I first came, he thought,
and rightly enough, that I might get frightened with so many records of
death and the tomb everywhere.  So he had this room and the little
suite off it--that door opens into the sitting-room--where I slept last
night, furnished with pretty things.  You see, they are all beautiful.
That cabinet belonged to the great Napoleon."

"There is nothing Egyptian in these rooms at all then?" I asked, rather
to show interest in what she had said than anything else, for the
furnishing of the room was apparent.  "What a lovely cabinet!  May I
look at it?"

"Of course! with the greatest pleasure!" she answered, with a smile.
"Its finishing, within and without, Father says, is absolutely
complete."  I stepped over and looked at it closely.  It was made of
tulip wood, inlaid in patterns; and was mounted in ormolu.  I pulled
open one of the drawers, a deep one where I could see the work to great
advantage.  As I pulled it, something rattled inside as though rolling;
there was a tinkle as of metal on metal.

"Hullo!" I said.  "There is something in here.  Perhaps I had better
not open it."

"There is nothing that I know of," she answered.  "Some of the
housemaids may have used it to put something by for the time and
forgotten it.  Open it by all means!"

I pulled open the drawer; as I did so, both Miss Trelawny and I started
back in amazement.

There before our eyes lay a number of ancient Egyptian lamps, of
various sizes and of strangely varied shapes.

We leaned over them and looked closely.  My own heart was beating like
a trip-hammer; and I could see by the heaving of Margaret's bosom that
she was strangely excited.

Whilst we looked, afraid to touch and almost afraid to think, there was
a ring at the front door; immediately afterwards Mr. Corbeck, followed
by Sergeant Daw, came into the hall.  The door of the boudoir was open,
and when they saw us Mr. Corbeck came running in, followed more slowly
by the Detective.  There was a sort of chastened joy in his face and
manner as he said impulsively:

"Rejoice with me, my dear Miss Trelawny, my luggage has come and all my
things are intact!"  Then his face fell as he added, "Except the lamps.
The lamps that were worth all the rest a thousand times...."  He
stopped, struck by the strange pallor of her face.  Then his eyes,
following her look and mine, lit on the cluster of lamps in the drawer.
He gave a sort of cry of surprise and joy as he bent over and touched
them:

"My lamps!  My lamps!  Then they are safe--safe--safe! ... But how, in
the name of God--of all the Gods--did they come here?"

We all stood silent.  The Detective made a deep sound of in-taking
breath.  I looked at him, and as he caught my glance he turned his eyes
on Miss Trelawny whose back was toward him.

There was in them the same look of suspicion which had been there when
he had spoken to me of her being the first to find her father on the
occasions of the attacks.




Chapter IX

The Need of Knowledge


Mr. Corbeck seemed to go almost off his head at the recovery of the
lamps.  He took them up one by one and looked them all over tenderly,
as though they were things that he loved.  In his delight and
excitement he breathed so hard that it seemed almost like a cat
purring.  Sergeant Daw said quietly, his voice breaking the silence
like a discord in a melody:

"Are you quite sure those lamps are the ones you had, and that were
stolen?"

His answer was in an indignant tone:  "Sure!  Of course I'm sure.
There isn't another set of lamps like these in the world!"

"So far as you know!"  The Detective's words were smooth enough, but
his manner was so exasperating that I was sure he had some motive in
it; so I waited in silence. He went on:

"Of course there may be some in the British Museum; or Mr. Trelawny may
have had these already.  There's nothing new under the sun, you know,
Mr. Corbeck; not even in Egypt.  These may be the originals, and yours
may have been the copies.  Are there any points by which you can
identify these as yours?"

Mr. Corbeck was really angry by this time.  He forgot his reserve; and
in his indignation poured forth a torrent of almost incoherent, but
enlightening, broken sentences:

"Identify!  Copies of them!  British Museum!  Rot!  Perhaps they keep a
set in Scotland Yard for teaching idiot policemen Egyptology!  Do I
know them?  When I have carried them about my body, in the desert, for
three months; and lay awake night after night to watch them!  When I
have looked them over with a magnifying-glass, hour after hour, till my
eyes ached; till every tiny blotch, and chip, and dinge became as
familiar to me as his chart to a captain; as familiar as they doubtless
have been all the time to every thick-headed area-prowler within the
bounds of mortality.  See here, young man, look at these!"  He ranged
the lamps in a row on the top of the cabinet.  "Did you ever see a set
of lamps of these shapes--of any one of these shapes?  Look at these
dominant figures on them!  Did you ever see so complete a set--even in
Scotland Yard; even in Bow Street?  Look! one on each, the seven forms
of Hathor. Look at that figure of the Ka of a Princess of the Two
Egypts, standing between Ra and Osiris in the Boat of the Dead, with
the Eye of Sleep, supported on legs, bending before her; and Harmochis
rising in the north.  Will you find that in the British Museum--or Bow
Street?  Or perhaps your studies in the Gizeh Museum, or the
Fitzwilliam, or Paris, or Leyden, or Berlin, have shown you that the
episode is common in hieroglyphics; and that this is only a copy.
Perhaps you can tell me what that figure of Ptah-Seker-Ausar holding
the Tet wrapped in the Sceptre of Papyrus means?  Did you ever see it
before; even in the British Museum, or Gizeh, or Scotland Yard?"

He broke off suddenly; and then went on in quite a different way:

"Look here! it seems to me that the thick-headed idiot is myself!  I
beg your pardon, old fellow, for my rudeness.  I quite lost my temper
at the suggestion that I do not know these lamps.  You don't mind, do
you?" The Detective answered heartily:

"Lord, sir, not I.  I like to see folks angry when I am dealing with
them, whether they are on my side or the other.  It is when people are
angry that you learn the truth from them.  I keep cool; that is my
trade!  Do you know, you have told me more about those lamps in the
past two minutes than when you filled me up with details of how to
identify them."

Mr. Corbeck grunted; he was not pleased at having given himself away.
All at once he turned to  me and said in his natural way:

"Now tell me how you got them back?"  I was so surprised that I said
without thinking:

"We didn't get them back!"  The traveller laughed openly.

"What on earth do you mean?" he asked.  "You didn't get them back!
Why, there they are before your eyes!  We found you looking at them
when we came in."  By this time I had recovered my surprise and had my
wits about me.

"Why, that's just it," I said.  "We had only come across them, by
accident, that very moment!"

Mr. Corbeck drew back and looked hard at Miss Trelawny and myself;
turning his eyes from one to the other as he asked:

"Do you mean to tell me that no one brought them here; that you found
them in that drawer?  That, so to speak, no one at all brought them
back?"

"I suppose someone must have brought them here; they couldn't have come
of their own accord.  But who it was, or when, or how, neither of us
knows.  We shall have to make inquiry, and see if any of the servants
know anything of it."

We all stood silent for several seconds.  It seemed a long time.  The
first to speak was the Detective, who said in an unconscious way:

"Well, I'm damned!  I beg your pardon, miss!"  Then his mouth shut like
a steel trap.

We called up the servants, one by one, and asked them if they knew
anything of some articles placed in a drawer in the boudoir; but none
of them could throw any light on the circumstance.  We did not tell
them what the articles were; or let them see them.

Mr. Corbeck packed the lamps in cotton wool, and placed them in a tin
box.  This, I may mention incidentally, was then brought up to the
detectives' room, where one of the men stood guard over them with a
revolver the whole night.  Next day we got a small safe into the house,
and placed them in it.  There were two different keys.  One of them I
kept myself; the other I placed in my drawer in the Safe Deposit vault.
We were all determined that the lamps should not be lost again.

About an hour after we had found the lamps, Doctor Winchester arrived.
He had a large parcel with him, which, when unwrapped, proved to be the
mummy of a cat. With Miss Trelawny's permission he placed this in the
boudoir; and Silvio was brought close to it.  To the surprise of us
all, however, except perhaps Doctor Winchester, he did not manifest the
least annoyance; he took no notice of it whatever.  He stood on the
table close beside it, purring loudly.  Then, following out his plan,
the Doctor brought him into Mr. Trelawny's room, we all following.
Doctor Winchester was excited; Miss Trelawny anxious.  I was more than
interested myself, for I began to have a glimmering of the Doctor's
idea.  The Detective was calmly and coldly superior; but Mr. Corbeck,
who was an enthusiast, was full of eager curiosity.

The moment Doctor Winchester got into the room, Silvio began to mew and
wriggle; and jumping out of his arms, ran over to the cat mummy and
began to scratch angrily at it.  Miss Trelawny had some difficulty in
taking him away; but so soon as he was out of the room he became quiet.
When she came back there was a clamour of comments:

"I thought so!" from the Doctor.

"What can it mean?" from Miss Trelawny.

"That's a very strange thing!" from Mr. Corbeck.

"Odd! but it doesn't prove anything!" from the Detective.

"I suspend my judgment!" from myself, thinking it advisable to say
something.

Then by common consent we dropped the theme--for the present.

In my room that evening I was making some notes of what had happened,
when there came a low tap on the door.  In obedience to my summons
Sergeant Daw came in, carefully closing the door behind him.

"Well, Sergeant," said I, "sit down.  What is it?"

"I wanted to speak to you, sir, about those lamps."  I nodded and
waited:  he went on:  "You know that that room where they were found
opens directly into the room where Miss Trelawny slept last night?"

"Yes."

"During the night a window somewhere in that part of the house was
opened, and shut again.  I heard it, and took a look round; but I could
see no sign of anything."

"Yes, I know that!" I said; "I heard a window moved myself."

"Does nothing strike you as strange about it, sir?"

"Strange!" I said; "Strange! why it's all the most bewildering,
maddening thing I have ever encountered.  It is all so strange that one
seems to wonder, and simply waits for what will happen next.  But what
do you mean by strange?"

The Detective paused, as if choosing his words to begin; and then said
deliberately:

"You see, I am not one who believes in magic and such things.  I am for
facts all the time; and I always find in the long-run that there is a
reason and a cause for everything.  This new gentleman says these
things were stolen out of his room in the hotel.  The lamps, I take it
from some things he has said, really belong to Mr. Trelawny.  His
daughter, the lady of the house, having left the room she usually
occupies, sleeps that night on the ground floor.  A window is heard to
open and shut during the night.  When we, who have been during the day
trying to find a clue to the robbery, come to the house, we find the
stolen goods in a room close to where she slept, and opening out of it!"

He stopped.  I felt that same sense of pain and apprehension, which I
had experienced when he had spoken to me before, creeping, or rather
rushing, over me again.  I had to face the matter out, however.  My
relations with her, and the feeling toward her which I now knew full
well meant a very deep love and devotion, demanded so much.  I said as
calmly as I could, for I knew the keen eyes of the skilful investigator
were on me:

"And the inference?"

He answered with the cool audacity of conviction:

"The inference to me is that there was no robbery at all.  The goods
were taken by someone to this house, where they were received through a
window on the ground floor.  They were placed in the cabinet, ready to
be discovered when the proper time should come!"

Somehow I felt relieved; the assumption was too monstrous.  I did not
want, however, my relief to be apparent, so I answered as gravely as I
could:

"And who do you suppose brought them to the house?"

"I keep my mind open as to that.  Possibly Mr. Corbeck himself; the
matter might be too risky to trust to a third party."

"Then the natural extension of your inference is that Mr. Corbeck is a
liar and a fraud; and that he is in conspiracy with Miss Trelawny to
deceive someone or other about those lamps."

"Those are harsh words, Mr. Ross.  They're so plain-spoken that they
bring a man up standing, and make new doubts for him.  But I have to go
where my reason points.  It may be that there is another party than
Miss Trelawny in it.  Indeed, if it hadn't been for the other matter
that set me thinking and bred doubts of its own about her, I wouldn't
dream of mixing her up in this.  But I'm safe on Corbeck.  Whoever else
is in it, he is!  The things couldn't have been taken without his
connivance--if what he says is true.  If it isn't--well! he is a liar
anyhow.  I would think it a bad job to have him stay in the house with
so many valuables, only that it will give me and my mate a chance of
watching him.  We'll keep a pretty good look-out, too, I tell you.
He's up in my room now, guarding those lamps; but Johnny Wright is
there too.  I go on before he comes off; so there won't be much chance
of another house-breaking.  Of course, Mr. Ross, all this, too, is
between you and me."

"Quite so!  You may depend on my silence!" I said; and he went away to
keep a close eye on the Egyptologist.

It seemed as though all my painful experiences were to go in pairs, and
that the sequence of the previous day was to be repeated; for before
long I had another private visit from Doctor Winchester who had now
paid his nightly visit to his patient and was on his way home.  He took
the seat which I proffered and began at once:

"This is a strange affair altogether.  Miss Trelawny has just been
telling me about the stolen lamps, and of the finding of them in the
Napoleon cabinet.  It would seem to be another complication of the
mystery; and yet, do you know, it is a relief to me.  I have exhausted
all human and natural possibilities of the case, and am beginning to
fall back on superhuman and supernatural possibilities.  Here are such
strange things that, if I am not going mad, I think we must have a
solution before long.  I wonder if I might ask some questions and some
help from Mr. Corbeck, without making further complications and
embarrassing us.  He seems to know an amazing amount regarding Egypt
and all relating to it.  Perhaps he wouldn't mind translating a little
bit of hieroglyphic.  It is child's play to him.  What do you think?"

When I had thought the matter over a few seconds I spoke.  We wanted
all the help we could get.  For myself, I had perfect confidence in
both men; and any comparing notes, or mutual assistance, might bring
good results.  Such could hardly bring evil.

"By all means I should ask him.  He seems an extraordinarily learned
man in Egyptology; and he seems to me a good fellow as well as an
enthusiast.  By the way, it will be necessary to be a little guarded as
to whom you speak regarding any information which he may give you."

"Of course!" he answered.  "Indeed I should not dream of saying
anything to anybody, excepting yourself.  We have to remember that when
Mr. Trelawny recovers he may not like to think that we have been
chattering unduly over his affairs."

"Look here!" I said, "why not stay for a while:  and I shall ask him to
come and have a pipe with us.  We can then talk over things."

He acquiesced:  so I went to the room where Mr. Corbeck was, and
brought him back with me.  I thought the detectives were pleased at his
going. On the way to my room he said:

"I don't half like leaving those things there, with only those men to
guard them. They're a deal sight too precious to be left to the police!"

From which it would appear that suspicion was not confined to Sergeant
Daw.

Mr. Corbeck and Doctor Winchester, after a quick glance at each other,
became at once on most friendly terms.  The traveller professed his
willingness to be of any assistance which he could, provided, he added,
that it was anything about which he was free to speak.  This was not
very promising; but Doctor Winchester began at once:

"I want you, if you will, to translate some hieroglyphic for me."

"Certainly, with the greatest pleasure, so far as I can.  For I may
tell you that hieroglyphic writing is not quite mastered yet; though we
are getting at it!  We are getting at it!  What is the inscription?"

"There are two," he answered.  "One of them I shall bring here."

He went out, and returned in a minute with the mummy cat which he had
that evening introduced to Silvio.  The scholar took it; and, after a
short examination, said:

"There is nothing especial in this.  It is an appeal to Bast, the Lady
of Bubastis, to give her good bread and milk in the Elysian Fields.
There may be more inside; and if you will care to unroll it, I will do
my best.  I do not think, however, that there is anything special.
From the method of wrapping I should say it is from the Delta; and of a
late period, when such mummy work was common and cheap.  What is the
other inscription you wish me to see?"

"The inscription on the mummy cat in Mr. Trelawny's room."

Mr. Corbeck's face fell.  "No!" he said, "I cannot do that!  I am, for
the present at all events, practically bound to secrecy regarding any
of the things in Mr. Trelawny's room."

Doctor Winchester's comment and my own were made at the same moment.  I
said only the one word "Checkmate!" from which I think he may have
gathered that I guessed more of his idea and purpose than perhaps I had
intentionally conveyed to him.  He murmured:

"Practically bound to secrecy?"

Mr. Corbeck at once took up the challenge conveyed:

"Do not misunderstand me!  I am not bound by any definite pledge of
secrecy; but I am bound in honour to respect Mr. Trelawny's confidence,
given to me, I may tell you, in a very large measure.  Regarding many
of the objects in his room he has a definite purpose in view; and it
would not be either right or becoming for me, his trusted friend and
confidant, to forestall that purpose.  Mr. Trelawny, you may know--or
rather you do not know or you would not have so construed my remark--is
a scholar, a very great scholar.  He has worked for years toward a
certain end.  For this he has spared no labour, no expense, no personal
danger or self-denial.  He is on the line of a result which will place
him amongst the foremost discoverers or investigators of his age.  And
now, just at the time when any hour might bring him success, he is
stricken down!"

He stopped, seemingly overcome with emotion.  After a time he recovered
himself and went on:

"Again, do not misunderstand me as to another point.  I have said that
Mr. Trelawny has made much confidence with me; but I do not mean to
lead you to believe that I know all his plans, or his aims or objects.
I know the period which he has been studying; and the definite
historical individual whose life he has been investigating, and whose
records he has been following up one by one with infinite patience.
But beyond this I know nothing.  That he has some aim or object in the
completion of this knowledge I am convinced.  What it is I may guess;
but I must say nothing. Please to remember, gentlemen, that I have
voluntarily accepted the position of recipient of a partial confidence.
I have respected that; and I must ask any of my friends to do the same."

He spoke with great dignity; and he grew, moment by moment, in the
respect and esteem of both Doctor Winchester and myself.  We understood
that he had not done speaking; so we waited in silence till he
continued:

"I have spoken this much, although I know well that even such a hint as
either of you might gather from my words might jeopardise the success
of his work.  But I am convinced that you both wish to help him--and
his daughter," he said this looking me fairly between the eyes, "to the
best of your power, honestly and unselfishly.  He is so stricken down,
and the manner of it is so mysterious that I cannot but think that it
is in some way a result of his own work.  That he calculated on some
set-back is manifest to us all.  God knows! I am willing to do what I
can, and to use any knowledge I have in his behalf.  I arrived in
England full of exultation at the thought that I had fulfilled the
mission with which he had trusted me.  I had got what he said were the
last objects of his search; and I felt assured that he would now be
able to begin the experiment of which he had often hinted to me.  It is
too dreadful that at just such a time such a calamity should have
fallen on him.  Doctor Winchester, you are a physician; and, if your
face does not belie you, you are a clever and a bold one.  Is there no
way which you can devise to wake this man from his unnatural stupor?"

There was a pause; then the answer came slowly and deliberately:

"There is no ordinary remedy that I know of.  There might possibly be
some extraordinary one.  But there would be no use in trying to find
it, except on one condition."

"And that?"

"Knowledge!  I am completely ignorant of Egyptian matters, language,
writing, history, secrets, medicines, poisons, occult powers--all that
go to make up the mystery of that mysterious land.  This disease, or
condition, or whatever it may be called, from which Mr. Trelawny is
suffering, is in some way connected with Egypt.  I have had a suspicion
of this from the first; and later it grew into a certainty, though
without proof.  What you have said tonight confirms my conjecture, and
makes me believe that a proof is to be had.  I do not think that you
quite know all that has gone on in this house since the night of the
attack--of the finding of Mr. Trelawny's body. Now I propose that we
confide in you.  If Mr. Ross agrees, I shall ask him to tell you. He is
more skilled than I am in putting facts before other people.  He can
speak by his brief; and in this case he has the best of all briefs, the
experience of his own eyes and ears, and the evidence that he has
himself taken on the spot from participators in, or spectators of, what
has happened.  When you know all, you will, I hope, be in a position to
judge as to whether you can best help Mr. Trelawny, and further his
secret wishes, by your silence or your speech."

I nodded approval.  Mr. Corbeck jumped up, and in his impulsive way
held out a hand to each.

"Done!" he said.  "I acknowledge the honour of your confidence; and on
my part I pledge myself that if I find my duty to Mr. Trelawny's wishes
will, in his own interest, allow my lips to open on his affairs, I
shall speak so freely as I may."

Accordingly I began, and told him, as exactly as I could, everything
that had happened from the moment of my waking at the knocking on the
door in Jermyn Street.  The only reservations I made were as to my own
feeling toward Miss Trelawny and the matters of small import to the
main subject which followed it; and my conversations with Sergeant Daw,
which were in themselves private, and which would have demanded
discretionary silence in any case.  As I spoke, Mr. Corbeck followed
with breathless interest.  Sometimes he would stand up and pace about
the room in uncontrollable excitement; and then recover himself
suddenly, and sit down again.  Sometimes he would be about to speak,
but would, with an effort, restrain himself.  I think the narration
helped me to make up my own mind; for even as I talked, things seemed
to appear in a clearer light.  Things big and little, in relation of
their importance to the case, fell into proper perspective.  The story
up to date became coherent, except as to its cause, which seemed a
greater mystery than ever.  This is the merit of entire, or collected,
narrative.  Isolated facts, doubts, suspicions, conjectures, give way
to a homogeneity which is convincing.

That Mr. Corbeck was convinced was evident.  He did not go through any
process of explanation or limitation, but spoke right out at once to
the point, and fearlessly like a man:

"That settles me!  There is in activity some Force that needs special
care.  If we all go on working in the dark we shall get in one
another's way, and by hampering each other, undo the good that any or
each of us, working in different directions, might do.  It seems to me
that the first thing we have to accomplish is to get Mr. Trelawny waked
out of that unnatural sleep.  That he can be waked is apparent from the
way the Nurse has recovered; though what additional harm may have been
done to him in the time he has been lying in that room I suppose no one
can tell.  We must chance that, however.  He has lain there, and
whatever the effect might be, it is there now; and we have, and shall
have, to deal with it as a fact.  A day more or less won't hurt in the
long-run. It is late now; and we shall probably have tomorrow a task
before us that will require our energies afresh.  You, Doctor, will
want to get to your sleep; for I suppose you have other work as well as
this to do tomorrow.  As for you, Mr. Ross, I understand that you are
to have a spell of watching in the sick-room tonight.  I shall get you
a book which will help to pass the time for you.  I shall go and look
for it in the library.  I know where it was when I was here last; and I
don't suppose Mr. Trelawny has used it since.  He knew long ago all
that was in it which was or might be of interest to him.  But it will
be necessary, or at least helpful, to understand other things which I
shall tell you later.  You will be able to tell Doctor Winchester all
that would aid him.  For I take it that our work will branch out pretty
soon. We shall each have our own end to hold up; and it will take each
of us all our time and understanding to get through his own tasks.  It
will not be necessary for you to read the whole book.  All that will
interest you--with regard to our matter I mean of course, for the whole
book is interesting as a record of travel in a country then quite
unknown--is the preface, and two or three chapters which I shall mark
for you."

He shook hands warmly with Doctor Winchester who had stood up to go.

Whilst he was away I sat lonely, thinking.  As I thought, the world
around me seemed to be illimitably great.  The only little spot in
which I was interested seemed like a tiny speck in the midst of a
wilderness. Without and around it were darkness and unknown danger,
pressing in from every side.  And the central figure in our little
oasis was one of sweetness and beauty.  A figure one could love; could
work for; could die for...!

Mr. Corbeck came back in a very short time with the book; he had found
it at once in the spot where he had seen it three years before.  Having
placed in it several slips of paper, marking the places where I was to
read, he put it into my hands, saying:

"That is what started Mr. Trelawny; what started me when I read it; and
which will, I have no doubt, be to you an interesting beginning to a
special study--whatever the end may be.  If, indeed, any of us here may
ever see the end."

At the door he paused and said:

"I want to take back one thing.  That Detective is a good fellow.  What
you have told me of him puts him in a new light.  The best proof of it
is that I can go quietly to sleep tonight, and leave the lamps in his
care!"

When he had gone I took the book with me, put on my respirator, and
went to my spell of duty in the sick-room!




Chapter X

The Valley of the Sorcerer


I placed the book on the little table on which the shaded lamp rested
and moved the screen to one side.  Thus I could have the light on my
book; and by looking up, see the bed, and the Nurse, and the door.  I
cannot say that the conditions were enjoyable, or calculated to allow
of that absorption in the subject which is advisable for effective
study. However, I composed myself to the work as well as I could.  The
book was one which, on the very face of it, required special attention.
It was a folio in Dutch, printed in Amsterdam in 1650.  Some one had
made a literal translation, writing generally the English word under
the Dutch, so that the grammatical differences between the two tongues
made even the reading of the translation a difficult matter.  One had
to dodge backward and forward among the words.  This was in addition to
the difficulty of deciphering a strange handwriting of two hundred
years ago.  I found, however, that after a short time I got into the
habit of following in conventional English the Dutch construction; and,
as I became more familiar with the writing, my task became easier.

At first the circumstances of the room, and the fear lest Miss Trelawny
should return unexpectedly and find me reading the book, disturbed me
somewhat.  For we had arranged amongst us, before Doctor Winchester had
gone home, that she was not to be brought into the range of the coming
investigation.  We considered that there might be some shock to a
woman's mind in matters of apparent mystery; and further, that she,
being Mr. Trelawny's daughter, might be placed in a difficult position
with him afterward if she took part in, or even had a personal
knowledge of, the disregarding of his expressed wishes.  But when I
remembered that she did not come on nursing duty till two o'clock, the
fear of interruption passed away.  I had still nearly three house
before me. Nurse Kennedy sat in her chair by the bedside, patient and
alert.  A clock ticked on the landing; other clocks in the house
ticked; the life of the city without manifested itself in the distant
hum, now and again swelling into a roar as a breeze floating westward
took the concourse of sounds with it.  But still the dominant idea was
of silence.  The light on my book, and the soothing fringe of green
silk round the shade intensified, whenever I looked up, the gloom of
the sick-room.  With every line I read, this seemed to grow deeper and
deeper; so that when my eyes came back to the page the light seemed to
dazzle me.  I stuck to my work, however, and presently began to get
sufficiently into the subject to become interested in it.

The book was by one Nicholas van Huyn of Hoorn.  In the preface he told
how, attracted by the work of John Greaves of Merton College,
Pyramidographia, he himself visited Egypt, where he became so
interested in its wonders that he devoted some years of his life to
visiting strange places, and exploring the ruins of many temples and
tombs.  He had come across many variants of the story of the building
of the Pyramids as told by the Arabian historian, Ibn Abd Alhokin, some
of which he set down.  These I did not stop to read, but went on to the
marked pages.

As soon as I began to read these, however, there grew on me some sense
of a disturbing influence.  Once or twice I looked to see if the Nurse
had moved, for there was a feeling as though some one were near me.
Nurse Kennedy sat in her place, as steady and alert as ever; and I came
back to my book again.

The narrative went on to tell how, after passing for several days
through the mountains to the east of Aswan, the explorer came to a
certain place.  Here I give his own words, simply putting the
translation into modern English:

"Toward evening we came to the entrance of a narrow, deep valley,
running east and west.  I wished to proceed through this; for the sun,
now nearly down on the horizon, showed a wide opening beyond the
narrowing of the cliffs.  But the fellaheen absolutely refused to enter
the valley at such a time, alleging that they might be caught by the
night before they could emerge from the other end.  At first they would
give no reason for their fear.  They had hitherto gone anywhere I
wished, and at any time, without demur.  On being pressed, however,
they said that the place was the Valley of the Sorcerer, where none
might come in the night.  On being asked to tell of the Sorcerer, they
refused, saying that there was no name, and that they knew nothing.  On
the next morning, however, when the sun was up and shining down the
valley, their fears had somewhat passed away.  Then they told me that a
great Sorcerer in ancient days--'millions of millions of years' was the
term they used--a King or a Queen, they could not say which, was buried
there.  They could not give the name, persisting to the last that there
was no name; and that anyone who should name it would waste away in
life so that at death nothing of him would remain to be raised again in
the Other World.  In passing through the valley they kept together in a
cluster, hurrying on in front of me.  None dared to remain behind. They
gave, as their reason for so proceeding, that the arms of the Sorcerer
were long, and that it was dangerous to be the last.  The which was of
little comfort to me who of this necessity took that honourable post.
In the narrowest part of the valley, on the south side, was a great
cliff of rock, rising sheer, of smooth and even surface. Hereon were
graven certain cabalistic signs, and many figures of men and animals,
fishes, reptiles and birds; suns and stars; and many quaint symbols.
Some of these latter were disjointed limbs and features, such as arms
and legs, fingers, eyes, noses, ears, and lips.  Mysterious symbols
which will puzzle the Recording Angel to interpret at the Judgment Day.
The cliff faced exactly north.  There was something about it so
strange, and so different from the other carved rocks which I had
visited, that I called a halt and spent the day in examining the rock
front as well as I could with my telescope.  The Egyptians of my
company were terribly afraid, and used every kind of persuasion to
induce me to pass on.  I stayed till late in the afternoon, by which
time I had failed to make out aright the entry of any tomb, for I
suspected that such was the purpose of the sculpture of the rock.  By
this time the men were rebellious; and I had to leave the valley if I
did not wish my whole retinue to desert.  But I secretly made up my
mind to discover the tomb, and explore it.  To this end I went further
into the mountains, where I met with an Arab Sheik who was willing to
take service with me.  The Arabs were not bound by the same
superstitious fears as the Egyptians; Sheik Abu Some and his following
were willing to take a part in the explorations.

"When I returned to the valley with these Bedouins, I made effort to
climb the face of the rock, but failed, it being of one impenetrable
smoothness.  The stone, generally flat and smooth by nature, had been
chiselled to completeness.  That there had been projecting steps was
manifest, for there remained, untouched by the wondrous climate of that
strange land, the marks of saw and chisel and mallet where the steps
had been cut or broken away.

"Being thus baffled of winning the tomb from below, and being
unprovided with ladders to scale, I found a way by much circuitous
journeying to the top of the cliff. Thence I caused myself to be
lowered by ropes, till I had investigated that portion of the rock face
wherein I expected to find the opening.  I found that there was an
entrance, closed however by a great stone slab.  This was cut in the
rock more than a hundred feet up, being two-thirds the height of the
cliff.  The hieroglyphic and cabalistic symbols cut in the rock were so
managed as to disguise it. The cutting was deep, and was continued
through the rock and the portals of the doorway, and through the great
slab which formed the door itself. This was fixed in place with such
incredible exactness that no stone chisel or cutting implement which I
had with me could find a lodgment in the interstices.  I used much
force, however; and by many heavy strokes won a way into the tomb, for
such I found it to be.  The stone door having fallen into the entrance
I passed over it into the tomb, noting as I went a long iron chain
which hung coiled on a bracket close to the doorway.

"The tomb I found to be complete, after the manner of the finest
Egyptian tombs, with chamber and shaft leading down to the corridor,
ending in the Mummy Pit.  It had the table of pictures, which seems
some kind of record--whose meaning is now for ever lost--graven in a
wondrous colour on a wondrous stone.

"All the walls of the chamber and the passage were carved with strange
writings in the uncanny form mentioned.  The huge stone coffin or
sarcophagus in the deep pit was marvellously graven throughout with
signs.  The Arab chief and two others who ventured into the tomb with
me, and who were evidently used to such grim explorations, managed to
take the cover from the sarcophagus without breaking it. At which they
wondered; for such good fortune, they said, did not usually attend such
efforts.  Indeed they seemed not over careful; and did handle the
various furniture of the tomb with such little concern that, only for
its great strength and thickness, even the coffin itself might have
been injured.  Which gave me much concern, for it was very beautifully
wrought of rare stone, such as I had no knowledge of.  Much I grieved
that it were not possible to carry it away.  But time and desert
journeyings forbade such; I could only take with me such small matters
as could be carried on the person.

"Within the sarcophagus was a body, manifestly of a woman, swathed with
many wrappings of linen, as is usual with all mummies.  From certain
embroiderings thereon, I gathered that she was of high rank.  Across
the breast was one hand, unwrapped.  In the mummies which I had seen,
the arms and hands are within the wrappings, and certain adornments of
wood, shaped and painted to resemble arms and hands, lie outside the
enwrapped body.

"But this hand was strange to see, for it was the real hand of her who
lay enwrapped there; the arm projecting from the cerements being of
flesh, seemingly made as like marble in the process of embalming.  Arm
and hand were of dusky white, being of the hue of ivory that hath lain
long in air.  The skin and the nails were complete and whole, as though
the body had been placed for burial over night.  I touched the hand and
moved it, the arm being something flexible as a live arm; though stiff
with long disuse, as are the arms of those faqueers which I have seen
in the Indees.  There was, too, an added wonder that on this ancient
hand were no less than seven fingers, the same all being fine and long,
and of great beauty.  Sooth to say, it made me shudder and my flesh
creep to touch that hand that had lain there undisturbed for so many
thousands of years, and yet was like unto living flesh.  Underneath the
hand, as though guarded by it, lay a huge jewel of ruby; a great stone
of wondrous bigness, for the ruby is in the main a small jewel.  This
one was of wondrous colour, being as of fine blood whereon the light
shineth.  But its wonder lay not in its size or colour, though these
were, as I have said, of priceless rarity; but in that the light of it
shone from seven stars, each of seven points, as clearly as though the
stars were in reality there imprisoned.  When that the hand was lifted,
the sight of that wondrous stone lying there struck me with a shock
almost to momentary paralysis.  I stood gazing on it, as did those with
me, as though it were that faded head of the Gorgon Medusa with the
snakes in her hair, whose sight struck into stone those who beheld.  So
strong was the feeling that I wanted to hurry away from the place.  So,
too, those with me; therefore, taking this rare jewel, together with
certain amulets of strangeness and richness being wrought of
jewel-stones, I made haste to depart.  I would have remained longer,
and made further research in the wrappings of the mummy, but that I
feared so to do.  For it came to me all at once that I was in a desert
place, with strange men who were with me because they were not
over-scrupulous. That we were in a lone cavern of the dead, an hundred
feet above the ground, where none could find me were ill done to me,
nor would any ever seek. But in secret I determined that I would come
again, though with more secure following.  Moreover, was I tempted to
seek further, as in examining the wrappings I saw many things of
strange import in that wondrous tomb; including a casket of eccentric
shape made of some strange stone, which methought might have contained
other jewels, inasmuch as it had secure lodgment in the great
sarcophagus itself. There was in the tomb also another coffer which,
though of rare proportion and adornment, was more simply shaped.  It
was of ironstone of great thickness; but the cover was lightly cemented
down with what seemed gum and Paris plaster, as though to insure that
no air could penetrate.  The Arabs with me so insisted in its opening,
thinking that from its thickness much treasure was stored therein, that
I consented thereto.  But their hope was a false one, as it proved.
Within, closely packed, stood four jars finely wrought and carved with
various adornments.  Of these one was the head of a man, another of a
dog, another of a jackal, and another of a hawk.  I had before known
that such burial urns as these were used to contain the entrails and
other organs of the mummied dead; but on opening these, for the
fastening of wax, though complete, was thin, and yielded easily, we
found that they held but oil.  The Bedouins, spilling most of the oil
in the process, groped with their hands in the jars lest treasure
should have been there concealed.  But their searching was of no avail;
no treasure was there. I was warned of my danger by seeing in the eyes
of the Arabs certain covetous glances.  Whereon, in order to hasten
their departure, I wrought upon those fears of superstition which even
in these callous men were apparent.  The chief of the Bedouins ascended
from the Pit to give the signal to those above to raise us; and I, not
caring to remain with the men whom I mistrusted, followed him
immediately.  The others did not come at once; from which I feared that
they were rifling the tomb afresh on their own account.  I refrained to
speak of it, however, lest worse should befall.  At last they came.
One of them, who ascended first, in landing at the top of the cliff
lost his foothold and fell below.  He was instantly killed.  The other
followed, but in safety. The chief came next, and I came last.  Before
coming away I pulled into its place again, as well as I could, the slab
of stone that covered the entrance to the tomb.  I wished, if possible,
to preserve it for my own examination should I come again.

"When we all stood on the hill above the cliff, the burning sun that
was bright and full of glory was good to see after the darkness and
strange mystery of the tomb. Even was I glad that the poor Arab who
fell down the cliff and lay dead below, lay in the sunlight and not in
that gloomy cavern.  I would fain have gone with my companions to seek
him and give him sepulture of some kind; but the Sheik made light of
it, and sent two of his men to see to it whilst we went on our way.

"That night as we camped, one of the men only returned, saying that a
lion of the desert had killed his companion after that they had buried
the dead man in a deep sand without the valley, and had covered the
spot where he lay with many great rocks, so that jackals or other
preying beasts might not dig him up again as is their wont.

"Later, in the light of the fire round which the men sat or lay, I saw
him exhibit to his fellows something white which they seemed to regard
with special awe and reverence.  So I drew near silently, and saw that
it was none other than the white hand of the mummy which had lain
protecting the Jewel in the great sarcophagus. I heard the Bedouin tell
how he had found it on the body of him who had fallen from the cliff.
There was no mistaking it, for there were the seven fingers which I had
noted before.  This man must have wrenched it off the dead body whilst
his chief and I were otherwise engaged; and from the awe of the others
I doubted not that he had hoped to use it as an Amulet, or charm.
Whereas if powers it had, they were not for him who had taken it from
the dead; since his death followed hard upon his theft.  Already his
Amulet had had an awesome baptism; for the wrist of the dead hand was
stained with red as though it had been dipped in recent blood.

"That night I was in certain fear lest there should be some violence
done to me; for if the poor dead hand was so valued as a charm, what
must be the worth in such wise of the rare Jewel which it had guarded.
Though only the chief knew of it, my doubt was perhaps even greater;
for he could so order matters as to have me at his mercy when he would.
I guarded myself, therefore, with wakefulness so well as I could,
determined that at my earliest opportunity I should leave this party,
and complete my journeying home, first to the Nile bank, and then down
its course to Alexandria; with other guides who knew not what strange
matters I had with me.

"At last there came over me a disposition of sleep, so potent that I
felt it would be resistless.  Fearing attack, or that being searched in
my sleep the Bedouin might find the Star Jewel which he had seen me
place with others in my dress, I took it out unobserved and held it in
my hand.  It seemed to give back the light of the flickering fire and
the light of the stars--for there was no moon--with equal fidelity; and
I could note that on its reverse it was graven deeply with certain
signs such as I had seen in the tomb.  As I sank into the
unconsciousness of sleep, the graven Star Jewel was hidden in the
hollow of my clenched hand.

"I waked out of sleep with the light of the morning sun on my face.  I
sat up and looked around me.  The fire was out, and the camp was
desolate; save for one figure which lay prone close to me.  It was that
of the Arab chief, who lay on his back, dead.  His face was almost
black; and his eyes were open, and staring horribly up at the sky, as
though he saw there some dreadful vision.  He had evidently been
strangled; for on looking, I found on his throat the red marks where
fingers had pressed.  There seemed so many of these marks that I
counted them.  There were seven; and all parallel, except the thumb
mark, as though made with one hand.  This thrilled me as I thought of
the mummy hand with the seven fingers.

"Even there, in the open desert, it seemed as if there could be
enchantments!

"In my surprise, as I bent over him, I opened my right hand, which up
to now I had held shut with the feeling, instinctive even in sleep, of
keeping safe that which it held.  As I did so, the Star Jewel held
there fell out and struck the dead man on the mouth.  Mirabile dictu
there came forth at once from the dead mouth a great gush of blood, in
which the red jewel was for the moment lost.  I turned the dead man
over to look for it, and found that he lay with his right hand bent
under him as though he had fallen on it; and in it he held a great
knife, keen of point and edge, such as Arabs carry at the belt.  It may
have been that he was about to murder me when vengeance came on him,
whether from man or God, or the Gods of Old, I know not.  Suffice it,
that when I found my Ruby Jewel, which shone up as a living star from
the mess of blood wherein it lay, I paused not, but fled from the
place. I journeyed on alone through the hot desert, till, by God's
grace, I came upon an Arab tribe camping by a well, who gave me salt.
With them I rested till they had set me on my way.

"I know not what became of the mummy hand, or of those who had it.
What strife, or suspicion, or disaster, or greed went with it I know
not; but some such cause there must have been, since those who had it
fled with it.  It doubtless is used as a charm of potence by some
desert tribe.

"At the earliest opportunity I made examination of the Star Ruby, as I
wished to try to understand what was graven on it.  The symbols--whose
meaning, however, I could not understand--were as follows..."

Twice, whilst I had been reading this engrossing narrative, I had
thought that I had seen across the page streaks of shade, which the
weirdness of the subject had made to seem like the shadow of a hand.
On the first of these occasions I found that the illusion came from the
fringe of green silk around the lamp; but on the second I had looked
up, and my eyes had lit on the mummy hand across the room on which the
starlight was falling under the edge of the blind.  It was of little
wonder that I had connected it with such a narrative; for if my eyes
told me truly, here, in this room with me, was the very hand of which
the traveller Van Huyn had written.  I looked over at the bed; and it
comforted me to think that the Nurse still sat there, calm and wakeful.
At such a time, with such surrounds, during such a narrative, it was
well to have assurance of the presence of some living person.

I sat looking at the book on the table before me; and so many strange
thoughts crowded on me that my mind began to whirl.  It was almost as
if the light on the white fingers in front of me was beginning to have
some hypnotic effect.  All at once, all thoughts seemed to stop; and
for an instant the world and time stood still.

There lay a real hand across the book!  What was there to so overcome
me, as was the case?  I knew the hand that I saw on the book--and loved
it.  Margaret Trelawny's hand was a joy to me to see--to touch; and yet
at that moment, coming after other marvellous things, it had a
strangely moving effect on me.  It was but momentary, however, and had
passed even before her voice had reached me.

"What disturbs you?  What are you staring at the book for?  I thought
for an instant that you must have been overcome again!"  I jumped up.

"I was reading," I said, "an old book from the library."  As I spoke I
closed it and put it under my arm.  "I shall now put it back, as I
understand that your Father wishes all things, especially books, kept
in their proper places."  My words were intentionally misleading; for I
did not wish her to know what I was reading, and thought it best not to
wake her curiosity by leaving the book about.  I went away, but not to
the library; I left the book in my room where I could get it when I had
had my sleep in the day.  When I returned Nurse Kennedy was ready to go
to bed; so Miss Trelawny watched with me in the room.  I did not want
any book whilst she was present.  We sat close together and talked in a
whisper whilst the moments flew by.  It was with surprise that I noted
the edge of the curtains changing from grey to yellow light. What we
talked of had nothing to do with the sick man, except in so far that
all which concerned his daughter must ultimately concern him.  But it
had nothing to say to Egypt, or mummies, or the dead, or caves, or
Bedouin chiefs.  I could well take note in the growing light that
Margaret's hand had not seven fingers, but five; for it lay in mine.

When Doctor Winchester arrived in the morning and had made his visit to
his patient, he came to see me as I sat in the dining-room having a
little meal--breakfast or supper, I hardly knew which it was--before I
went to lie down.  Mr. Corbeck came in at the same time; and we resumed
out conversation where we had left it the night before.  I told Mr.
Corbeck that I had read the chapter about the finding of the tomb, and
that I thought Doctor Winchester should read it, too.  The latter said
that, if he might, he would take it with him; he had that morning to
make a railway journey to Ipswich, and would read it on the train.  He
said he would bring it back with him when he came again in the evening.
I went up to my room to bring it down; but I could not find it
anywhere. I had a distinct recollection of having left it on the little
table beside my bed, when I had come up after Miss Trelawny's going on
duty into the sick-room.  It was very strange; for the book was not of
a kind that any of the servants would be likely to take.  I had to come
back and explain to the others that I could not find it.

When Doctor Winchester had gone, Mr. Corbeck, who seemed to know the
Dutchman's work by heart, talked the whole matter over with me.  I told
him that I was interrupted by a change of nurses, just as I had come to
the description of the ring.  He smiled as he said:

"So far as that is concerned, you need not be disappointed.  Not in Van
Huyn's time, nor for nearly two centuries later, could the meaning of
that engraving have been understood.  It was only when the work was
taken up and followed by Young and Champollion, by Birch and Lepsius
and Rosellini and Salvolini, by Mariette Bey and by Wallis Budge and
Flinders Petrie and the other scholars of their times that great
results ensued, and that the true meaning of hieroglyphic was known.

"Later, I shall explain to you, if Mr. Trelawny does not explain it
himself, or if he does not forbid me to, what it means in that
particular place.  I think it will be better for you to know what
followed Van Huyn's narrative; for with the description of the stone,
and the account of his bringing it to Holland at the termination of his
travels, the episode ends.  Ends so far as his book is concerned.  The
chief thing about the book is that it sets others thinking--and acting.
Amongst them were Mr. Trelawny and myself.  Mr. Trelawny is a good
linguist of the Orient, but he does not know Northern tongues.  As for
me I have a faculty for learning languages; and when I was pursuing my
studies in Leyden I learned Dutch so that I might more easily make
references in the library there.  Thus it was, that at the very time
when Mr. Trelawny, who, in making his great collection of works on
Egypt, had, through a booksellers' catalogue, acquired this volume with
the manuscript translation, was studying it, I was reading another
copy, in original Dutch, in Leyden.  We were both struck by the
description of the lonely tomb in the rock; cut so high up as to be
inaccessible to ordinary seekers:  with all means of reaching it
carefully obliterated; and yet with such an elaborate ornamentation of
the smoothed surface of the cliff as Van Huyn has described.  It also
struck us both as an odd thing--for in the years between Van Huyn's
time and our own the general knowledge of Egyptian curios and records
has increased marvellously--that in the case of such a tomb, made in
such a place, and which must have cost an immense sum of money, there
was no seeming record or effigy to point out who lay within.  Moreover,
the very name of the place, 'the Valley of the Sorcerer', had, in a
prosaic age, attractions of its own. When we met, which we did through
his seeking the assistance of other Egyptologists in his work, we
talked over this as we did over many other things; and we determined to
make search for the mysterious valley. Whilst we were waiting to start
on the travel, for many things were required which Mr. Trelawny
undertook to see to himself, I went to Holland to try if I could by any
traces verify Van Huyn's narrative.  I went straight to Hoorn, and set
patiently to work to find the house of the traveller and his
descendants, if any.  I need not trouble you with details of my
seeking--and finding. Hoorn is a place that has not changed much since
Van Huyn's time, except that it has lost the place which it held
amongst commercial cities.  Its externals are such as they had been
then; in such a sleepy old place a century or two does not count for
much.  I found the house, and discovered that none of the descendants
were alive. I searched records; but only to one end--death and
extinction.  Then I set me to work to find what had become of his
treasures; for that such a traveller must have had great treasures was
apparent.  I traced a good many to museums in Leyden, Utrecht, and
Amsterdam; and some few to the private houses of rich collectors.  At
last, in the shop of an old watchmaker and jeweller at Hoorn, I found
what he considered his chiefest treasure; a great ruby, carven like a
scarab, with seven stars, and engraven with hieroglyphics.  The old man
did not know hieroglyphic character, and in his old-world, sleepy life,
the philological discoveries of recent years had not reached him.  He
did not know anything of Van Huyn, except that such a person had been,
and that his name was, during two centuries, venerated in the town as a
great traveller.  He valued the jewel as only a rare stone, spoiled in
part by the cutting; and though he was at first loth to part with such
an unique gem, he became amenable ultimately to commercial reason.  I
had a full purse, since I bought for Mr. Trelawny, who is, as I suppose
you know, immensely wealthy.  I was shortly on my way back to London,
with the Star Ruby safe in my pocket-book; and in my heart a joy and
exultation which knew no bounds.

"For here we were with proof of Van Huyn's wonderful story.  The jewel
was put in security in Mr. Trelawny's great safe; and we started out on
our journey of exploration in full hope.

"Mr. Trelawny was, at the last, loth to leave his young wife whom he
dearly loved; but she, who loved him equally, knew his longing to
prosecute the search.  So keeping to herself, as all good women do, all
her anxieties--which in her case were special--she bade him follow out
his bent."




Chapter XI

A Queen's Tomb


"Mr. Trelawny's hope was at least as great as my own.  He is not so
volatile a man as I am, prone to ups and downs of hope and despair; but
he has a fixed purpose which crystallises hope into belief.  At times I
had feared that there might have been two such stones, or that the
adventures of Van Huyn were traveller's fictions, based on some
ordinary acquisition of the curio in Alexandria or Cairo, or London or
Amsterdam. But Mr. Trelawny never faltered in his belief.  We had many
things to distract our minds from belief or disbelief.  This was soon
after Arabi Pasha, and Egypt was so safe place for travellers,
especially if they were English.  But Mr. Trelawny is a fearless man;
and I almost come to think at times that I am not a coward myself.  We
got together a band of Arabs whom one or other of us had known in
former trips to the desert, and whom we could trust; that is, we did
not distrust them as much as others.  We were numerous enough to
protect ourselves from chance marauding bands, and we took with us
large impedimenta.  We had secured the consent and passive co-operation
of the officials still friendly to Britain; in the acquiring of which
consent I need hardly say that Mr. Trelawny's riches were of chief
importance.  We found our way in dhahabiyehs to Aswan; whence, having
got some Arabs from the Sheik and having given our usual backsheesh, we
set out on our journey through the desert.

"Well, after much wandering and trying every winding in the
interminable jumble of hills, we came at last at nightfall on just such
a valley as Van Huyn had described. A valley with high, steep cliffs;
narrowing in the centre, and widening out to the eastern and western
ends.  At daylight we were opposite the cliff and could easily note the
opening high up in the rock, and the hieroglyphic figures which were
evidently intended originally to conceal it.

"But the signs which had baffled Van Huyn and those of his time--and
later, were no secrets to us.  The host of scholars who have given
their brains and their lives to this work, had wrested open the
mysterious prison-house of Egyptian language.  On the hewn face of the
rocky cliff we, who had learned the secrets, could read what the Theban
priesthood had had there inscribed nearly fifty centuries before.

"For that the external inscription was the work of the priesthood--and
a hostile priesthood at that--there could be no living doubt.  The
inscription on the rock, written in hieroglyphic, ran thus:

"'Hither the Gods come not at any summons.  The "Nameless One" has
insulted them and is for ever alone.  Go not nigh, lest their vengeance
wither you away!'

"The warning must have been a terribly potent one at the time it was
written and for thousands of years afterwards; even when the language
in which it was given had become a dead mystery to the people of the
land. The tradition of such a terror lasts longer than its cause.  Even
in the symbols used there was an added significance of alliteration.
'For ever' is given in the hieroglyphics as 'millions of years'.  This
symbol was repeated nine times, in three groups of three; and after
each group a symbol of the Upper World, the Under World, and the Sky.
So that for this Lonely One there could be, through the vengeance of
all the Gods, resurrection in neither the World of Sunlight, in the
World of the Dead, or for the soul in the region of the Gods.

"Neither Mr. Trelawny nor I dared to tell any of our people what the
writing meant. For though they did not believe in the religion whence
the curse came, or in the Gods whose vengeance was threatened, yet they
were so superstitious that they would probably, had they known of it,
have thrown up the whole task and run away.

"Their ignorance, however, and our discretion preserved us.  We made an
encampment close at hand, but behind a jutting rock a little further
along the valley, so that they might not have the inscription always
before them.  For even that traditional name of the place:  'The Valley
of the Sorcerer', had a fear for them; and for us through them.  With
the timber which we had brought, we made a ladder up the face of the
rock.  We hung a pulley on a beam fixed to project from the top of the
cliff.  We found the great slab of rock, which formed the door, placed
clumsily in its place and secured by a few stones.  Its own weight kept
it in safe position.  In order to enter, we had to push it in; and we
passed over it.  We found the great coil of chain which Van Huyn had
described fastened into the rock.  There were, however, abundant
evidences amid the wreckage of the great stone door, which had revolved
on iron hinges at top and bottom, that ample provision had been
originally made for closing and fastening it from within.

"Mr. Trelawny and I went alone into the tomb.  We had brought plenty of
lights with us; and we fixed them as we went along.  We wished to get a
complete survey at first, and then make examination of all in detail.
As we went on, we were filled with ever-increasing wonder and delight.
The tomb was one of the most magnificent and beautiful which either of
us had ever seen.  From the elaborate nature of the sculpture and
painting, and the perfection of the workmanship, it was evident that
the tomb was prepared during the lifetime of her for whose
resting-place it was intended.  The drawing of the hieroglyphic
pictures was fine, and the colouring superb; and in that high cavern,
far away from even the damp of the Nile-flood, all was as fresh as when
the artists had laid down their palettes.  There was one thing which we
could not avoid seeing.  That although the cutting on the outside rock
was the work of the priesthood, the smoothing of the cliff face was
probably a part of the tomb-builder's original design.  The symbolism
of the painting and cutting within all gave the same idea.  The outer
cavern, partly natural and partly hewn, was regarded architecturally as
only an ante-chamber. At the end of it, so that it would face the east,
was a pillared portico, hewn out of the solid rock.  The pillars were
massive and were seven-sided, a thing which we had not come across in
any other tomb. Sculptured on the architrave was the Boat of the Moon,
containing Hathor, cow-headed and bearing the disk and plumes, and the
dog-headed Hapi, the God of the North.  It was steered by Harpocrates
towards the north, represented by the Pole Star surrounded by Draco and
Ursa Major. In the latter the stars that form what we call the 'Plough'
were cut larger than any of the other stars; and were filled with gold
so that, in the light of torches, they seemed to flame with a special
significance. Passing within the portico, we found two of the
architectural features of a rock tomb, the Chamber, or Chapel, and the
Pit, all complete as Van Huyn had noticed, though in his day the names
given to these parts by the Egyptians of old were unknown.

"The Stele, or record, which had its place low down on the western
wall, was so remarkable that we examined it minutely, even before going
on our way to find the mummy which was the object of our search.  This
Stele was a great slab of lapis lazuli, cut all over with hieroglyphic
figures of small size and of much beauty.  The cutting was filled in
with some cement of exceeding fineness, and of the colour of pure
vermilion.  The inscription began:

"'Tera, Queen of the Egypts, daughter of Antef, Monarch of the North
and the South.' 'Daughter of the Sun,' 'Queen of the Diadems'.

"It then set out, in full record, the history of her life and reign.

"The signs of sovereignty were given with a truly feminine profusion of
adornment. The united Crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt were, in
especial, cut with exquisite precision.  It was new to us both to find
the Hejet and the Desher--the White and the Red crowns of Upper and
Lower Egypt--on the Stele of a queen; for it was a rule, without
exception in the records, that in ancient Egypt either crown was worn
only by a king; though they are to be found on goddesses.  Later on we
found an explanation, of which I shall say more presently.

"Such an inscription was in itself a matter so startling as to arrest
attention from anyone anywhere at any time; but you can have no
conception of the effect which it had upon us.  Though our eyes were
not the first which had seen it, they were the first which could see it
with understanding since first the slab of rock was fixed in the cliff
opening nearly five thousand years before.  To us was given to read
this message from the dead.  This message of one who had warred against
the Gods of Old, and claimed to have controlled them at a time when the
hierarchy professed to be the only means of exciting their fears or
gaining their good will.

"The walls of the upper chamber of the Pit and the sarcophagus Chamber
were profusely inscribed; all the inscriptions, except that on the
Stele, being coloured with bluish-green pigment.  The effect when seen
sideways as the eye caught the green facets, was that of an old,
discoloured Indian turquoise.

"We descended the Pit by the aid of the tackle we had brought with us.
Trelawny went first.  It was a deep pit, more than seventy feet; but it
had never been filled up. The passage at the bottom sloped up to the
sarcophagus Chamber, and was longer than is usually found.  It had not
been walled up.

"Within, we found a great sarcophagus of yellow stone.  But that I need
not describe; you have seen it in Mr. Trelawny's chamber.  The cover of
it lay on the ground; it had not been cemented, and was just as Van
Huyn had described it.  Needless to say, we were excited as we looked
within. There must, however, be one sense of disappointment.  I could
not help feeling how different must have been the sight which met the
Dutch traveller's eyes when he looked within and found that white hand
lying lifelike above the shrouding mummy cloths.  It is true that a
part of the arm was there, white and ivory like.

"But there was a thrill to us which came not to Van Huyn!

"The end of the wrist was covered with dried blood!  It was as though
the body had bled after death!  The jagged ends of the broken wrist
were rough with the clotted blood; through this the white bone,
sticking out, looked like the matrix of opal.  The blood had streamed
down and stained the brown wrappings as with rust.  Here, then, was
full confirmation of the narrative.  With such evidence of the
narrator's truth before us, we could not doubt the other matters which
he had told, such as the blood on the mummy hand, or marks of the seven
fingers on the throat of the strangled Sheik.

"I shall not trouble you with details of all we saw, or how we learned
all we knew. Part of it was from knowledge common to scholars; part we
read on the Stele in the tomb, and in the sculptures and hieroglyphic
paintings on the walls.

"Queen Tera was of the Eleventh, or Theban Dynasty of Egyptian Kings
which held sway between the twenty-ninth and twenty-fifth centuries
before Christ.  She succeeded as the only child of her father, Antef.
She must have been a girl of extraordinary character as well as
ability, for she was but a young girl when her father died.  Her youth
and sex encouraged the ambitious priesthood, which had then achieved
immense power.  By their wealth and numbers and learning they dominated
all Egypt, more especially the Upper portion.  They were then secretly
ready to make an effort for the achievement of their bold and
long-considered design, that of transferring the governing power from a
Kingship to a Hierarchy. But King Antef had suspected some such
movement, and had taken the precaution of securing to his daughter the
allegiance of the army.  He had also had her taught statecraft, and had
even made her learned in the lore of the very priests themselves. He
had used those of one cult against the other; each being hopeful of
some present gain on its own part by the influence of the King, or of
some ultimate gain from its own influence over his daughter.  Thus, the
Princess had been brought up amongst scribes, and was herself no mean
artist.  Many of these things were told on the walls in pictures or in
hieroglyphic writing of great beauty; and we came to the conclusion
that not a few of them had been done by the Princess herself.  It was
not without cause that she was inscribed on the Stele as 'Protector of
the Arts'.

"But the King had gone to further lengths, and had had his daughter
taught magic, by which she had power over Sleep and Will.  This was
real magic--"black" magic; not the magic of the temples, which, I may
explain, was of the harmless or "white" order, and was intended to
impress rather than to effect.  She had been an apt pupil; and had gone
further than her teachers.  Her power and her resources had given her
great opportunities, of which she had availed herself to the full.  She
had won secrets from nature in strange ways; and had even gone to the
length of going down into the tomb herself, having been swathed and
coffined and left as dead for a whole month. The priests had tried to
make out that the real Princess Tera had died in the experiment, and
that another girl had been substituted; but she had conclusively proved
their error. All this was told in pictures of great merit.  It was
probably in her time that the impulse was given in the restoring the
artistic greatness of the Fourth Dynasty which had found its perfection
in the days of Chufu.

"In the Chamber of the sarcophagus were pictures and writings to show
that she had achieved victory over Sleep.  Indeed, there was everywhere
a symbolism, wonderful even in a land and an age of symbolism.
Prominence was given to the fact that she, though a Queen, claimed all
the privileges of kingship and masculinity.  In one place she was
pictured in man's dress, and wearing the White and Red Crowns.  In the
following picture she was in female dress, but still wearing the Crowns
of Upper and Lower Egypt, while the discarded male raiment lay at her
feet.  In every picture where hope, or aim, of resurrection was
expressed there was the added symbol of the North; and in many
places--always in representations of important events, past, present,
or future--was a grouping of the stars of the Plough.  She evidently
regarded this constellation as in some way peculiarly associated with
herself.

"Perhaps the most remarkable statement in the records, both on the
Stele and in the mural writings, was that Queen Tera had power to
compel the Gods.  This, by the way, was not an isolated belief in
Egyptian history; but was different in its cause.  She had engraved on
a ruby, carved like a scarab, and having seven stars of seven points,
Master Words to compel all the Gods, both of the Upper and the Under
Worlds.

"In the statement it was plainly set forth that the hatred of the
priests was, she knew, stored up for her, and that they would after her
death try to suppress her name.  This was a terrible revenge, I may
tell you, in Egyptian mythology; for without a name no one can after
death be introduced to the Gods, or have prayers said for him.
Therefore, she had intended her resurrection to be after a long time
and in a more northern land, under the constellation whose seven stars
had ruled her birth.  To this end, her hand was to be in the
air--'unwrapped'--and in it the Jewel of Seven Stars, so that wherever
there was air she might move even as her Ka could move!  This, after
thinking it over, Mr. Trelawny and I agreed meant that her body could
become astral at command, and so move, particle by particle, and become
whole again when and where required. Then there was a piece of writing
in which allusion was made to a chest or casket in which were contained
all the Gods, and Will, and Sleep, the two latter being personified by
symbols.  The box was mentioned as with seven sides. It was not much of
a surprise to us when, underneath the feet of the mummy, we found the
seven-sided casket, which you have also seen in Mr. Trelawny's room.
On the underneath part of the wrapping--linen of the left foot was
painted, in the same vermilion colour as that used in the Stele, the
hieroglyphic symbol for much water, and underneath the right foot the
symbol of the earth.  We made out the symbolism to be that her body,
immortal and transferable at will, ruled both the land and water, air
and fire--the latter being exemplified by the light of the Jewel Stone,
and further by the flint and iron which lay outside the mummy wrappings.

"As we lifted the casket from the sarcophagus, we noticed on its sides
the strange protuberances which you have already seen; but we were
unable at the time to account for them.  There were a few amulets in
the sarcophagus, but none of any special worth or significance.  We
took it that if there were such, they were within the wrappings; or
more probably in the strange casket underneath the mummy's feet.  This,
however, we could not open.  There were signs of there being a cover;
certainly the upper portion and the lower were each in one piece.  The
fine line, a little way from the top, appeared to be where the cover
was fixed; but it was made with such exquisite fineness and finish that
the joining could hardly be seen. Certainly the top could not be moved.
We took it, that it was in some way fastened from within.  I tell you
all this in order that you may understand things with which you may be
in contact later.  You must suspend your judgment entirely.  Such
strange things have happened regarding this mummy and all around it,
that there is a necessity for new belief somewhere.  It is absolutely
impossible to reconcile certain things which have happened with the
ordinary currents of life or knowledge.

"We stayed around the Valley of the Sorcerer, till we had copied
roughly all the drawings and writings on the walls, ceiling and floor.
We took with us the Stele of lapis lazuli, whose graven record was
coloured with vermilion pigment.  We took the sarcophagus and the
mummy; the stone chest with the alabaster jars; the tables of
bloodstone and alabaster and onyx and carnelian; and the ivory pillow
whose arch rested on 'buckles', round each of which was twisted an
uraeus wrought in gold. We took all the articles which lay in the
Chapel, and the Mummy Pit; the wooden boats with crews and the ushaptiu
figures, and the symbolic amulets.

"When coming away we took down the ladders, and at a distance buried
them in the sand under a cliff, which we noted so that if necessary we
might find them again. Then with our heavy baggage, we set out on our
laborious journey back to the Nile. It was no easy task, I tell you, to
bring the case with that great sarcophagus over the desert.  We had a
rough cart and sufficient men to draw it; but the progress seemed
terribly slow, for we were anxious to get our treasures into a place of
safety.  The night was an anxious time with us, for we feared attack
from some marauding band. But more still we feared some of those with
us.  They were, after all, but predatory, unscrupulous men; and we had
with us a considerable bulk of precious things. They, or at least the
dangerous ones amongst them, did not know why it was so precious; they
took it for granted that it was material treasure of some kind that we
carried.  We had taken the mummy from the sarcophagus, and packed it
for safety of travel in a separate case.  During the first night two
attempts were made to steal things from the cart; and two men were
found dead in the morning.

"On the second night there came on a violent storm, one of those
terrible simooms of the desert which makes one feel his helplessness.
We were overwhelmed with drifting sand.  Some of our Bedouins had fled
before the storm, hoping to find shelter; the rest of us, wrapped in
our bournous, endured with what patience we could.  In the morning,
when the storm had passed, we recovered from under the piles of sand
what we could of our impedimenta.  We found the case in which the mummy
had been packed all broken, but the mummy itself could nowhere be
found. We searched everywhere around, and dug up the sand which had
piled around us; but in vain.  We did not know what to do, for Trelawny
had his heart set on taking home that mummy.  We waited a whole day in
hopes that the Bedouins, who had fled, would return; we had a blind
hope that they might have in some way removed the mummy from the cart,
and would restore it.  That night, just before dawn, Mr. Trelawny woke
me up and whispered in my ear:

"'We must go back to the tomb in the Valley of the Sorcerer.  Show no
hesitation in the morning when I give the orders!  If you ask any
questions as to where we are going it will create suspicion, and will
defeat our purpose."

"'All right!" I answered.  "But why shall we go there?'  His answer
seemed to thrill through me as though it had struck some chord ready
tuned within:

"'We shall find the mummy there!  I am sure of it!'  Then anticipating
doubt or argument he added:

"'Wait, and you shall see!' and he sank back into his blanket again.

"The Arabs were surprised when we retraced our steps; and some of them
were not satisfied.  There was a good deal of friction, and there were
several desertions; so that it was with a diminished following that we
took our way eastward again.  At first the Sheik did not manifest any
curiosity as to our definite destination; but when it became apparent
that we were again making for the Valley of the Sorcerer, he too showed
concern.  This grew as we drew near; till finally at the entrance of
the valley he halted and refused to go further.  He said he would await
our return if we chose to go on alone.  That he would wait three days;
but if by that time we had not returned he would leave.  No offer of
money would tempt him to depart from this resolution.  The only
concession he would make was that he would find the ladders and bring
them near the cliff.  This he did; and then, with the rest of the
troop, he went back to wait at the entrance of the valley.

"Mr. Trelawny and I took ropes and torches, and again ascended to the
tomb.  It was evident that someone had been there in our absence, for
the stone slab which protected the entrance to the tomb was lying flat
inside, and a rope was dangling from the cliff summit.  Within, there
was another rope hanging into the shaft of the Mummy Pit.  We looked at
each other; but neither said a word.  We fixed our own rope, and as
arranged Trelawny descended first, I following at once.  It was not
till we stood together at the foot of the shaft that the thought
flashed across me that we might be in some sort of a trap; that someone
might descend the rope from the cliff, and by cutting the rope by which
we had lowered ourselves into the Pit, bury us there alive.  The
thought was horrifying; but it was too late to do anything.  I remained
silent.  We both had torches, so that there was ample light as we
passed through the passage and entered the Chamber where the
sarcophagus had stood. The first thing noticeable was the emptiness of
the place.  Despite all its magnificent adornment, the tomb was made a
desolation by the absence of the great sarcophagus, to hold which it
was hewn in the rock; of the chest with the alabaster jars; of the
tables which had held the implements and food for the use of the dead,
and the ushaptiu figures.

"It was made more infinitely desolate still by the shrouded figure of
the mummy of Queen Tera which lay on the floor where the great
sarcophagus had stood!  Beside it lay, in the strange contorted
attitudes of violent death, three of the Arabs who had deserted from
our party.  Their faces were black, and their hands and necks were
smeared with blood which had burst from mouth and nose and eyes.

"On the throat of each were the marks, now blackening, of a hand of
seven fingers.

"Trelawny and I drew close, and clutched each other in awe and fear as
we looked.

"For, most wonderful of all, across the breast of the mummied Queen lay
a hand of seven fingers, ivory white, the wrist only showing a scar
like a jagged red line, from which seemed to depend drops of blood."




Chapter XII

The Magic Coffer


"When we recovered our amazement, which seemed to last unduly long, we
did not lose any time carrying the mummy through the passage, and
hoisting it up the Pit shaft.  I went first, to receive it at the top.
As I looked down, I saw Mr. Trelawny lift the severed hand and put it
in his breast, manifestly to save it from being injured or lost.  We
left the dead Arabs where they lay.  With our ropes we lowered our
precious burden to the ground; and then took it to the entrance of the
valley where our escort was to wait.  To our astonishment we found them
on the move.  When we remonstrated with the Sheik, he answered that he
had fulfilled his contract to the letter; he had waited the three days
as arranged.  I thought that he was lying to cover up his base
intention of deserting us; and I found when we compared notes that
Trelawny had the same suspicion.  It was not till we arrived at Cairo
that we found he was correct.  It was the 3rd of November 1884 when we
entered the Mummy Pit for the second time; we had reason to remember
the date.

"We had lost three whole days of our reckoning--out of our
lives--whilst we had stood wondering in that chamber of the dead.  Was
it strange, then, that we had a superstitious feeling with regard to
the dead Queen Tera and all belonging to her?  Is it any wonder that it
rests with us now, with a bewildering sense of some power outside
ourselves or our comprehension?  Will it be any wonder if it go down to
the grave with us at the appointed time?  If, indeed, there be any
graves for us who have robbed the dead!"  He was silent for quite a
minute before he went on:

"We got to Cairo all right, and from there to Alexandria, where we were
to take ship by the Messagerie service to Marseilles, and go thence by
express to London.  But

     'The best-laid schemes o' mice and men Gang aft agley.'

At Alexandria, Trelawny found waiting a cable stating that Mrs.
Trelawny had died in giving birth to a daughter.

"Her stricken husband hurried off at once by the Orient Express; and I
had to bring the treasure alone to the desolate house.  I got to London
all safe; there seemed to be some special good fortune to our journey.
When I got to this house, the funeral had long been over.  The child
had been put out to nurse, and Mr. Trelawny had so far recovered from
the shock of his loss that he had set himself to take up again the
broken threads of his life and his work.  That he had had a shock, and
a bad one, was apparent.  The sudden grey in his black hair was proof
enough in itself; but in addition, the strong cast of his features had
become set and stern.  Since he received that cable in the shipping
office at Alexandria I have never seen a happy smile on his face.

"Work is the best thing in such a case; and to his work he devoted
himself heart and soul.  The strange tragedy of his loss and gain--for
the child was born after the mother's death--took place during the time
that we stood in that trance in the Mummy Pit of Queen Tera.  It seemed
to have become in some way associated with his Egyptian studies, and
more especially with the mysteries connected with the Queen.  He told
me very little about his daughter; but that two forces struggled in his
mind regarding her was apparent.  I could see that he loved, almost
idolised her. Yet he could never forget that her birth had cost her
mother's life.  Also, there was something whose existence seemed to
wring his father's heart, though he would never tell me what it was.
Again, he once said in a moment of relaxation of his purpose of silence:

"'She is unlike her mother; but in both feature and colour she has a
marvellous resemblance to the pictures of Queen Tera.'

"He said that he had sent her away to people who would care for her as
he could not; and that till she became a woman she should have all the
simple pleasures that a young girl might have, and that were best for
her.  I would often have talked with him about her; but he would never
say much.  Once he said to me:  'There are reasons why I should not
speak more than is necessary.  Some day you will know--and understand!'
I respected his reticence; and beyond asking after her on my return
after a journey, I have never spoken of her again.  I had never seen
her till I did so in your presence.

"Well, when the treasures which we had--ah!--taken from the tomb had
been brought here, Mr. Trelawny arranged their disposition himself.
The mummy, all except the severed hand, he placed in the great
ironstone sarcophagus in the hall.  This was wrought for the Theban
High Priest Uni, and is, as you may have remarked, all inscribed with
wonderful invocations to the old Gods of Egypt.  The rest of the things
from the tomb he disposed about his own room, as you have seen.
Amongst them he placed, for special reasons of his own, the mummy hand.
I think he regards this as the most sacred of his possessions, with
perhaps one exception.  That is the carven ruby which he calls the
'Jewel of Seven Stars', which he keeps in that great safe which is
locked and guarded by various devices, as you know.

"I dare say you find this tedious; but I have had to explain it, so
that you should understand all up to the present.  It was a long time
after my return with the mummy of Queen Tera when Mr. Trelawny
re-opened the subject with me.  He had been several times to Egypt,
sometimes with me and sometimes alone; and I had been several trips, on
my own account or for him.  But in all that time, nearly sixteen years,
he never mentioned the subject, unless when some pressing occasion
suggested, if it did not necessitate, a reference.

"One morning early he sent for me in a hurry; I was then studying in
the British Museum, and had rooms in Hart Street.  When I came, he was
all on fire with excitement.  I had not seen him in such a glow since
before the news of his wife's death.  He took me at once into his room.
The window blinds were down and the shutters closed; not a ray of
daylight came in.  The ordinary lights in the room were not lit, but
there were a lot of powerful electric lamps, fifty candle-power at
least, arranged on one side of the room.  The little bloodstone table
on which the heptagonal coffer stands was drawn to the centre of the
room.  The coffer looked exquisite in the glare of light which shone on
it.  It actually seemed to glow as if lit in some way from within.

"'What do you think of it?' he asked.

"'It is like a jewel,' I answered.  'You may well call it the
'sorcerer's Magic Coffer', if it often looks like that.  It almost
seems to be alive.'

"'Do you know why it seems so?'

"'From the glare of the light, I suppose?'

"'Light of course,' he answered, 'but it is rather the disposition of
light.'  As he spoke he turned up the ordinary lights of the room and
switched off the special ones.  The effect on the stone box was
surprising; in a second it lost all its glowing effect.  It was still a
very beautiful stone, as always; but it was stone and no more.

"'Do you notice anything about the arrangement of the lamps?' he asked.

"'No!'

"'They were in the shape of the stars in the Plough, as the stars are
in the ruby!'  The statement came to me with a certain sense of
conviction. I do not know why, except that there had been so many
mysterious associations with the mummy and all belonging to it that any
new one seemed enlightening.  I listened as Trelawny went on to explain:

"'For sixteen years I have never ceased to think of that adventure, or
to try to find a clue to the mysteries which came before us; but never
until last night did I seem to find a solution.  I think I must have
dreamed of it, for I woke all on fire about it.  I jumped out of bed
with a determination of doing something, before I quite knew what it
was that I wished to do.  Then, all at once, the purpose was clear
before me. There were allusions in the writing on the walls of the tomb
to the seven stars of the Great Bear that go to make up the Plough; and
the North was again and again emphasized.  The same symbols were
repeated with regard to the "Magic Box", as we called it.  We had
already noticed those peculiar translucent spaces in the stone of the
box.  You remember the hieroglyphic writing had told that the jewel
came from the heart of an aerolite, and that the coffer was cut from it
also.  It might be, I thought, that the light of the seven stars,
shining in the right direction, might have some effect on the box, or
something within it.  I raised the blind and looked out. The Plough was
high in the heavens, and both its stars and the Pole Star were straight
opposite the window.  I pulled the table with the coffer out into the
light, and shifted it until the translucent patches were in the
direction of the stars. Instantly the box began to glow, as you saw it
under the lamps, though but slightly. I waited and waited; but the sky
clouded over, and the light died away.  So I got wires and lamps--you
know how often I use them in experiments--and tried the effect of
electric light.  It took me some time to get the lamps properly placed,
so that they would correspond to the parts of the stone, but the moment
I got them right the whole thing began to glow as you have seen it.

"'I could get no further, however.  There was evidently something
wanting.  All at once it came to me that if light could have some
effect there should be in the tomb some means of producing light, for
there could not be starlight in the Mummy Pit in the cavern.  Then the
whole thing seemed to become clear.  On the bloodstone table, which has
a hollow carved in its top, into which the bottom of the coffer fits, I
laid the Magic Coffer; and I at once saw that the odd protuberances so
carefully wrought in the substance of the stone corresponded in a way
to the stars in the constellation.  These, then, were to hold lights.

"'Eureka!' I cried.  'All we want now is the lamps.'"  I tried placing
the electric lights on, or close to, the protuberances.  But the glow
never came to the stone. So the conviction grew on me that there were
special lamps made for the purpose. If we could find them, a step on
the road to solving the mystery should be gained.

"'But what about the lamps?' I asked.  'Where are they?  When are we to
discover them?  How are we to know them if we do find them?  What--"

"He stopped me at once:

"'One thing at a time!' he said quietly.  'Your first question contains
all the rest. Where are these lamps?  I shall tell you:  In the tomb!'

"'In the tomb!' I repeated in surprise.  'Why you and I searched the
place ourselves from end to end; and there was not a sign of a lamp.
Not a sign of anything remaining when we came away the first time; or
on the second, except the bodies of the Arabs.'

"Whilst I was speaking, he had uncoiled some large sheets of paper
which he had brought in his hand from his own room.  These he spread
out on the great table, keeping their edges down with books and
weights.  I knew them at a glance; they were the careful copies which
he had made of our first transcripts from the writing in the tomb.
When he had all ready, he turned to me and said slowly:

"'Do you remember wondering, when we examined the tomb, at the lack of
one thing which is usually found in such a tomb?'

"'Yes!  There was no serdab.'

"The serdab, I may perhaps explain," said Mr. Corbeck to me, "is a sort
of niche built or hewn in the wall of a tomb.  Those which have as yet
been examined bear no inscriptions, and contain only effigies of the
dead for whom the tomb was made." Then he went on with his narrative:

"Trelawny, when he saw that I had caught his meaning, went on speaking
with something of his old enthusiasm:

"'I have come to the conclusion that there must be a serdab--a secret
one.  We were dull not to have thought of it before.  We might have
known that the maker of such a tomb--a woman, who had shown in other
ways such a sense of beauty and completeness, and who had finished
every detail with a feminine richness of elaboration--would not have
neglected such an architectural feature.  Even if it had not its own
special significance in ritual, she would have had it as an adornment.
Others had had it, and she liked her own work to be complete.  Depend
upon it, there was--there is--a serdab; and that in it, when it is
discovered, we shall find the lamps.  Of course, had we known then what
we now know or at all events surmise, that there were lamps, we might
have suspected some hidden spot, some cachet.  I am going to ask you to
go out to Egypt again; to seek the tomb; to find the serdab; and to
bring back the lamps!'"

"'And if I find there is no serdab; or if discovering it I find no
lamps in it, what then?' He smiled grimly with that saturnine smile of
his, so rarely seen for years past, as he spoke slowly:

"'Then you will have to hustle till you find them!'

"'Good!' I said.  He pointed to one of the sheets.

"'Here are the transcripts from the Chapel at the south and the east.
I have been looking over the writings again; and I find that in seven
places round this corner are the symbols of the constellation which we
call the Plough, which Queen Tera held to rule her birth and her
destiny.  I have examined them carefully, and I notice that they are
all representations of the grouping of the stars, as the constellation
appears in different parts of the heavens.  They are all astronomically
correct; and as in the real sky the Pointers indicate the Pole Star, so
these all point to one spot in the wall where usually the serdab is to
be found!'

"'Bravo!' I shouted, for such a piece of reasoning demanded applause.
He seemed pleased as he went on:

"'When you are in the tomb, examine this spot.  There is probably some
spring or mechanical contrivance for opening the receptacle.  What it
may be, there is no use guessing.  You will know what best to do, when
you are on the spot.'

"I started the next week for Egypt; and never rested till I stood again
in the tomb.  I had found some of our old following; and was fairly
well provided with help.  The country was now in a condition very
different to that in which it had been sixteen years before; there was
no need for troops or armed men.

"I climbed the rock face alone.  There was no difficulty, for in that
fine climate the woodwork of the ladder was still dependable.  It was
easy to see that in the years that had elapsed there had been other
visitors to the tomb; and my heart sank within me when I thought that
some of them might by chance have come across the secret place.  It
would be a bitter discovery indeed to find that they had forestalled
me; and that my journey had been in vain.

"The bitterness was realised when I lit my torches, and passed between
the seven-sided columns to the Chapel of the tomb.

"There, in the very spot where I had expected to find it, was the
opening of a serdab. And the serdab was empty.

"But the Chapel was not empty; for the dried-up body of a man in Arab
dress lay close under the opening, as though he had been stricken down.
I examined all round the walls to see if Trelawny's surmise was
correct; and I found that in all the positions of the stars as given,
the Pointers of the Plough indicated a spot to the left hand, or south
side, of the opening of the serdab, where was a single star in gold.

"I pressed this, and it gave way.  The stone which had marked the front
of the serdab, and which lay back against the wall within, moved
slightly.  On further examining the other side of the opening, I found
a similar spot, indicated by other representations of the
constellation; but this was itself a figure of the seven stars, and
each was wrought in burnished gold.  I pressed each star in turn; but
without result.  Then it struck me that if the opening spring was on
the left, this on the right might have been intended for the
simultaneous pressure of all the stars by one hand of seven fingers.
By using both my hands, I managed to effect this.

"With a loud click, a metal figure seemed to dart from close to the
opening of the serdab; the stone slowly swung back to its place, and
shut with a click.  The glimpse which I had of the descending figure
appalled me for the moment.  It was like that grim guardian which,
according to the Arabian historian Ibn Abd Alhokin, the builder of the
Pyramids, King Saurid Ibn Salhouk placed in the Western Pyramid to
defend its treasure:  'A marble figure, upright, with lance in hand;
with on his head a serpent wreathed.  When any approached, the serpent
would bite him on one side, and twining about his throat and killing
him, would return again to his place.'

"I knew well that such a figure was not wrought to pleasantry; and that
to brave it was no child's play.  The dead Arab at my feet was proof of
what could be done!  So I examined again along the wall; and found here
and there chippings as if someone had been tapping with a heavy hammer.
This then had been what happened:  The grave-robber, more expert at his
work than we had been, and suspecting the presence of a hidden serdab,
had made essay to find it.  He had struck the spring by chance; had
released the avenging 'Treasurer', as the Arabian writer designated
him. The issue spoke for itself.  I got a piece of wood, and, standing
at a safe distance, pressed with the end of it upon the star.

"Instantly the stone flew back.  The hidden figure within darted
forward and thrust out its lance.  Then it rose up and disappeared.  I
thought I might now safely press on the seven stars; and did so.  Again
the stone rolled back; and the 'Treasurer' flashed by to his hidden
lair.

"I repeated both experiments several times; with always the same
result. I should have liked to examine the mechanism of that figure of
such malignant mobility; but it was not possible without such tools as
could not easily be had.  It might be necessary to cut into a whole
section of the rock.  Some day I hope to go back, properly equipped,
and attempt it.

"Perhaps you do not know that the entrance to a serdab is almost always
very narrow; sometimes a hand can hardly be inserted.  Two things I
learned from this serdab.  The first was that the lamps, if lamps at
all there had been, could not have been of large size; and secondly,
that they would be in some way associated with Hathor, whose symbol,
the hawk in a square with the right top corner forming a smaller
square, was cut in relief on the wall within, and coloured the bright
vermilion which we had found on the Stele.  Hathor is the goddess who
in Egyptian mythology answers to Venus of the Greeks, in as far as she
is the presiding deity of beauty and pleasure.  In the Egyptian
mythology, however, each God has many forms; and in some aspects Hathor
has to do with the idea of resurrection.  There are seven forms or
variants of the Goddess; why should not these correspond in some way to
the seven lamps!  That there had been such lamps, I was convinced.  The
first grave-robber had met his death; the second had found the contents
of the serdab.  The first attempt had been made years since; the state
of the body proved this.  I had no clue to the second attempt.  It
might have been long ago; or it might have been recently.  If, however,
others had been to the tomb, it was probable that the lamps had been
taken long ago.  Well! all the more difficult would be my search; for
undertaken it must be!

"That was nearly three years ago; and for all that time I have been
like the man in the Arabian Nights, seeking old lamps, not for new, but
for cash.  I dared not say what I was looking for, or attempt to give
any description; for such would have defeated my purpose.  But I had in
my own mind at the start a vague idea of what I must find.  In process
of time this grew more and more clear; till at last I almost overshot
my mark by searching for something which might have been wrong.

"The disappointments I suffered, and the wild-goose chases I made,
would fill a volume; but I persevered.  At last, not two months ago, I
was shown by an old dealer in Mossul one lamp such as I had looked for.
I had been tracing it for nearly a year, always suffering
disappointment, but always buoyed up to further endeavour by a growing
hope that I was on the track.

"I do not know how I restrained myself when I realised that, at last, I
was at least close to success.  I was skilled, however, in the finesse
of Eastern trade; and the Jew-Arab-Portugee trader met his match.  I
wanted to see all his stock before buying; and one by one he produced,
amongst masses of rubbish, seven different lamps.  Each of them had a
distinguishing mark; and each and all was some form of the symbol of
Hathor.  I think I shook the imperturbability of my swarthy friend by
the magnitude of my purchases; for in order to prevent him guessing
what form of goods I sought, I nearly cleared out his shop.  At the end
he nearly wept, and said I had ruined him; for now he had nothing to
sell. He would have torn his hair had he known what price I should
ultimately have given for some of his stock, that perhaps he valued
least.

"I parted with most of my merchandise at normal price as I hurried
home. I did not dare to give it away, or even lose it, lest I should
incur suspicion.  My burden was far too precious to be risked by any
foolishness now.  I got on as fast as it is possible to travel in such
countries; and arrived in London with only the lamps and certain
portable curios and papyri which I had picked up on my travels.

"Now, Mr. Ross, you know all I know; and I leave it to your discretion
how much, if any of it, you will tell Miss Trelawny."

As he finished a clear young voice said behind us:

"What about Miss Trelawny?  She is here!"

We turned, startled; and looked at each other inquiringly.  Miss
Trelawny stood in the doorway.  We did not know how long she had been
present, or how much she had heard.




Chapter XIII

Awaking From the Trance


The first unexpected words may always startle a hearer; but when the
shock is over, the listener's reason has asserted itself, and he can
judge of the manner, as well as of the matter, of speech.  Thus it was
on this occasion.  With intelligence now alert, I could not doubt of
the simple sincerity of Margaret's next question.

"What have you two men been talking about all this time, Mr. Ross?  I
suppose, Mr. Corbeck has been telling you all his adventures in finding
the lamps.  I hope you will tell me too, some day, Mr. Corbeck; but
that must not be till my poor Father is better.  He would like, I am
sure, to tell me all about these things himself; or to be present when
I heard them."  She glanced sharply from one to the other.  "Oh, that
was what you were saying as I came in?  All right!  I shall wait; but I
hope it won't be long.  The continuance of Father's condition is, I
feel, breaking me down.  A little while ago I felt that my nerves were
giving out; so I determined to go out for a walk in the Park.  I am
sure it will do me good.  I want you, if you will, Mr. Ross, to be with
Father whilst I am away.  I shall feel secure then."

I rose with alacrity, rejoicing that the poor girl was going out, even
for half an hour. She was looking terribly wearied and haggard; and the
sight of her pale cheeks made my heart ache.  I went to the sick-room;
and sat down in my usual place.  Mrs. Grant was then on duty; we had
not found it necessary to have more than one person in the room during
the day.  When I came in, she took occasion to go about some household
duty. The blinds were up, but the north aspect of the room softened the
hot glare of the sunlight without.

I sat for a long time thinking over all that Mr. Corbeck had told me;
and weaving its wonders into the tissue of strange things which had
come to pass since I had entered the house.  At times I was inclined to
doubt; to doubt everything and every one; to doubt even the evidences
of my own five senses.  The warnings of the skilled detective kept
coming back to my mind.  He had put down Mr. Corbeck as a clever liar,
and a confederate of Miss Trelawny.  Of Margaret!  That settled it!
Face to face with such a proposition as that, doubt vanished.  Each
time when her image, her name, the merest thought of her, came before
my mind, each event stood out stark as a living fact.  My life upon her
faith!

I was recalled from my reverie, which was fast becoming a dream of
love, in a startling manner.  A voice came from the bed; a deep,
strong, masterful voice.  The first note of it called up like a clarion
my eyes and my ears.  The sick man was awake and speaking!

"Who are you?  What are you doing here?"

Whatever ideas any of us had ever formed of his waking, I am quite sure
that none of us expected to see him start up all awake and full master
of himself.  I was so surprised that I answered almost mechanically:

"Ross is my name.  I have been watching by you!"  He looked surprised
for an instant, and then I could see that his habit of judging for
himself came into play.

"Watching by me!  How do you mean?  Why watching by me?"  His eye had
now lit on his heavily bandaged wrist.  He went on in a different tone;
less aggressive, more genial, as of one accepting facts:

"Are you a doctor?"  I felt myself almost smiling as I answered; the
relief from the long pressure of anxiety regarding his life was
beginning to tell:

"No, sir!"

"Then why are you here?  If you are not a doctor, what are you?"  His
tone was again more dictatorial.  Thought is quick; the whole train of
reasoning on which my answer must be based flooded through my brain
before the words could leave my lips. Margaret!  I must think of
Margaret!  This was her father, who as yet knew nothing of me; even of
my very existence.  He would be naturally curious, if not anxious, to
know why I amongst men had been chosen as his daughter's friend on the
occasion of his illness.  Fathers are naturally a little jealous in
such matters as a daughter's choice, and in the undeclared state of my
love for Margaret I must do nothing which could ultimately embarrass
her.

"I am a Barrister.  It is not, however, in that capacity I am here; but
simply as a friend of your daughter.  It was probably her knowledge of
my being a lawyer which first determined her to ask me to come when she
thought you had been murdered. Afterwards she was good enough to
consider me to be a friend, and to allow me to remain in accordance
with your expressed wish that someone should remain to watch."

Mr. Trelawny was manifestly a man of quick thought, and of few words.
He gazed at me keenly as I spoke, and his piercing eyes seemed to read
my thought.  To my relief he said no more on the subject just then,
seeming to accept my words in simple faith. There was evidently in his
own mind some cause for the acceptance deeper than my own knowledge.
His eyes flashed, and there was an unconscious movement of the
mouth--it could hardly be called a twitch--which betokened
satisfaction.  He was following out some train of reasoning in his own
mind.  Suddenly he said:

"She thought I had been murdered!  Was that last night?"

"No! four days ago."  He seemed surprised.  Whilst he had been speaking
the first time he had sat up in bed; now he made a movement as though
he would jump out. With an effort, however, he restrained himself;
leaning back on his pillows he said quietly:

"Tell me all about it!  All you know!  Every detail!  Omit nothing!
But stay; first lock the door!  I want to know, before I see anyone,
exactly how things stand."

Somehow his last words made my heart leap.  "Anyone!"  He evidently
accepted me, then, as an exception.  In my present state of feeling for
his daughter, this was a comforting thought.  I felt exultant as I went
over to the door and softly turned the key.  When I came back I found
him sitting up again.  He said:

"Go on!"

Accordingly, I told him every detail, even of the slightest which I
could remember, of what had happened from the moment of my arrival at
the house.  Of course I said nothing of my feeling towards Margaret,
and spoke only concerning those things already within his own
knowledge. With regard to Corbeck, I simply said that he had brought
back some lamps of which he had been in quest.  Then I proceeded to
tell him fully of their loss, and of their re-discovery in the house.

He listened with a self-control which, under the circumstances, was to
me little less than marvellous.  It was impassiveness, for at times his
eyes would flash or blaze, and the strong fingers of his uninjured hand
would grip the sheet, pulling it into far-extending wrinkles.  This was
most noticeable when I told him of the return of Corbeck, and the
finding of the lamps in the boudoir.  At times he spoke, but only a few
words, and as if unconsciously in emotional comment.  The mysterious
parts, those which had most puzzled us, seemed to have no special
interest for him; he seemed to know them already.  The utmost concern
he showed was when I told him of Daw's shooting.  His muttered comment:
"stupid ass!" together with a quick glance across the room at the
injured cabinet, marked the measure of his disgust.  As I told him of
his daughter's harrowing anxiety for him, of her unending care and
devotion, of the tender love which she had shown, he seemed much moved.
There was a sort of veiled surprise in his unconscious whisper:

"Margaret!  Margaret!"

When I had finished my narration, bringing matters up to the moment
when Miss Trelawny had gone out for her walk--I thought of her as "Miss
Trelawny', not as 'Margaret' now, in the presence of her father--he
remained silent for quite a long time.  It was probably two or three
minutes; but it seemed interminable.  All at once he turned and said to
me briskly:

"Now tell me all about yourself!"  This was something of a floorer; I
felt myself grow red-hot.  Mr. Trelawny's eyes were upon me; they were
now calm and inquiring, but never ceasing in their soul-searching
scrutiny.  There was just a suspicion of a smile on the mouth which,
though it added to my embarrassment, gave me a certain measure of
relief.  I was, however, face to face with difficulty; and the habit of
my life stood me in good stead.  I looked him straight in the eyes as I
spoke:

"My name, as I told you, is Ross, Malcolm Ross.  I am by profession a
Barrister.  I was made a Q. C. in the last year of the Queen's reign.
I have been fairly successful in my work."  To my relief he said:

"Yes, I know.  I have always heard well of you!  Where and when did you
meet Margaret?"

"First at the Hay's in Belgrave Square, ten days ago.  Then at a picnic
up the river with Lady Strathconnell.  We went from Windsor to Cookham.
Mar--Miss Trelawny was in my boat.  I scull a little, and I had my own
boat at Windsor.  We had a good deal of conversation--naturally."

"Naturally!" there was just a suspicion of something sardonic in the
tone of acquiescence; but there was no other intimation of his feeling.
I began to think that as I was in the presence of a strong man, I
should show something of my own strength.  My friends, and sometimes my
opponents, say that I am a strong man.  In my present circumstances,
not to be absolutely truthful would be to be weak.  So I stood up to
the difficulty before me; always bearing in mind, however, that my
words might affect Margaret's happiness through her love for her
father.  I went on:

"In conversation at a place and time and amid surroundings so pleasing,
and in a solitude inviting to confidence, I got a glimpse of her inner
life.  Such a glimpse as a man of my years and experience may get from
a young girl!"  The father's face grew graver as I went on; but he said
nothing.  I was committed now to a definite line of speech, and went on
with such mastery of my mind as I could exercise.  The occasion might
be fraught with serious consequences to me too.

"I could not but see that there was over her spirit a sense of
loneliness which was habitual to her.  I thought I understood it; I am
myself an only child.  I ventured to encourage her to speak to me
freely; and was happy enough to succeed.  A sort of confidence became
established between us."  There was something in the father's face
which made me add hurriedly:

"Nothing was said by her, sir, as you can well imagine, which was not
right and proper.  She only told me in the impulsive way of one longing
to give voice to thoughts long carefully concealed, of her yearning to
be closer to the father whom she loved; more en rapport with him; more
in his confidence; closer within the circle of his sympathies.  Oh,
believe me, sir, that it was all good!  All that a father's heart could
hope or wish for!  It was all loyal!  That she spoke it to me was
perhaps because I was almost a stranger with whom there was no previous
barrier to confidence."

Here I paused.  It was hard to go on; and I feared lest I might, in my
zeal, do Margaret a disservice.  The relief of the strain came from her
father.

"And you?"

"Sir, Miss Trelawny is very sweet and beautiful!  She is young; and her
mind is like crystal!  Her sympathy is a joy!  I am not an old man, and
my affections were not engaged.  They never had been till then.  I hope
I may say as much, even to a father!" My eyes involuntarily dropped.
When I raised them again Mr. Trelawny was still gazing at me keenly.
All the kindliness of his nature seemed to wreath itself in a smile as
he held out his hand and said:

"Malcolm Ross, I have always heard of you as a fearless and honourable
gentleman. I am glad my girl has such a friend!  Go on!"

My heart leaped.  The first step to the winning of Margaret's father
was gained.  I dare say I was somewhat more effusive in my words and my
manner as I went on.  I certainly felt that way.

"One thing we gain as we grow older:  to use our age judiciously!  I
have had much experience.  I have fought for it and worked for it all
my life; and I felt that I was justified in using it.  I ventured to
ask Miss Trelawny to count on me as a friend; to let me serve her
should occasion arise.  She promised me that she would.  I had little
idea that my chance of serving her should come so soon or in such a
way; but that very night you were stricken down.  In her desolation and
anxiety she sent for me!" I paused.  He continued to look at me as I
went on:

"When your letter of instructions was found, I offered my services.
They were accepted, as you know."

"And these days, how did they pass for you?"  The question startled me.
There was in it something of Margaret's own voice and manner; something
so greatly resembling her lighter moments that it brought out all the
masculinity in me.  I felt more sure of my ground now as I said:

"These days, sir, despite all their harrowing anxiety, despite all the
pain they held for the girl whom I grew to love more and more with each
passing hour, have been the happiest of my life!"  He kept silence for
a long time; so long that, as I waited for him to speak, with my heart
beating, I began to wonder if my frankness had been too effusive.  At
last he said:

"I suppose it is hard to say so much vicariously.  Her poor mother
should have heard you; it would have made her heart glad!"  Then a
shadow swept across his face; and he went on more hurriedly.

"But are you quite sure of all this?"

"I know my own heart, sir; or, at least, I think I do!"

"No! no!" he answered, "I don't mean you.  That is all right!  But you
spoke of my girl's affection for me ... and yet...!  And yet she has
been living here, in my house, a whole year... Still, she spoke to you
of her loneliness--her desolation.  I never--it grieves me to say it,
but it is true--I never saw sign of such affection towards myself in
all the year!..."  His voice trembled away into sad, reminiscent
introspection.

"Then, sir," I said, "I have been privileged to see more in a few days
than you in her whole lifetime!"  My words seemed to call him up from
himself; and I thought that it was with pleasure as well as surprise
that he said:

"I had no idea of it.  I thought that she was indifferent to me.  That
what seemed like the neglect of her youth was revenging itself on me.
That she was cold of heart.... It is a joy unspeakable to me that her
mother's daughter loves me too!" Unconsciously he sank back upon his
pillow, lost in memories of the past.

How he must have loved her mother!  It was the love of her mother's
child, rather than the love of his own daughter, that appealed to him.
My heart went out to him in a great wave of sympathy and kindliness.  I
began to understand.  To understand the passion of these two great,
silent, reserved natures, that successfully concealed the burning
hunger for the other's love!  It did not surprise me when presently he
murmured to himself:

"Margaret, my child!  Tender, and thoughtful, and strong, and true, and
brave!  Like her dear mother! like her dear mother!"

And then to the very depths of my heart I rejoiced that I had spoken so
frankly.

Presently Mr. Trelawny said:

"Four days!  The sixteenth!  Then this is the twentieth of July?"  I
nodded affirmation; he went on:

"So I have been lying in a trance for four days.  It is not the first
time.  I was in a trance once under strange conditions for three days;
and never even suspected it till I was told of the lapse of time.  I
shall tell you all about it some day, if you care to hear."

That made me thrill with pleasure.  That he, Margaret's father, would
so take me into his confidence made it possible.... The business-like,
every-day alertness of his voice as he spoke next quite recalled me:

"I had better get up now.  When Margaret comes in, tell her yourself
that I am all right.  It will avoid any shock!  And will you tell
Corbeck that I would like to see him as soon as I can.  I want to see
those lamps, and hear all about them!"

His attitude towards me filled me with delight.  There was a possible
father-in-law aspect that would have raised me from a death-bed.  I was
hurrying away to carry out his wishes; when, however, my hand was on
the key of the door, his voice recalled me:

"Mr. Ross!"

I did not like to hear him say "Mr."  After he knew of my friendship
with his daughter he had called me Malcolm Ross; and this obvious
return to formality not only pained, but filled me with apprehension.
It must be something about Margaret.  I thought of her as "Margaret"
and not as "Miss Trelawny", now that there was danger of losing her. I
know now what I felt then:  that I was determined to fight for her
rather than lose her.  I came back, unconsciously holding myself erect.
Mr. Trelawny, the keen observer of men, seemed to read my thought; his
face, which was set in a new anxiety, relaxed as he said:

"Sit down a minute; it is better that we speak now than later.  We are
both men, and men of the world.  All this about my daughter is very new
to me, and very sudden; and I want to know exactly how and where I
stand.  Mind, I am making no objection; but as a father I have duties
which are grave, and may prove to be painful.  I--I"--he seemed
slightly at a loss how to begin, and this gave me hope--"I suppose I am
to take it, from what you have said to me of your feelings towards my
girl, that it is in your mind to be a suitor for her hand, later on?"
I answered at once:

"Absolutely!  Firm and fixed; it was my intention the evening after I
had been with her on the river, to seek you, of course after a proper
and respectful interval, and to ask you if I might approach her on the
subject.  Events forced me into closer relationship more quickly than I
had to hope would be possible; but that first purpose has remained
fresh in my heart, and has grown in intensity, and multiplied itself
with every hour which has passed since then."  His face seemed to
soften as he looked at me; the memory of his own youth was coming back
to him instinctively.  After a pause he said:

"I suppose I may take it, too, Malcolm Ross"--the return to the
familiarity of address swept through me with a glorious thrill--"that
as yet you have not made any protestation to my daughter?"

"Not in words, sir."  The arriere pensee of my phrase struck me, not by
its own humour, but through the grave, kindly smile on the father's
face.  There was a pleasant sarcasm in his comment:

"Not in words!  That is dangerous!  She might have doubted words, or
even disbelieved them."

I felt myself blushing to the roots of my hair as I went on:

"The duty of delicacy in her defenceless position; my respect for her
father--I did not know you then, sir, as yourself, but only as her
father--restrained me.  But even had not these barriers existed, I
should not have dared in the presence of such grief and anxiety to have
declared myself.  Mr. Trelawny, I assure you on my word of honour that
your daughter and I are as yet, on her part, but friends and nothing
more!"  Once again he held out his hands, and we clasped each other
warmly.  Then he said heartily:

"I am satisfied, Malcolm Ross.  Of course, I take it that until I have
seen her and have given you permission, you will not make any
declaration to my daughter--in words," he added, with an indulgent
smile. But his face became stern again as he went on:

"Time presses; and I have to think of some matters so urgent and so
strange that I dare not lose an hour.  Otherwise I should not have been
prepared to enter, at so short a notice and to so new a friend, on the
subject of my daughter's settlement in life, and of her future
happiness."  There was a dignity and a certain proudness in his manner
which impressed me much.

"I shall respect your wishes, sir!" I said as I went back and opened
the door.  I heard him lock it behind me.

When I told Mr. Corbeck that Mr. Trelawny had quite recovered, he began
to dance about like a wild man.  But he suddenly stopped, and asked me
to be careful not to draw any inferences, at all events at first, when
in the future speaking of the finding of the lamps, or of the first
visits to the tomb.  This was in case Mr. Trelawny should speak to me
on the subject; "as, of course, he will," he added, with a sidelong
look at me which meant knowledge of the affairs of my heart.  I agreed
to this, feeling that it was quite right.  I did not quite understand
why; but I knew that Mr. Trelawny was a peculiar man.  In no case could
one make a mistake by being reticent. Reticence is a quality which a
strong man always respects.

The manner in which the others of the house took the news of the
recovery varied much.  Mrs. Grant wept with emotion; then she hurried
off to see if she could do anything personally, and to set the house in
order for "Master", as she always called him.  The Nurse's face fell:
she was deprived of an interesting case.  But the disappointment was
only momentary; and she rejoiced that the trouble was over. She was
ready to come to the patient the moment she should be wanted; but in
the meantime she occupied herself in packing her portmanteau.

I took Sergeant Daw into the study, so that we should be alone when I
told him the news.  It surprised even his iron self-control when I told
him the method of the waking.  I was myself surprised in turn by his
first words:

"And how did he explain the first attack?  He was unconscious when the
second was made."

Up to that moment the nature of the attack, which was the cause of my
coming to the house, had never even crossed my mind, except when I had
simply narrated the various occurrences in sequence to Mr. Trelawny.
The Detective did not seem to think much of my answer:

"Do you know, it never occurred to me to ask him!"  The professional
instinct was strong in the man, and seemed to supersede everything else.

"That is why so few cases are ever followed out," he said, "unless our
people are in them.  Your amateur detective neer hunts down to the
death.  As for ordinary people, the moment things begin to mend, and
the strain of suspense is off them, they drop the matter in hand.  It
is like sea-sickness," he added philosophically after a pause; "the
moment you touch the shore you never give it a thought, but run off to
the buffet to feed!  Well, Mr. Ross, I'm glad the case is over; for
over it is, so far as I am concerned.  I suppose that Mr. Trelawny
knows his own business; and that now he is well again, he will take it
up himself. Perhaps, however, he will not do anything. As he seemed to
expect something to happen, but did not ask for protection from the
police in any way, I take it that he don't want them to interfere with
an eye to punishment.  We'll be told officially, I suppose, that it was
an accident, or sleep-walking, or something of the kind, to satisfy the
conscience of our Record Department; and that will be the end.  As for
me, I tell you frankly, sir, that it will be the saving of me.  I
verily believe I was beginning to get dotty over it all.  There were
too many mysteries, that aren't in my line, for me to be really
satisfied as to either facts or the causes of them.  Now I'll be able
to wash my hands of it, and get back to clean, wholesome, criminal
work.  Of course, sir, I'll be glad to know if you ever do light on a
cause of any kind.  And I'll be grateful if you can ever tell me how
the man was dragged out of bed when the cat bit him, and who used the
knife the second time.  For master Silvio could never have done it by
himself.  But there! I keep thinking of it still.  I must look out and
keep a check on myself, or I shall think of it when I have to keep my
mind on other things!"

When Margaret returned from her walk, I met her in the hall.  She was
still pale and sad; somehow, I had expected to see her radiant after
her walk.  The moment she saw me her eyes brightened, and she looked at
me keenly.

"You have some good news for me?" she said.  "Is Father better?"

"He is!  Why did you think so?"

"I saw it in your face.  I must go to him at once."  She was hurrying
away when I stopped her.

"He said he would send for you the moment he was dressed."

"He said he would send for me!" she repeated in amazement.  "Then he is
awake again, and conscious?  I had no idea he was so well as that! O
Malcolm!"

She sat down on the nearest chair and began to cry.  I felt overcome
myself.  The sight of her joy and emotion, the mention of my own name
in such a way and at such a time, the rush of glorious possibilities
all coming together, quite unmanned me.  She saw my emotion, and seemed
to understand.  She put out her hand.  I held it hard, and kissed it.
Such moments as these, the opportunities of lovers, are gifts of the
gods! Up to this instant, though I knew I loved her, and though I
believed she returned my affection, I had had only hope.  Now, however,
the self-surrender manifest in her willingness to let me squeeze her
hand, the ardour of her pressure in return, and the glorious flush of
love in her beautiful, deep, dark eyes as she lifted them to mine, were
all the eloquences which the most impatient or exacting lover could
expect or demand.

No word was spoken; none was needed.  Even had I not been pledged to
verbal silence, words would have been poor and dull to express what we
felt.  Hand in hand, like two little children, we went up the staircase
and waited on the landing, till the summons from Mr. Trelawny should
come.

I whispered in her ear--it was nicer than speaking aloud and at a
greater distance--how her father had awakened, and what he had said;
and all that had passed between us, except when she herself had been
the subject of conversation.

Presently a bell rang from the room.  Margaret slipped from me, and
looked back with warning finger on lip.  She went over to her father's
door and knocked softly.

"Come in!" said the strong voice.

"It is I, Father!"  The voice was tremulous with love and hope.

There was a quick step inside the room; the door was hurriedly thrown
open, and in an instant Margaret, who had sprung forward, was clasped
in her father's arms. There was little speech; only a few broken
phrases.

"Father!  Dear, dear Father!"

"My child!  Margaret!  My dear, dear child!"

"O Father, Father!  At last!  At last!"

Here the father and daughter went into the room together, and the door
closed.




Chapter XIV

The Birth-Mark


During my waiting for the summons to Mr. Trelawny's room, which I knew
would come, the time was long and lonely.  After the first few moments
of emotional happiness at Margaret's joy, I somehow felt apart and
alone; and for a little time the selfishness of a lover possessed me.
But it was not for long.  Margaret's happiness was all to me; and in
the conscious sense of it I lost my baser self.  Margaret's last words
as the door closed on them gave the key to the whole situation, as it
had been and as it was.  These two proud, strong people, though father
and daughter, had only come to know each other when the girl was grown
up. Margaret's nature was of that kind which matures early.

The pride and strength of each, and the reticence which was their
corollary, made a barrier at the beginning.  Each had respected the
other's reticence too much thereafter; and the misunderstanding grew to
habit.  And so these two loving hearts, each of which yearned for
sympathy from the other, were kept apart.  But now all was well, and in
my heart of hearts I rejoiced that at last Margaret was happy.  Whilst
I was still musing on the subject, and dreaming dreams of a personal
nature, the door was opened, and Mr. Trelawny beckoned to me.

"Come in, Mr. Ross!" he said cordially, but with a certain formality
which I dreaded.  I entered the room, and he closed the door again.  He
held out his hand, and I put mine in it.  He did not let it go, but
still held it as he drew me over toward his daughter.  Margaret looked
from me to him, and back again; and her eyes fell.  When I was close to
her, Mr. Trelawny let go my hand, and, looking his daughter straight in
the face, said:

"If things are as I fancy, we shall not have any secrets between us.
Malcolm Ross knows so much of my affairs already, that I take it he
must either let matters stop where they are and go away in silence, or
else he must know more.  Margaret! are you willing to let Mr. Ross see
your wrist?"

She threw one swift look of appeal in his eyes; but even as she did so
she seemed to make up her mind.  Without a word she raised her right
hand, so that the bracelet of spreading wings which covered the wrist
fell back, leaving the flesh bare.  Then an icy chill shot through me.

On her wrist was a thin red jagged line, from which seemed to hang red
stains like drops of blood!

She stood there, a veritable figure of patient pride.

Oh! but she looked proud!  Through all her sweetness, all her dignity,
all her high-souled negation of self which I had known, and which never
seemed more marked than now--through all the fire that seemed to shine
from the dark depths of her eyes into my very soul, pride shone
conspicuously.  The pride that has faith; the pride that is born of
conscious purity; the pride of a veritable queen of Old Time, when to
be royal was to be the first and greatest and bravest in all high
things. As we stood thus for some seconds, the deep, grave voice of her
father seemed to sound a challenge in my ears:

"What do you say now?"

My answer was not in words.  I caught Margaret's right hand in mine as
it fell, and, holding it tight, whilst with the other I pushed back the
golden cincture, stooped and kissed the wrist.  As I looked up at her,
but never letting go her hand, there was a look of joy on her face such
as I dream of when I think of heaven.  Then I faced her father.

"You have my answer, sir!"  His strong face looked gravely sweet.  He
only said one word as he laid his hand on our clasped ones, whilst he
bent over and kissed his daughter:

"Good!"

We were interrupted by a knock at the door.  In answer to an impatient
"Come in!" from Mr. Trelawny, Mr. Corbeck entered.  When he saw us
grouped he would have drawn back; but in an instant Mr. Trelawny had
sprung forth and dragged him forward.  As he shook him by both hands,
he seemed a transformed man.  All the enthusiasm of his youth, of which
Mr. Corbeck had told us, seemed to have come back to him in an instant.

"So you have got the lamps!" he almost shouted.  "My reasoning was
right after all. Come to the library, where we will be alone, and tell
me all about it!  And while he does it, Ross," said he, turning to me,
"do you, like a good fellow, get the key from the safe deposit, so that
I may have a look at the lamps!"

Then the three of them, the daughter lovingly holding her father's arm,
went into the library, whilst I hurried off to Chancery Lane.

When I returned with the key, I found them still engaged in the
narrative; but Doctor Winchester, who had arrived soon after I left,
was with them.  Mr. Trelawny, on hearing from Margaret of his great
attention and kindness, and how he had, under much pressure to the
contrary, steadfastly obeyed his written wishes, had asked him to
remain and listen.  "It will interest you, perhaps," he said, "to learn
the end of the story!"

We all had an early dinner together.  We sat after it a good while, and
then Mr. Trelawny said:

"Now, I think we had all better separate and go quietly to bed early.
We may have much to talk about tomorrow; and tonight I want to think."

Doctor Winchester went away, taking, with a courteous forethought, Mr.
Corbeck with him, and leaving me behind.  When the others had gone Mr.
Trelawny said:

"I think it will be well if you, too, will go home for tonight.  I want
to be quite alone with my daughter; there are many things I wish to
speak of to her, and to her alone. Perhaps, even tomorrow, I will be
able to tell you also of them; but in the meantime there will be less
distraction to us both if we are alone in the house."  I quite
understood and sympathised with his feelings; but the experiences of
the last few days were strong on me, and with some hesitation I said:

"But may it not be dangerous?  If you knew as we do--"  To my surprise
Margaret interrupted me:

"There will be no danger, Malcolm.  I shall be with Father!"  As she
spoke she clung to him in a protective way.  I said no more, but stood
up to go at once.  Mr. Trelawny said heartily:

"Come as early as you please, Ross.  Come to breakfast.  After it, you
and I will want to have a word together."  He went out of the room
quietly, leaving us together.  I clasped and kissed Margaret's hands,
which she held out to me, and then drew her close to me, and our lips
met for the first time.

I did not sleep much that night.  Happiness on the one side of my bed
and Anxiety on the other kept sleep away.  But if I had anxious care, I
had also happiness which had not equal in my life--or ever can have.
The night went by so quickly that the dawn seemed to rush on me, not
stealing as is its wont.

Before nine o'clock I was at Kensington.  All anxiety seemed to float
away like a cloud as I met Margaret, and saw that already the pallor of
her face had given to the rich bloom which I knew.  She told me that
her father had slept well, and that he would be with us soon.

"I do believe," she whispered, "that my dear and thoughtful Father has
kept back on purpose, so that I might meet you first, and alone!"

After breakfast Mr. Trelawny took us into the study, saying as he
passed in:

"I have asked Margaret to come too."  When we were seated, he said
gravely:

"I told you last night that we might have something to say to each
other.  I dare say that you may have thought that it was about Margaret
and yourself.  Isn't that so?"

"I thought so."

"Well, my boy, that is all right.  Margaret and I have been talking,
and I know her wishes."  He held out his hand.  When I wrung it, and
had kissed Margaret, who drew her chair close to mine, so that we could
hold hands as we listened, he went on, but with a certain
hesitation--it could hardly be called nervousness--which was new to me.

"You know a good deal of my hunt after this mummy and her belongings;
and I dare say you have guessed a good deal of my theories.  But these
at any rate I shall explain later, concisely and categorically, if it
be necessary.  What I want to consult you about now is this:  Margaret
and I disagree on one point.  I am about to make an experiment; the
experiment which is to crown all that I have devoted twenty years of
research, and danger, and labour to prepare for.  Through it we may
learn things that have been hidden from the eyes and the knowledge of
men for centuries; for scores of centuries.  I do not want my daughter
to be present; for I cannot blind myself to the fact that there may be
danger in it--great danger, and of an unknown kind.  I have, however,
already faced very great dangers, and of an unknown kind; and so has
that brave scholar who has helped me in the work.  As to myself, I am
willing to run any risk.  For science, and history, and philosophy may
benefit; and we may turn one old page of a wisdom unknown in this
prosaic age.  But for my daughter to run such a risk I am loth.  Her
young bright life is too precious to throw lightly away; now especially
when she is on the very threshold of new happiness.  I do not wish to
see her life given, as her dear mother's was--"

He broke down for a moment, and covered his eyes with his hands.  In an
instant Margaret was beside him, clasping him close, and kissing him,
and comforting him with loving words.  Then, standing erect, with one
hand on his head, she said:

"Father! mother did not bid you stay beside her, even when you wanted
to go on that journey of unknown danger to Egypt; though that country
was then upset from end to end with war and the dangers that follow
war. You have told me how she left you free to go as you wished; though
that she thought of danger for you and and feared it for you, is proved
by this!"  She held up her wrist with the scar that seemed to run
blood. "Now, mother's daughter does as mother would have done herself!"
Then she turned to me:

"Malcolm, you know I love you!  But love is trust; and you must trust
me in danger as well as in joy.  You and I must stand beside Father in
this unknown peril. Together we shall come through it; or together we
shall fail; together we shall die. That is my wish; my first wish to my
husband that is to be!  Do you not think that, as a daughter, I am
right?  Tell my Father what you think!"

She looked like a Queen stooping to plead.  My love for her grew and
grew.  I stood up beside her; and took her hand and said:

"Mr. Trelawny! in this Margaret and I are one!"

He took both our hands and held them hard.  Presently he said with deep
emotion:

"It is as her mother would have done!"

Mr. Corbeck and Doctor Winchester came exactly at the time appointed,
and joined us in the library.  Despite my great happiness I felt our
meeting to be a very solemn function.  For I could never forget the
strange things that had been; and the idea of the strange things which
might be, was with me like a cloud, pressing down on us all.  From the
gravity of my companions I gathered that each of them also was ruled by
some such dominating thought.

Instinctively we gathered our chairs into a circle round Mr. Trelawny,
who had taken the great armchair near the window.  Margaret sat by him
on his right, and I was next to her.  Mr. Corbeck was on his left, with
Doctor Winchester on the other side. After a few seconds of silence Mr.
Trelawny said to Mr. Corbeck:

"You have told Doctor Winchester all up to the present, as we arranged?"

"Yes," he answered; so Mr. Trelawny said:

"And I have told Margaret, so we all know!"  Then, turning to the
Doctor, he asked:

"And am I to take it that you, knowing all as we know it who have
followed the matter for years, wish to share in the experiment which we
hope to make?"  His answer was direct and uncompromising:

"Certainly!  Why, when this matter was fresh to me, I offered to go on
with it to the end.  Now that it is of such strange interest, I would
not miss it for anything which you could name.  Be quite easy in your
mind, Mr. Trelawny.  I am a scientist and an investigator of phenomena.
I have no one belonging to me or dependent on me.  I am quite alone,
and free to do what I like with my own--including my life!"  Mr.
Trelawny bowed gravely, and turning to Mr. Corbeck said:

"I have known your ideas for many years past, old friend; so I need ask
you nothing. As to Margaret and Malcolm Ross, they have already told me
their wishes in no uncertain way."  He paused a few seconds, as though
to put his thoughts or his words in order; then he began to explain his
views and intentions.  He spoke very carefully, seeming always to bear
in mind that some of us who listened were ignorant of the very root and
nature of some things touched upon, and explaining them to us as he
went on:

"The experiment which is before us is to try whether or no there is any
force, any reality, in the old Magic.  There could not possibly be more
favourable conditions for the test; and it is my own desire to do all
that is possible to make the original design effective.  That there is
some such existing power I firmly believe.  It might not be possible to
create, or arrange, or organise such a power in our own time; but I
take it that if in Old Time such a power existed, it may have some
exceptional survival.  After all, the Bible is not a myth; and we read
there that the sun stood still at a man's command, and that an ass--not
a human one--spoke.  And if the Witch at Endor could call up to Saul
the spirit of Samuel, why may not there have been others with equal
powers; and why may not one among them survive?  Indeed, we are told in
the Book of Samuel that the Witch of Endor was only one of many, and
her being consulted by Saul was a matter of chance.  He only sought one
among the many whom he had driven out of Israel; 'all those that had
Familiar Spirits, and the Wizards.'  This Egyptian Queen, Tera, who
reigned nearly two thousand years before Saul, had a Familiar, and was
a Wizard too.  See how the priests of her time, and those after it
tried to wipe out her name from the face of the earth, and put a curse
over the very door of her tomb so that none might ever discover the
lost name.  Ay, and they succeeded so well that even Manetho, the
historian of the Egyptian Kings, writing in the tenth century before
Christ, with all the lore of the priesthood for forty centuries behind
him, and with possibility of access to every existing record, could not
even find her name.  Did it strike any of you, in thinking of the late
events, who or what her Familiar was?"  There was an interruption, for
Doctor Winchester struck one hand loudly on the other as he ejaculated:

"The cat!  The mummy cat!  I knew it!"  Mr. Trelawny smiled over at him.

"You are right!  There is every indication that the Familiar of the
Wizard Queen was that cat which was mummied when she was, and was not
only placed in her tomb, but was laid in the sarcophagus with her.
That was what bit into my wrist, what cut me with sharp claws."  He
paused. Margaret's comment was a purely girlish one:

"Then my poor Silvio is acquitted!  I am glad!"  Her father stroked her
hair and went on:

"This woman seems to have had an extraordinary foresight.  Foresight
far, far beyond her age and the philosophy of her time.  She seems to
have seen through the weakness of her own religion, and even prepared
for emergence into a different world.  All her aspirations were for the
North, the point of the compass whence blew the cool invigorating
breezes that make life a joy.  From the first, her eyes seem to have
been attracted to the seven stars of the Plough from the fact, as
recorded in the hieroglyphics in her tomb, that at her birth a great
aerolite fell, from whose heart was finally extracted that Jewel of
Seven Stars which she regarded as the talisman of her life.  It seems
to have so far ruled her destiny that all her thought and care circled
round it.  The Magic Coffer, so wondrously wrought with seven sides, we
learn from the same source, came from the aerolite.  Seven was to her a
magic number; and no wonder.  With seven fingers on one hand, and seven
toes on one foot.  With a talisman of a rare ruby with seven stars in
the same position as in that constellation which ruled her birth, each
star of the seven having seven points--in itself a geological
wonder--it would have been odd if she had not been attracted by it.
Again, she was born, we learn in the Stele of her tomb, in the seventh
month of the year--the month beginning with the Inundation of the Nile.
Of which month the presiding Goddess was Hathor, the Goddess of her own
house, of the Antefs of the Theban line--the Goddess who in various
forms symbolises beauty, and pleasure, and resurrection.  Again, in
this seventh month--which, by later Egyptian astronomy began on October
28th, and ran to the 27th of our November--on the seventh day the
Pointer of the Plough just rises above the horizon of the sky at Thebes.

"In a marvellously strange way, therefore, are grouped into this
woman's life these various things.  The number seven; the Pole Star,
with the constellation of seven stars; the God of the month, Hathor,
who was her own particular God, the God of her family, the Antefs of
the Theban Dynasty, whose Kings' symbol it was, and whose seven forms
ruled love and the delights of life and resurrection.  If ever there
was ground for magic; for the power of symbolism carried into mystic
use; for a belief in finites spirits in an age which knew not the
Living God, it is here.

"Remember, too, that this woman was skilled in all the science of her
time.  Her wise and cautious father took care of that, knowing that by
her own wisdom she must ultimately combat the intrigues of the
Hierarchy.  Bear in mind that in old Egypt the science of Astronomy
began and was developed to an extraordinary height; and that Astrology
followed Astronomy in its progress.  And it is possible that in the
later developments of science with regard to light rays, we may yet
find that Astrology is on a scientific basis.  Our next wave of
scientific thought may deal with this.  I shall have something special
to call your minds to on this point presently.  Bear in mind also that
the Egyptians knew sciences, of which today, despite all our
advantages, we are profoundly ignorant.  Acoustics, for instance, an
exact science with the builders of the temples of Karnak, of Luxor, of
the Pyramids, is today a mystery to Bell, and Kelvin, and Edison, and
Marconi.  Again, these old miracle-workers probably understood some
practical way of using other forces, and amongst them the forces of
light that at present we do not dream of.  But of this matter I shall
speak later.  That Magic Coffer of Queen Tera is probably a magic box
in more ways than one.  It may--possibly it does--contain forces that
we wot not of.  We cannot open it; it must be closed from within.  How
then was it closed?  It is a coffer of solid stone, of amazing
hardness, more like a jewel than an ordinary marble, with a lid equally
solid; and yet all is so finely wrought that the finest tool made today
cannot be inserted under the flange.  How was it wrought to such
perfection?  How was the stone so chosen that those translucent patches
match the relations of the seven stars of the constellation?  How is
it, or from what cause, that when the starlight shines on it, it glows
from within--that when I fix the lamps in similar form the glow grows
greater still; and yet the box is irresponsive to ordinary light
however great?  I tell you that that box hides some great mystery of
science.  We shall find that the light will open it in some way:
either by striking on some substance, sensitive in a peculiar way to
its effect, or in releasing some greater power.  I only trust that in
our ignorance we may not so bungle things as to do harm to its
mechanism; and so deprive the knowledge of our time of a lesson handed
down, as by a miracle, through nearly five thousand years.

"In another way, too, there may be hidden in that box secrets which,
for good or ill, may enlighten the world.  We know from their records,
and inferentially also, that the Egyptians studied the properties of
herbs and minerals for magic purposes--white magic as well as black.
We know that some of the wizards of old could induce from sleep dreams
of any given kind.  That this purpose was mainly effected by hypnotism,
which was another art or science of Old Nile, I have little doubt.  But
still, they must have had a mastery of drugs that is far beyond
anything we know.  With our own pharmacopoeia we can, to a certain
extent, induce dreams.  We may even differentiate between good and
bad--dreams of pleasure, or disturbing and harrowing dreams.  But these
old practitioners seemed to have been able to command at will any form
or colour of dreaming; could work round any given subject or thought in
almost any was required.  In that coffer, which you have seen, may rest
a very armoury of dreams.  Indeed, some of the forces that lie within
it may have been already used in my household."  Again there was an
interruption from Doctor Winchester.

"But if in your case some of these imprisoned forces were used, what
set them free at the opportune time, or how?  Besides, you and Mr.
Corbeck were once before put into a trance for three whole days, when
you were in the Queen's tomb for the second time.  And then, as I
gathered from Mr. Corbeck's story, the coffer was not back in the tomb,
though the mummy was.  Surely in both these cases there must have been
some active intelligence awake, and with some other power to wield."
Mr. Trelawny's answer was equally to the point:

"There was some active intelligence awake.  I am convinced of it.  And
it wielded a power which it never lacks.  I believe that on both those
occasions hypnotism was the power wielded."

"And wherein is that power contained?  What view do you hold on the
subject?" Doctor Winchester's voice vibrated with the intensity of his
excitement as he leaned forward, breathing hard, and with eyes staring.
Mr. Trelawny said solemnly:

"In the mummy of the Queen Tera!  I was coming to that presently.
Perhaps we had better wait till I clear the ground a little.  What I
hold is, that the preparation of that box was made for a special
occasion; as indeed were all the preparations of the tomb and all
belonging to it.  Queen Tera did not trouble herself to guard against
snakes and scorpions, in that rocky tomb cut in the sheer cliff face a
hundred feet above the level of the valley, and fifty down from the
summit.  Her precautions were against the disturbances of human hands;
against the jealousy and hatred of the priests, who, had they known of
her real aims, would have tried to baffle them.  From her point of
view, she made all ready for the time of resurrection, whenever that
might be. I gather from the symbolic pictures in the tomb that she so
far differed from the belief of her time that she looked for a
resurrection in the flesh.  It was doubtless this that intensified the
hatred of the priesthood, and gave them an acceptable cause for
obliterating the very existence, present and future, of one who had
outrage their theories and blasphemed their gods.  All that she might
require, either in the accomplishment of the resurrection or after it,
were contained in that almost hermetically sealed suite of chambers in
the rock.  In the great sarcophagus, which as you know is of a size
quite unusual even for kings, was the mummy of her Familiar, the cat,
which from its great size I take to be a sort of tiger-cat.  In the
tomb, also in a strong receptacle, were the canopic jars usually
containing those internal organs which are separately embalmed, but
which in this case had no such contents.  So that, I take it, there was
in her case a departure in embalming; and that the organs were restored
to the body, each in its proper place--if, indeed, they had ever been
removed.  If this surmise be true, we shall find that the brain of the
Queen either was never extracted in the usual way, or, if so taken out,
that it was duly replaced, instead of being enclosed within the mummy
wrappings. Finally, in the sarcophagus there was the Magic Coffer on
which her feet rested.  Mark you also, the care taken in the
preservance of her power to control the elements.  According to her
belief, the open hand outside the wrappings controlled the Air, and the
strange Jewel Stone with the shining stars controlled Fire.  The
symbolism inscribed on the soles of her feet gave sway over Land and
Water.  About the Star Stone I shall tell you later; but whilst we are
speaking of the sarcophagus, mark how she guarded her secret in case of
grave-wrecking or intrusion.  None could open her Magic Coffer without
the lamps, for we know now that ordinary light will not be effective.
The great lid of the sarcophagus was not sealed down as usual, because
she wished to control the air. But she hid the lamps, which in
structure belong to the Magic Coffer, in a place where none could find
them, except by following the secret guidance which she had prepared
for only the eyes of wisdom.  And even here she had guarded against
chance discovery, by preparing a bolt of death for the unwary
discoverer.  To do this she had applied the lesson of the tradition of
the avenging guard of the treasures of the pyramid, built by her great
predecessor of the Fourth Dynasty of the throne of Egypt.

"You have noted, I suppose, how there were, in the case of her tomb,
certain deviations from the usual rules.  For instance, the shaft of
the Mummy Pit, which is usually filled up solid with stones and
rubbish, was left open.  Why was this?  I take it that she had made
arrangements for leaving the tomb when, after her resurrection, she
should be a new woman, with a different personality, and less inured to
the hardships that in her first existence she had suffered.  So far as
we can judge of her intent, all things needful for her exit into the
world had been thought of, even to the iron chain, described by Van
Huyn, close to the door in the rock, by which she might be able to
lower herself to the ground.  That she expected a long period to elapse
was shown in the choice of material.  An ordinary rope would be
rendered weaker or unsafe in process of time, but she imagined, and
rightly, that the iron would endure.

"What her intentions were when once she trod the open earth afresh we
do not know, and we never shall, unless her own dead lips can soften
and speak."




Chapter XV

The Purpose of Queen Tera


"Now, as to the Star Jewel!  This she manifestly regarded as the
greatest of her treasures.  On it she had engraven words which none of
her time dared to speak.

"In the old Egyptian belief it was held that there were words, which,
if used properly--for the method of speaking them was as important as
the words themselves--could command the Lords of the Upper and the
Lower Worlds.  The 'hekau', or word of power, was all-important in
certain ritual.  On the Jewel of Seven Stars, which, as you know, is
carved into the image of a scarab, are graven in hieroglyphic two such
hekau, one above, the other underneath.  But you will understand better
when you see it!  Wait here!  Do not stir!"

As he spoke, he rose and left the room.  A great fear for him came over
me; but I was in some strange way relieved when I looked at Margaret.
Whenever there had been any possibility of danger to her father, she
had shown great fear for him; now she was calm and placid.  I said
nothing, but waited.

In two or three minutes, Mr. Trelawny returned.  He held in his hand a
little golden box.  This, as he resumed his seat, he placed before him
on the table.  We all leaned forward as he opened it.

On a lining of white satin lay a wondrous ruby of immense size, almost
as big as the top joint of Margaret's little finger.  It was carven--it
could not possibly have been its natural shape, but jewels do not show
the working of the tool--into the shape of a scarab, with its wings
folded, and its legs and feelers pressed back to its sides. Shining
through its wondrous "pigeon's blood" colour were seven different
stars, each of seven points, in such position that they reproduced
exactly the figure of the Plough.  There could be no possible mistake
as to this in the mind of anyone who had ever noted the constellation.
On it were some hieroglyphic figures, cut with the most exquisite
precision, as I could see when it came to my turn to use the
magnifying-glass, which Mr. Trelawny took from his pocket and handed to
us.

When we all had seen it fully, Mr. Trelawny turned it over so that it
rested on its back in a cavity made to hold it in the upper half of the
box.  The reverse was no less wonderful than the upper, being carved to
resemble the under side of the beetle.  It, too, had some hieroglyphic
figures cut on it.  Mr. Trelawny resumed his lecture as we all sat with
our heads close to this wonderful jewel:

"As you see, there are two words, one on the top, the other underneath.
The symbols on the top represent a single word, composed of one
syllable prolonged, with its determinatives.  You know, all of you, I
suppose, that the Egyptian language was phonetic, and that the
hieroglyphic symbol represented the sound.  The first symbol here, the
hoe, means 'mer', and the two pointed ellipses the prolongation of the
final r: mer-r-r.  The sitting figure with the hand to its face is what
we call the 'determinative' of 'thought'; and the roll of papyrus that
of 'abstraction'.  Thus we get the word 'mer', love, in its abstract,
general, and fullest sense.  This is the hekau which can command the
Upper World."

Margaret's face was a glory as she said in a deep, low, ringing tone:

"Oh, but it is true.  How the old wonder-workers guessed at almighty
Truth!"  Then a hot blush swept her face, and her eyes fell.  Her
father smiled at her lovingly as he resumed:

"The symbolisation of the word on the reverse is simpler, though the
meaning is more abstruse.  The first symbol means 'men', 'abiding', and
the second, 'ab', 'the heart'.  So that we get 'abiding of heart', or
in our own language 'patience'.  And this is the hekau to control the
Lower World!"

He closed the box, and motioning us to remain as we were, he went back
to his room to replace the Jewel in the safe.  When he had returned and
resumed his seat, he went on:

"That Jewel, with its mystic words, and which Queen Tera held under her
hand in the sarcophagus, was to be an important factor--probably the
most important--in the working out of the act of her resurrection.
From the first I seemed by a sort of instinct to realise this.  I kept
the Jewel within my great safe, whence none could extract it; not even
Queen Tera herself with her astral body."

"Her 'astral body'?  What is that, Father?  What does that mean?" There
was a keenness in Margaret's voice as she asked the question which
surprised me a little; but Trelawny smiled a sort of indulgent parental
smile, which came through his grim solemnity like sunshine through a
rifted cloud, as he spoke:

"The astral body, which is a part of Buddhist belief, long subsequent
to the time I speak of, and which is an accepted fact of modern
mysticism, had its rise in Ancient Egypt; at least, so far as we know.
It is that the gifted individual can at will, quick as thought itself,
transfer his body whithersoever he chooses, by the dissolution and
reincarnation of particles.  In the ancient belief there were several
parts of a human being.  You may as well know them; so that you will
understand matters relative to them or dependent on them as they occur.

"First there is the 'Ka', or 'Double', which, as Doctor Budge explains,
may be defined as 'an abstract individuality of personality' which was
imbued with all the characteristic attributes of the individual it
represented, and possessed an absolutely independent existence.  It was
free to move from place to place on earth at will; and it could enter
into heaven and hold converse with the gods.  Then there was the 'Ba',
or 'soul', which dwelt in the 'Ka', and had the power of becoming
corporeal or incorporeal at will; 'it had both substance and form....
It had power to leave the tomb.... It could revisit the body in the
tomb ... and could reincarnate it and hold converse with it.'  Again
there was the 'Khu', the 'spiritual intelligence', or spirit. It took
the form of 'a shining, luminous, intangible shape of the body.'...
Then, again, there was the 'Sekhem', or 'power' of a man, his strength
or vital force personified.  These were the 'Khaibit', or 'shadow', the
'Ren', or 'name', the 'Khat', or 'physical body', and 'Ab', the
'heart', in which life was seated, went to the full making up of a man.

"Thus you will see, that if this division of functions, spiritual and
bodily, ethereal and corporeal, ideal and actual, be accepted as exact,
there are all the possibilities and capabilities of corporeal
transference, guided always by an unimprisonable will or intelligence."
As he paused I murmured the lines from Shelley's "Prometheus Unbound":

     "'The Magnus Zoroaster...
     Met his own image walking in the garden.'"

Mr. Trelawny was not displeased.  "Quite so!" he said, in his quiet
way. "Shelley had a better conception of ancient beliefs than any of
our poets."  With a voice changed again he resumed his lecture, for so
it was to some of us:

"There is another belief of the ancient Egyptian which you must bear in
mind; that regarding the ushaptiu figures of Osiris, which were placed
with the dead to its work in the Under World.  The enlargement of this
idea came to a belief that it was possible to transmit, by magical
formulae, the soul and qualities of any living creature to a figure
made in its image.  This would give a terrible extension of power to
one who held the gift of magic.

"It is from a union of these various beliefs, and their natural
corollaries, that I have come to the conclusion that Queen Tera
expected to be able to effect her own resurrection, when, and where,
and how, she would.  That she may have held before her a definite time
for making her effort is not only possible but likely.  I shall not
stop now to explain it, but shall enter upon the subject later on.
With a soul with the Gods, a spirit which could wander the earth at
will, and a power of corporeal transference, or an astral body, there
need be no bounds or limits to her ambition. The belief is forced upon
us that for these forty or fifty centuries she lay dormant in her
tomb--waiting.  Waiting with that 'patience' which could rule the Gods
of the Under World, for that 'love' which could command those of the
Upper World.  What she may have dreamt we know not; but her dream must
have been broken when the Dutch explorer entered her sculptured cavern,
and his follower violated the sacred privacy of her tomb by his rude
outrage in the theft of her hand.

"That theft, with all that followed, proved to us one thing, however:
that each part of her body, though separated from the rest, can be a
central point or rallying place for the items or particles of her
astral body.  That hand in my room could ensure her instantaneous
presence in the flesh, and its equally rapid dissolution.

"Now comes the crown of my argument.  The purpose of the attack on me
was to get the safe open, so that the sacred Jewel of Seven Stars could
be extracted.  That immense door of the safe could not keep out her
astral body, which, or any part of it, could gather itself as well
within as without the safe.  And I doubt not that in the darkness of
the night that mummied hand sought often the Talisman Jewel, and drew
new inspiration from its touch.  But despite all its power, the astral
body could not remove the Jewel through the chinks of the safe.  The
Ruby is not astral; and it could only be moved in the ordinary way by
the opening of the doors.  To this end, the Queen used her astral body
and the fierce force of her Familiar, to bring to the keyhole of the
safe the master key which debarred her wish.  For years I have
suspected, nay, have believed as much; and I, too, guarded myself
against powers of the Nether World.  I, too, waited in patience till I
should have gathered together all the factors required for the opening
of the Magic Coffer and the resurrection of the mummied Queen!"  He
paused, and his daughter's voice came out sweet and clear, and full of
intense feeling:

"Father, in the Egyptian belief, was the power of resurrection of a
mummied body a general one, or was it limited?  That is:  could it
achieve resurrection many times in the course of ages; or only once,
and that one final?"

"There was but one resurrection," he answered.  "There were some who
believed that this was to be a definite resurrection of the body into
the real world.  But in the common belief, the Spirit found joy in the
Elysian Fields, where there was plenty of food and no fear of famine.
Where there was moisture and deep-rooted reeds, and all the joys that
are to be expected by the people of an arid land and burning clime."

Then Margaret spoke with an earnestness which showed the conviction of
her inmost soul:

"To me, then, it is given to understand what was the dream of this
great and far-thinking and high-souled lady of old; the dream that held
her soul in patient waiting for its realisation through the passing of
all those tens of centuries.  The dream of a love that might be; a love
that she felt she might, even under new conditions, herself evoke.  The
love that is the dream of every woman's life; of the Old and of the
New; Pagan or Christian; under whatever sun; in whatever rank or
calling; however may have been the joy or pain of her life in other
ways.  Oh!  I know it!  I know it!  I am a woman, and I know a woman's
heart.  What were the lack of food or the plenitude of it; what were
feast or famine to this woman, born in a palace, with the shadow of the
Crown of the Two Egypts on her brows!  What were reedy morasses or the
tinkle of running water to her whose barges could sweep the great Nile
from the mountains to the sea.  What were petty joys and absence of
petty fears to her, the raising of whose hand could hurl armies, or
draw to the water-stairs of her palaces the commerce of the world!  At
whose word rose temples filled with all the artistic beauty of the
Times of Old which it was her aim and pleasure to restore!  Under whose
guidance the solid rock yawned into the sepulchre that she designed!

"Surely, surely, such a one had nobler dreams!  I can feel them in my
heart; I can see them with my sleeping eyes!"

As she spoke she seemed to be inspired; and her eyes had a far-away
look as though they saw something beyond mortal sight.  And then the
deep eyes filled up with unshed tears of great emotion.  The very soul
of the woman seemed to speak in her voice; whilst we who listened sat
entranced.

"I can see her in her loneliness and in the silence of her mighty
pride, dreaming her own dream of things far different from those around
her. Of some other land, far, far away under the canopy of the silent
night, lit by the cool, beautiful light of the stars.  A land under
that Northern star, whence blew the sweet winds that cooled the
feverish desert air.  A land of wholesome greenery, far, far away.
Where were no scheming and malignant priesthood; whose ideas were to
lead to power through gloomy temples and more gloomy caverns of the
dead, through an endless ritual of death!  A land where love was not
base, but a divine possession of the soul!  Where there might be some
one kindred spirit which could speak to hers through mortal lips like
her own; whose being could merge with hers in a sweet communion of soul
to soul, even as their breaths could mingle in the ambient air!  I know
the feeling, for I have shared it myself.  I may speak of it now, since
the blessing has come into my own life.  I may speak of it since it
enables me to interpret the feelings, the very longing soul, of that
sweet and lovely Queen, so different from her surroundings, so high
above her time! Whose nature, put into a word, could control the forces
of the Under World; and the name of whose aspiration, though but graven
on a star-lit jewel, could command all the powers in the Pantheon of
the High Gods.

"And in the realisation of that dream she will surely be content to
rest!"

We men sat silent, as the young girl gave her powerful interpretation
of the design or purpose of the woman of old.  Her every word and tone
carried with it the conviction of her own belief.  The loftiness of her
thoughts seemed to uplift us all as we listened.  Her noble words,
flowing in musical cadence and vibrant with internal force, seemed to
issue from some great instrument of elemental power.  Even her tone was
new to us all; so that we listened as to some new and strange being
from a new and strange world.  Her father's face was full of delight.
I knew now its cause.  I understood the happiness that had come into
his life, on his return to the world that he knew, from that prolonged
sojourn in the world of dreams.  To find in his daughter, whose nature
he had never till now known, such a wealth of affection, such a
splendour of spiritual insight, such a scholarly imagination, such...
The rest of his feeling was of hope!

The two other men were silent unconsciously.  One man had had his
dreaming; for the other, his dreams were to come.

For myself, I was like one in a trance.  Who was this new, radiant
being who had won to existence out of the mist and darkness of our
fears? Love has divine possibilities for the lover's heart!  The wings
of the soul may expand at any time from the shoulders of the loved one,
who then may sweep into angel form.  I knew that in my Margaret's
nature were divine possibilities of many kinds.  When under the shade
of the overhanging willow-tree on the river, I had gazed into the
depths of her beautiful eyes, I had thenceforth a strict belief in the
manifold beauties and excellences of her nature; but this soaring and
understanding spirit was, indeed, a revelation.  My pride, like her
father's, was outside myself; my joy and rapture were complete and
supreme!

When we had all got back to earth again in our various ways, Mr.
Trelawny, holding his daughter's hand in his, went on with his
discourse:

"Now, as to the time at which Queen Tera intended her resurrection to
take place! We are in contact with some of the higher astronomical
calculations in connection with true orientation.  As you know, the
stars shift their relative positions in the heavens; but though the
real distances traversed are beyond all ordinary comprehension, the
effects as we see them are small.  Nevertheless, they are susceptible
of measurement, not by years, indeed, but by centuries.  It was by this
means that Sir John Herschel arrived at the date of the building of the
Great Pyramid--a date fixed by the time necessary to change the star of
the true north from Draconis to the Pole Star, and since then verified
by later discoveries.  From the above there can be no doubt whatever
that astronomy was an exact science with the Egyptians at least a
thousand years before the time of Queen Tera.  Now, the stars that go
to make up a constellation change in process of time their relative
positions, and the Plough is a notable example.  The changes in the
position of stars in even forty centuries is so small as to be hardly
noticeable by an eye not trained to minute observances, but they can be
measured and verified.  Did you, or any of you, notice how exactly the
stars in the Ruby correspond to the position of the stars in the
Plough; or how the same holds with regard to the translucent places in
the Magic Coffer?"

We all assented.  He went on:

"You are quite correct.  They correspond exactly.  And yet when Queen
Tera was laid in her tomb, neither the stars in the Jewel nor the
translucent places in the Coffer corresponded to the position of the
stars in the Constellation as they then were!"

We looked at each other as he paused:  a new light was breaking upon
us. With a ring of mastery in his voice he went on:

"Do you not see the meaning of this?  Does it not throw a light on the
intention of the Queen?  She, who was guided by augury, and magic, and
superstition, naturally chose a time for her resurrection which seemed
to have been pointed out by the High Gods themselves, who had sent
their message on a thunderbolt from other worlds.  When such a time was
fixed by supernal wisdom, would it not be the height of human wisdom to
avail itself of it?  Thus it is"--here his voice deepened and trembled
with the intensity of his feeling--"that to us and our time is given
the opportunity of this wondrous peep into the old world, such as has
been the privilege of none other of our time; which may never be again.

"From first to last the cryptic writing and symbolism of that wondrous
tomb of that wondrous woman is full of guiding light; and the key of
the many mysteries lies in that most wondrous Jewel which she held in
her dead hand over the dead heart, which she hoped and believed would
beat again in a newer and nobler world!

"There are only loose ends now to consider.  Margaret has given us the
true inwardness of the feeling of the other Queen!"  He looked at her
fondly, and stroked her hand as he said it.  "For my own part I
sincerely hope she is right; for in such case it will be a joy, I am
sure, to all of us to assist at such a realisation of hope.  But we
must not go too fast, or believe too much in our present state of
knowledge. The voice that we hearken for comes out of times strangely
other than our own; when human life counted for little, and when the
morality of the time made little account of the removing of obstacles
in the way to achievement of  desire. We must keep our eyes fixed on
the scientific side, and wait for the developments on the psychic side.

"Now, as to this stone box, which we call the Magic Coffer.  As I have
said, I am convinced that it opens only in obedience to some principle
of light, or the exercise of some of its forces at present unknown to
us.  There is here much ground for conjecture and for experiment; for
as yet the scientists have not thoroughly differentiated the kinds, and
powers, and degrees of light.  Without analysing various rays we may, I
think, take it for granted that there are different qualities and
powers of light; and this great field of scientific investigation is
almost virgin soil.  We know as yet so little of natural forces, that
imagination need set no bounds to its flights in considering the
possibilities of the future.  Within but a few years we have made such
discoveries as two centuries ago would have sent the discoverer's to
the flames.  The liquefaction of oxygen; the existence of radium, of
helium, of polonium, of argon; the different powers of Roentgen and
Cathode and Bequerel rays.  And as we may finally prove that there are
different kinds and qualities of light, so we may find that combustion
may have its own powers of differentiation; that there are qualities in
some flames non-existent in others.  It may be that some of the
essential conditions of substance are continuous, even in the
destruction of their bases. Last night I was thinking of this, and
reasoning that as there are certain qualities in some oils which are
not in others, so there may be certain similar or corresponding
qualities or powers in the combinations of each.  I suppose we have all
noticed some time or other that the light of colza oil is not quite the
same as that of paraffin, or that the flames of coal gas and whale oil
are different.  They find it so in the light-houses! All at once it
occurred to me that there might be some special virtue in the oil which
had been found in the jars when Queen Tera's tomb was opened.  These
had not been used to preserve the intestines as usual, so they must
have been placed there for some other purpose.  I remembered that in
Van Huyn's narrative he had commented on the way the jars were sealed.
This was lightly, though effectually; they could be opened without
force.  The jars were themselves preserved in a sarcophagus which,
though of immense strength and hermetically sealed, could be opened
easily.  Accordingly, I went at once to examine the jars.  A little--a
very little of the oil still remained, but it had grown thick in the
two and a half centuries in which the jars had been open.  Still, it
was not rancid; and on examining it I found it was cedar oil, and that
it still exhaled something of its original aroma. This gave me the idea
that it was to be used to fill the lamps.  Whoever had placed the oil
in the jars, and the jars in the sarcophagus, knew that there might be
shrinkage in process of time, even in vases of alabaster, and fully
allowed for it; for each of the jars would have filled the lamps half a
dozen times.  With part of the oil remaining I made some experiments,
therefore, which may give useful results.  You know, Doctor, that cedar
oil, which was much used in the preparation and ceremonials of the
Egyptian dead, has a certain refractive power which we do not find in
other oils.  For instance, we use it on the lenses of our microscopes
to give additional clearness of vision.  Last night I put some in one
of the lamps, and placed it near a translucent part of the Magic
Coffer.  The effect was very great; the glow of light within was fuller
and more intense than I could have imagined, where an electric light
similarly placed had little, if any, effect.  I should have tried
others of the seven lamps, but that my supply of oil ran out. This,
however, is on the road to rectification.  I have sent for more cedar
oil, and expect to have before long an ample supply.  Whatever may
happen from other causes, our experiment shall not, at all events, fail
from this.  We shall see!  We shall see!"

Doctor Winchester had evidently been following the logical process of
the other's mind, for his comment was:

"I do hope that when the light is effective in opening the box, the
mechanism will not be impaired or destroyed."

His doubt as to this gave anxious thought to some of us.




Chapter XVI

The Cavern


In the evening Mr. Trelawny took again the whole party into the study.
When we were all attention he began to unfold his plans:

"I have come to the conclusion that for the proper carrying out of what
we will call our Great Experiment we must have absolute and complete
isolation.  Isolation not merely for a day or two, but for as long as
we may require.  Here such a thing would be impossible; the needs and
habits of a great city with its ingrained possibilities of
interruption, would, or might, quite upset us.  Telegrams, registered
letters, or express messengers would alone be sufficient; but the great
army of those who want to get something would make disaster certain.
In addition, the occurrences of the last week have drawn police
attention to this house.  Even if special instructions to keep an eye
on it have not been issued from Scotland Yard or the District Station,
you may be sure that the individual policeman on his rounds will keep
it well under observation.  Besides, the servants who have discharged
themselves will before long begin to talk.  They must; for they have,
for the sake of their own characters, to give some reason for the
termination of a service which has I should say a position in the
neighbourhood.  The servants of the neighbours will begin to talk, and,
perhaps the neighbours themselves.  Then the active and intelligent
Press will, with its usual zeal for the enlightenment of the public and
its eye to increase of circulation, get hold of the matter.  When the
reporter is after us we shall not have much chance of privacy.  Even if
we were to bar ourselves in, we should not be free from interruption,
possibly from intrusion.  Either would ruin our plans, and so we must
take measures to effect a retreat, carrying all our impedimenta with
us.  For this I am prepared.  For a long time past I have foreseen such
a possibility, and have made preparation for it.  Of course, I had no
foreknowledge of what has happened; but I knew something would, or
might, happen.  For more than two years past my house in Cornwall has
been made ready to receive all the curios which are preserved here.
When Corbeck went off on his search for the lamps I had the old house
at Kyllion made ready; it is fitted with electric light all over, and
all the appliances for manufacture of the light are complete.  I had
perhaps better tell you, for none of you, not even Margaret, knows
anything of it, that the house is absolutely shut out from public
access or even from view.  It stands on a little rocky promontory
behind a steep hill, and except from the sea cannot be seen.  Of old it
was fenced in by a high stone wall, for the house which it succeeded
was built by an ancestor of mine in the days when a great house far
away from a centre had to be prepared to defend itself. Here, then, is
a place so well adapted to our needs that it might have been prepared
on purpose.  I shall explain it to you when we are all there.  This
will not be long, for already our movement is in train.  I have sent
word to Marvin to have all preparation for our transport ready.  He is
to have a special train, which is to run at night so as to avoid
notice.  Also a number of carts and stone-wagons, with sufficient men
and appliances to take all our packing-cases to Paddington.  We shall
be away before the Argus-eyed Pressman is on the watch.  We shall today
begin our packing up; and I dare say that by tomorrow night we shall be
ready.  In the outhouses I have all the packing-cases which were used
for bringing the things from Egypt, and I am satisfied that as they
were sufficient for the journey across the desert and down the Nile to
Alexandria and thence on to London, they will serve without fail
between here and Kyllion.  We four men, with Margaret to hand us such
things as we may require, will be able to get the things packed safely;
and the carrier's men will take them to the trucks.

"Today the servants go to Kyllion, and Mrs. Grant will make such
arrangements as may be required.  She will take a stock of necessaries
with her, so that we will not attract local attention by our daily
needs; and will keep us supplied with perishable food from London.
Thanks to Margaret's wise and generous treatment of the servants who
decided to remain, we have got a staff on which we can depend.  They
have been already cautioned to secrecy, so that we need not fear gossip
from within. Indeed, as the servants will be in London after their
preparations at Kyllion are complete, there will not be much subject
for gossip, in detail at any rate.

"As, however, we should commence the immediate work of packing at once,
we will leave over the after proceedings till later when we have
leisure."

Accordingly we set about our work.  Under Mr. Trelawny's guidance, and
aided by the servants, we took from the outhouses great packing-cases.
Some of these were of enormous strength, fortified by many thicknesses
of wood, and by iron bands and rods with screw-ends and nuts.  We
placed them throughout the house, each close to the object which it was
to contain.  When this preliminary work had been effected, and there
had been placed in each room and in the hall great masses of new hay,
cotton-waste and paper, the servants were sent away.  Then we set about
packing.

No one, not accustomed to packing, could have the slightest idea of the
amount of the amount of work involved in such a task as that in which
in we were engaged.  For my own part I had had a vague idea that there
were a large number of Egyptian objects in Mr. Trelawny's house; but
until I came to deal with them seriatim I had little idea of either
their importance, the size of some of them, or of their endless number.
Far into the night we worked.  At times we used all the strength which
we could muster on a single object; again we worked separately, but
always under Mr. Trelawny's immediate direction.  He himself, assisted
by Margaret, kept an exact tall of each piece.

It was only when we sat down, utterly wearied, to a long-delayed supper
that we began to realised that a large part of the work was done.  Only
a few of the packing-cases, however, were closed; for a vast amount of
work still remained.  We had finished some of the cases, each of which
held only one of the great sarcophagi. The cases which held many
objects could not be closed till all had been differentiated and packed.

I slept that night without movement or without dreams; and on our
comparing notes in the morning, I found that each of the others had had
the same experience.

By dinner-time next evening the whole work was complete, and all was
ready for the carriers who were to come at midnight.  A little before
the appointed time we heard the rumble of carts; then we were shortly
invaded by an army of workmen, who seemed by sheer force of numbers to
move without effort, in an endless procession, all our prepared
packages.  A little over an hour sufficed them, and when the carts had
rumbled away, we all got ready to follow them to Paddington.  Silvio
was of course to be taken as one of our party.

Before leaving we went in a body over the house, which looked desolate
indeed.  As the servants had all gone to Cornwall there had been no
attempt at tidying-up; every room and passage in which we had worked,
and all the stairways, were strewn with paper and waste, and marked
with dirty feet.

The last thing which Mr. Trelawny did before coming away was to take
from the great safe the Ruby with the Seven Stars.  As he put it safely
into his pocket-book, Margaret, who had all at once seemed to grow
deadly tired and stood beside her father pale and rigid, suddenly
became all aglow, as though the sight of the Jewel had inspired her.
She smiled at her father approvingly as she said:

"You are right, Father.  There will not be any more trouble tonight.
She will not wreck your arrangements for any cause.  I would stake my
life upon it."

"She--or something--wrecked us in the desert when we had come from the
tomb in the Valley of the Sorcerer!" was the grim comment of Corbeck,
who was standing by. Margaret answered him like a flash:

"Ah! she was then near her tomb from which for thousands of years her
body had not been moved.  She must know that things are different now."

"How must she know?" asked Corbeck keenly.

"If she has that astral body that Father spoke of, surely she must
know! How can she fail to, with an invisible presence and an intellect
that can roam abroad even to the stars and the worlds beyond us!"  She
paused, and her father said solemnly:

"It is on that supposition that we are proceeding.  We must have the
courage of our convictions, and act on them--to the last!"

Margaret took his hand and held it in a dreamy kind of way as we filed
out of the house.  She was holding it still when he locked the hall
door, and when we moved up the road to the gateway, whence we took a
cab to Paddington.

When all the goods were loaded at the station, the whole of the workmen
went on to the train; this took also some of the stone-wagons used for
carrying the cases with the great sarcophagi.  Ordinary carts and
plenty of horses were to be found at Westerton, which was our station
for Kyllion.  Mr. Trelawny had ordered a sleeping-carriage for our
party; as soon as the train had started we all turned into our cubicles.

That night I slept sound.  There was over me a conviction of security
which was absolute and supreme.  Margaret's definite announcement:
"There will not be any trouble tonight!" seemed to carry assurance with
it.  I did not question it; nor did anyone else.  It was only
afterwards that I began to think as to how she was so sure. The train
was a slow one, stopping many times and for considerable intervals.  As
Mr. Trelawny did not wish to arrive at Westerton before dark, there was
no need to hurry; and arrangements had been made to feed the workmen at
certain places on the journey.  We had our own hamper with us in the
private car.

All that afternoon we talked over the Great Experiment, which seemed to
have become a definite entity in our thoughts.  Mr. Trelawny became
more and more enthusiastic as the time wore on; hope was with him
becoming certainty.  Doctor Winchester seemed to become imbued with
some of his spirit, though at times he would throw out some scientific
fact which would either make an impasse to the other's line of
argument, or would come as an arresting shock.  Mr. Corbeck, on the
other hand, seemed slightly antagonistic to the theory.  It may have
been that whilst the opinions of the others advanced, his own stood
still; but the effect was an attitude which appeared negative, if not
wholly one of negation.

As for Margaret, she seemed to be in some way overcome.  Either it was
some new phase of feeling with her, or else she was taking the issue
more seriously than she had yet done.  She was generally more or less
distraite, as though sunk in a brown study; from this she would recover
herself with a start.  This was usually when there occurred some marked
episode in the journey, such as stopping at a station, or when the
thunderous rumble of crossing a viaduct woke the echoes of the hills or
cliffs around us.  On each such occasion she would plunge into the
conversation, taking such a part in it as to show that, whatever had
been her abstracted thought, her senses had taken in fully all that had
gone on around her.  Towards myself her manner was strange.  Sometimes
it was marked by a distance, half shy, half haughty, which was new to
me.  At other times there were moments of passion in look and gesture
which almost made me dizzy with delight.  Little, however, of a marked
nature transpired during the journey.  There was but one episode which
had in it any element of alarm, but as we were all asleep at the time
it did not disturb us. We only learned it from a communicative guard in
the morning.  Whilst running between Dawlish and Teignmouth the train
was stopped by a warning given by someone who moved a torch to and fro
right on the very track.  The driver had found on pulling up that just
ahead of the train a small landslip had taken place, some of the red
earth from the high bank having fallen away.  It did not however reach
to the metals; and the driver had resumed his way, none too well
pleased at the delay.  To use his own words, the guard thought "there
was too much bally caution on this 'ere line!'"

We arrived at Westerton about nine o'clock in the evening.  Carts and
horses were in waiting, and the work of unloading the train began at
once.  Our own party did not wait to see the work done, as it was in
the hands of competent people.  We took the carriage which was in
waiting, and through the darkness of the night sped on to Kyllion.

We were all impressed by the house as it appeared in the bright
moonlight.  A great grey stone mansion of the Jacobean period; vast and
spacious, standing high over the sea on the very verge of a high cliff.
When we had swept round the curve of the avenue cut through the rock,
and come out on the high plateau on which the house stood, the crash
and murmur of waves breaking against rock far below us came with an
invigorating breath of moist sea air.  We understood then in an instant
how well we were shut out from the world on that rocky shelf above the
sea.

Within the house we found all ready.  Mrs. Grant and her staff had
worked well, and all was bright and fresh and clean.  We took a brief
survey of the chief rooms and then separated to have a wash and to
change our clothes after our long journey of more than four-and-twenty
hours.

We had supper in the great dining-room on the south side, the walls of
which actually hung over the sea.  The murmur came up muffled, but it
never ceased.  As the little promontory stood well out into the sea,
the northern side of the house was open; and the due north was in no
way shut out by the great mass of rock, which, reared high above us,
shut out the rest of the world.  Far off across the bay we could see
the trembling lights of the castle, and here and there along the shore
the faint light of a fisher's window.  For the rest the sea was a dark
blue plain with an occasional flicker of light as the gleam of
starlight fell on the slope of a swelling wave.

When supper was over we all adjourned to the room which Mr. Trelawny
had set aside as his study, his bedroom being close to it.  As we
entered, the first thing I noticed was a great safe, somewhat similar
to that which stood in his room in London.  When we were in the room
Mr. Trelawny went over to the table, and, taking out his pocket-book,
laid it on the table.  As he did so he pressed down on it with the palm
of his hand.  A strange pallor came over his face.  With fingers that
trembled he opened the book, saying as he did so:

"Its bulk does not seem the same; I hope nothing has happened!"

All three of us men crowded round close.  Margaret alone remained calm;
she stood erect and silent, and still as a statue.  She had a far-away
look in her eyes, as though she did not either know or care what was
going on around her.

With a despairing gesture Trelawny threw open the pouch of the
pocket-book wherein he had placed the Jewel of Seven Stars.  As he sank
down on the chair which stood close to him, he said in a hoarse voice:

"My God! it is gone.  Without it the Great Experiment can come to
nothing!"

His words seemed to wake Margaret from her introspective mood.  An
agonised spasm swept her face; but almost on the instant she was calm.
She almost smiled as she said:

"You may have left it in your room, Father.  Perhaps it has fallen out
of the pocket-book whilst you were changing."  Without a word we all
hurried into the next room through the open door between the study and
the bedroom.  And then a sudden calm fell on us like a cloud of fear.

There! on the table, lay the Jewel of Seven Stars, shining and
sparkling with lurid light, as though each of the seven points of each
the seven stars gleamed through blood!

Timidly we each looked behind us, and then at each other.  Margaret was
now like the rest of us.  She had lost her statuesque calm.  All the
introspective rigidity had gone from her; and she clasped her hands
together till the knuckles were white.

Without a word Mr. Trelawny raised the Jewel, and hurried with it into
the next room.  As quietly as he could he opened the door of the safe
with the key fastened to his wrist and placed the Jewel within.  When
the heavy doors were closed and locked he seemed to breathe more freely.

Somehow this episode, though a disturbing one in many ways, seemed to
bring us back to our old selves.  Since we had left London we had all
been overstrained; and this was a sort of relief.  Another step in our
strange enterprise had been effected.

The change back was more marked in Margaret than in any of us.  Perhaps
it was that she was a woman, whilst we were men; perhaps it was that
she was younger than the rest; perhaps both reasons were effective,
each in its own way.  At any rate the change was there, and I was
happier than I had been through the long journey.  All her buoyancy,
her tenderness, her deep feeling seemed to shine forth once more; now
and again as her father's eyes rested on her, his face seemed to light
up.

Whilst we waited for the carts to arrive, Mr. Trelawny took us through
the house, pointing out and explaining where the objects which we had
brought with us were to be placed.  In one respect only did he withhold
confidence.  The positions of all those things which had connection
with the Great Experiment were not indicated. The cases containing them
were to be left in the outer hall, for the present.

By the time we had made the survey, the carts began to arrive; and the
stir and bustle of the previous night were renewed.  Mr. Trelawny stood
in the hall beside the massive ironbound door, and gave directions as
to the placing of each of the great packing-cases.  Those containing
many items were placed in the inner hall where they were to be unpacked.

In an incredibly short time the whole consignment was delivered; and
the men departed with a douceur for each, given through their foreman,
which made them effusive in their thanks.  Then we all went to our own
rooms.  There was a strange confidence over us all.  I do not think
that any one of us had a doubt as the the quiet passing of the
remainder of the night.

The faith was justified, for on our re-assembling in the morning we
found that all had slept well and peaceably.

During that day all the curios, except those required for the Great
Experiment, were put into the places designed for them.  Then it was
arranged that all the servants should go back with Mrs. Grant to London
on the next morning.

When they had all gone Mr. Trelawny, having seen the doors locked, took
us into the study.

"Now," said he when we were seated, "I have a secret to impart; but,
according to an old promise which does not leave me free, I must ask
you each to give me a solemn promise not to reveal it.  For three
hundred years at least such a promise has been exacted from everyone to
whom it was told, and more than once life and safety were secured
through loyal observance of the promise.  Even as it is, I am breaking
the letter, if not the spirit of the tradition; for I should only tell
it to the immediate members of my family."

We all gave the promise required.  Then he went on:

"There is a secret place in this house, a cave, natural originally but
finished by labour, underneath this house.  I will not undertake to say
that it has always been used according to the law.  During the Bloody
Assize more than a few Cornishmen found refuge in it; and later, and
earlier, it formed, I have no doubt whatever, a useful place for
storing contraband goods.  'Tre Pol and Pen', I suppose you know, have
always been smugglers; and their relations and friends and neighbours
have not held back from the enterprise.  For all such reasons a safe
hiding-place was always considered a valuable possession; and as the
heads of our House have always insisted on preserving the secret, I am
in honour bound to it.  Later on, if all be well, I shall of course
tell you, Margaret, and you too, Ross, under the conditions that I am
bound to make."

He rose up, and we all followed him.  Leaving us in the outer hall, he
went away alone for a few minutes; and returning, beckoned us to follow
him.

In the inside hall we found a whole section of an outstanding angle
moved away, and from the cavity saw a great hole dimly dark, and the
beginning of a rough staircase cut in the rock.  As it was not pitch
dark there was manifestly some means of lighting it naturally, so
without pause we followed our host as he descended.  After some forty
or fifty steps cut in a winding passage, we came to a great cave whose
further end tapered away into blackness.  It was a huge place, dimly
lit by a few irregular slits of eccentric shape.  Manifestly these were
faults in the rock which would readily allow the windows be disguised.
Close to each of them was a hanging shutter which could be easily swung
across by means of a dangling rope. The sound of the ceaseless beat of
the waves came up muffled from far below.  Mr. Trelawny at once began
to speak:

"This is the spot which I have chosen, as the best I know, for the
scene of our Great Experiment.  In a hundred different ways it fulfils
the conditions which I am led to believe are primary with regard to
success. Here, we are, and shall be, as isolated as Queen Tera herself
would have been in her rocky tomb in the Valley of the Sorcerer, and
still in a rocky cavern.  For good or ill we must here stand by our
chances, and abide by results.  If we are successful we shall be able
to let in on the world of modern science such a flood of light from the
Old World as will change every condition of thought and experiment and
practice.  If we fail, then even the knowledge of our attempt will die
with us.  For this, and all else which may come, I believe we are
prepared!"  He paused.  No one spoke, but we all bowed our heads
gravely in acquiescence.  He resumed, but with a certain hesitancy:

"It is not yet too late!  If any of you have a doubt or misgiving, for
God's sake speak it now!  Whoever it may be, can go hence without let or
hindrance.  The rest of us can go on our way alone!"

Again he paused, and looked keenly at us in turn.  We looked at each
other; but no one quailed.  For my own part, if I had had any doubt as
to going on, the look on Margaret's face would have reassured me.  It
was fearless; it was intense; it was full of a divine calm.

Mr. Trelawny took a long breath, and in a more cheerful, as well as in
a more decided tone, went on:

"As we are all of one mind, the sooner we get the necessary matters in
train the better.  Let me tell you that this place, like all the rest
of the house, can be lit with electricity.  We could not join the wires
to the mains lest our secret should become known, but I have a cable
here which we can attach in the hall and complete the circuit!"  As he
was speaking, he began to ascend the steps.  From close to the entrance
he took the end of a cable; this he drew forward and attached to a
switch in the wall.  Then, turning on a tap, he flooded the whole vault
and staircase below with light.  I could now see from the volume of
light streaming up into the hallway that the hole beside the staircase
went direct into the cave.  Above it was a pulley and a mass of strong
tackle with multiplying blocks of the Smeaton order.  Mr. Trelawny,
seeing me looking at this, said, correctly interpreting my thoughts:

"Yes! it is new.  I hung it there myself on purpose.  I knew we should
have to lower great weights; and as I did not wish to take too many
into my confidence, I arranged a tackle which I could work alone if
necessary."

We set to work at once; and before nightfall had lowered, unhooked, and
placed in the positions designated for each by Trelawny, all the great
sarcophagi and all the curios and other matters which we had taken with
us.

It was a strange and weird proceeding, the placing of those wonderful
monuments of a bygone age in that green cavern, which represented in
its cutting and purpose and up-to-date mechanism and electric lights
both the old world and the new.  But as time went on I grew more and
more to recognise the wisdom and correctness of Mr. Trelawny's choice.
I was much disturbed when Silvio, who had been brought into the cave in
the arms of his mistress, and who was lying asleep on my coat which I
had taken off, sprang up when the cat mummy had been unpacked, and flew
at it with the same ferocity which he had previously exhibited.  The
incident showed Margaret in a new phase, and one which gave my heart a
pang.  She had been standing quite still at one side of the cave
leaning on a sarcophagus, in one of those fits of abstraction which had
of late come upon her; but on hearing the sound, and seeing Silvio's
violent onslaught, she seemed to fall into a positive fury of passion.
Her eyes blazed, and her mouth took a hard, cruel tension which was new
to me. Instinctively she stepped towards Silvio as if to interfere in
the attack.  But I too had stepped forward; and as she caught my eye a
strange spasm came upon her, and she stopped.  Its intensity made me
hold my breath; and I put up my hand to clear my eyes.  When I had done
this, she had on the instant recovered her calm, and there was a look
of brief wonder on her face.  With all her old grace and sweetness she
swept over and lifted Silvio, just as she had done on former occasions,
and held him in her arms, petting him and treating him as though he
were a little child who had erred.

As I looked a strange fear came over me.  The Margaret that I knew
seemed to be changing; and in my inmost heart I prayed that the
disturbing cause might soon come to an end.  More than ever I longed at
that moment that our terrible Experiment should come to a prosperous
termination.

When all had been arranged in the room as Mr. Trelawny wished he turned
to us, one after another, till he had concentrated the intelligence of
us all upon him.  Then he said:

"All is now ready in this place.  We must only await the proper time to
begin."

We were silent for a while.  Doctor Winchester was the first to speak:

"What is the proper time?  Have you any approximation, even if you are
not satisfied as to the exact day?"  He answered at once:

"After the most anxious thought I have fixed on July 31!"

"May I ask why that date?"  He spoke his answer slowly:

"Queen Tera was ruled in great degree by mysticism, and there are so
many evidences that she looked for resurrection that naturally she
would choose a period ruled over by a God specialised to such a
purpose.  Now, the fourth month of the season of Inundation was ruled
by Harmachis, this being the name for 'Ra', the Sun-God, at his rising
in the morning, and therefore typifying the awakening or arising.  This
arising is manifestly to physical life, since it is of the mid-world of
human daily life.  Now as this month begins on our 25th July, the
seventh day would be July 31st, for you may be sure that the mystic
Queen would not have chosen any day but the seventh or some power of
seven.

"I dare say that some of you have wondered why our preparations have
been so deliberately undertaken.  This is why!  We must be ready in
every possible way when the time comes; but there was no use in having
to wait round for a needless number of days."

And so we waited only for the 31st of July, the next day but one, when
the Great Experiment would be made.




Chapter XVII

Doubts and Fears


We learn of great things by little experiences.  The history of ages is
but an indefinite repetition of the history of hours.  The record of a
soul is but a multiple of the story of a moment.  The Recording Angel
writes in the Great Book in no rainbow tints; his pen is dipped in no
colours but light and darkness.  For the eye of infinite wisdom there
is no need of shading.  All things, all thoughts, all emotions, all
experiences, all doubts and hopes and fears, all intentions, all wishes
seen down to the lower strata of their concrete and multitudinous
elements, are finally resolved into direct opposites.

Did any human being wish for the epitome of a life wherein were
gathered and grouped all the experiences that a child of Adam could
have, the history, fully and frankly written, of my own mind during the
next forty-eight hours would afford him all that could be wanted.  And
the Recorder could have wrought as usual in sunlight and shadow, which
may be taken to represent the final expressions of Heaven and Hell.
For in the highest Heaven is Faith; and Doubt hangs over the yawning
blackness of Hell.

There were of course times of sunshine in those two days; moments when,
in the realisation of Margaret's sweetness and her love for me, all
doubts were dissipated like morning mist before the sun.  But the
balance of the time--and an overwhelming balance it was--gloom hung
over me like a pall.  The hour, in whose coming I had acquiesced, was
approaching so quickly and was already so near that the sense of
finality was bearing upon me!  The issue was perhaps life or death to
any of us; but for this we were all prepared.  Margaret and I were one
as to the risk.  The question of the moral aspect of the case, which
involved the religious belief in which I had been reared, was not one
to trouble me; for the issues, and the causes that lay behind them,
were not within my power even to comprehend.  The doubt of the success
of the Great Experiment was such a doubt as exists in all enterprises
which have great possibilities.  To me, whose life was passed in a
series of intellectual struggles, this form of doubt was a stimulus,
rather than deterrent.  What then was it that made for me a trouble,
which became an anguish when my thoughts dwelt long on it?

I was beginning to doubt Margaret!

What it was that I doubted I knew not.  It was not her love, or her
honour, or her truth, or her kindness, or her zeal.  What then was it?

It was herself!

Margaret was changing!  At times during the past few days I had hardly
known her as the same girl whom I had met at the picnic, and whose
vigils I had shared in the sick-room of her father.  Then, even in her
moments of greatest sorrow or fright or anxiety, she was all life and
thought and keenness.  Now she was generally distraite, and at times in
a sort of negative condition as though her mind--her very being--was
not present.  At such moments she would have full possession of
observation and memory.  She would know and remember all that was going
on, and had gone on around her; but her coming back to her old self had
to me something the sensation of a new person coming into the room.  Up
to the time of leaving London I had been content whenever she was
present.  I had over me that delicious sense of security which comes
with the consciousness that love is mutual.  But now doubt had taken
its place. I never knew whether the personality present was my
Margaret--the old Margaret whom I had loved at the first glance--or the
other new Margaret, whom I hardly understood, and whose intellectual
aloofness made an impalpable barrier between us.  Sometimes she would
become, as it were, awake all at once. At such times, though she would
say to me sweet and pleasant things which she had often said before,
she would seem most unlike herself.  It was almost as if she was
speaking parrot-like or at dictation of one who could read words or
acts, but not thoughts.  After one or two experiences of this kind, my
own doubting began to make a barrier; for I could not speak with the
ease and freedom which were usual to me.  And so hour by hour we
drifted apart.  Were it not for the few odd moments when the old
Margaret was back with me full of her charm I do not know what would
have happened.  As it was, each such moment gave me a fresh start and
kept my love from changing.

I would have given the world for a confidant; but this was impossible.
How could I speak a doubt of Margaret to anyone, even her father!  How
could I speak a doubt to Margaret, when Margaret herself was the theme!
I could only endure--and hope. And of the two the endurance was the
lesser pain.

I think that Margaret must have at times felt that there was some cloud
between us, for towards the end of the first day she began to shun me a
little; or perhaps it was that she had become more diffident that usual
about me.  Hitherto she had sought every opportunity of being with me,
just as I had tried to be with her; so that now any avoidance, one of
the other, made a new pain to us both.

On this day the household seemed very still.  Each one of us was about
his own work, or occupied with his own thoughts.  We only met at meal
times; and then, though we talked, all seemed more or less preoccupied.
There was not in the house even the stir of the routine of service.
The precaution of Mr. Trelawny in having three rooms prepared for each
of us had rendered servants unnecessary.  The dining-room was solidly
prepared with cooked provisions for several days.  Towards evening I
went out by myself for a stroll.  I had looked for Margaret to ask her
to come with me; but when I found her, she was in one of her apathetic
moods, and the charm of her presence seemed lost to me.  Angry with
myself, but unable to quell my own spirit of discontent, I went out
alone over the rocky headland.

On the cliff, with the wide expanse of wonderful sea before me, and no
sound but the dash of waves below and the harsh screams of the seagulls
above, my thoughts ran free.  Do what I would, they returned
continuously to one subject, the solving of the doubt that was upon me.
Here in the solitude, amid the wide circle of Nature's force and
strife, my mind began to work truly.  Unconsciously I found myself
asking a question which I would not allow myself to answer.  At last
the persistence of a mind working truly prevailed; I found myself face
to face with my doubt.  The habit of my life began to assert itself,
and I analysed the evidence before me.

It was so startling that I had to force myself into obedience to
logical effort.  My starting-place was this:  Margaret was changed--in
what way, and by what means? Was it her character, or her mind, or her
nature? for her physical appearance remained the same.  I began to
group all that I had ever heard of her, beginning at her birth.

It was strange at the very first.  She had been, according to Corbeck's
statement, born of a dead mother during the time that her father and
his friend were in a trance in the tomb at Aswan.  That trance was
presumably effected by a woman; a woman mummied, yet preserving as we
had every reason to believe from after experience, an astral body
subject to a free will and an active intelligence.  With that astral
body, space ceased to exist.  The vast distance between London and
Aswan became as naught; and whatever power of necromancy the Sorceress
had might have been exercised over the dead mother, and possibly the
dead child.

The dead child!  Was it possible that the child was dead and was made
alive again? Whence then came the animating spirit--the soul?  Logic
was pointing the way to me now with a vengeance!

If the Egyptian belief was true for Egyptians, then the "Ka" of the
dead Queen and her "Khu" could animate what she might choose.  In such
case Margaret would not be an individual at all, but simply a phase of
Queen Tera herself; an astral body obedient to her will!

Here I revolted against logic.  Every fibre of my being resented such a
conclusion. How could I believe that there was no Margaret at all; but
just an animated image, used by the Double of a woman of forty
centuries ago to its own ends...! Somehow, the outlook was brighter to
me now, despite the new doubts.

At least I had Margaret!

Back swung the logical pendulum again.  The child then was not dead.
If so, had the Sorceress had anything to do with her birth at all?  It
was evident--so I took it again from Corbeck--that there was a strange
likeness between Margaret and the pictures of Queen Tera.  How could
this be?  It could not be any birth-mark reproducing what had been in
the mother's mind; for Mrs. Trelawny had never seen the pictures.  Nay,
even her father had not seen them till he had found his way into the
tomb only a few days before her birth.  This phase I could not get rid
of so easily as the last; the fibres of my being remained quiet.  There
remained to me the horror of doubt.  And even then, so strange is the
mind of man, Doubt itself took a concrete image; a vast and
impenetrable gloom, through which flickered irregularly and
spasmodically tiny points of evanescent light, which seemed to quicken
the darkness into a positive existence.

The remaining possibility of relations between Margaret and the mummied
Queen was, that in some occult way the Sorceress had power to change
places with the other.  This view of things could not be so lightly
thrown aside.  There were too many suspicious circumstances to warrant
this, now that my attention was fixed on it and my intelligence
recognised the possibility.  Hereupon there began to come into my mind
all the strange incomprehensible matters which had whirled through our
lives in the last few days.  At first they all crowded in upon me in a
jumbled mass; but again the habit of mind of my working life prevailed,
and they took order.  I found it now easier to control myself; for
there was something to grasp, some work to be done; though it was of a
sorry kind, for it was or might be antagonistic to Margaret.  But
Margaret was herself at stake!  I was thinking of her and fighting for
her; and yet if I were to work in the dark, I might be even harmful to
her.  My first weapon in her defence was truth.  I must know and
understand; I might then be able to act.  Certainly, I could not act
beneficently without a just conception and recognition of the facts.
Arranged in order these were as follows:

Firstly:  the strange likeness of Queen Tera to Margaret who had been
born in another country a thousand miles away, where her mother could
not possibly have had even a passing knowledge of her appearance.

Secondly:  the disappearance of Van Huyn's book when I had read up to
the description of the Star Ruby.

Thirdly:  the finding of the lamps in the boudoir.  Tera with her
astral body could have unlocked the door of Corbeck's room in the
hotel, and have locked it again after her exit with the lamps.  She
could in the same way have opened the window, and put the lamps in the
boudoir.  It need not have been that Margaret in her own person should
have had any hand in this; but--but it was at least strange.

Fourthly:  here the suspicions of the Detective and the Doctor came
back to me with renewed force, and with a larger understanding.

Fifthly:  there were the occasions on which Margaret foretold with
accuracy the coming occasions of quietude, as though she had some
conviction or knowledge of the intentions of the astral-bodied Queen.

Sixthly:  there was her suggestion of the finding of the Ruby which her
father had lost.  As I thought now afresh over this episode in the
light of suspicion in which her own powers were involved, the only
conclusion I could come to was--always supposing that the theory of the
Queen's astral power was correct--that Queen Tera being anxious that
all should go well in the movement from London to Kyllion had in her
own way taken the Jewel from Mr. Trelawny's pocket-book, finding it of
some use in her supernatural guardianship of the journey.  Then in some
mysterious way she had, through Margaret, made the suggestion of its
loss and finding.

Seventhly, and lastly, was the strange dual existence which Margaret
seemed of late to be leading; and which in some way seemed a
consequence or corollary of all that had gone before.

The dual existence!  This was indeed the conclusion which overcame all
difficulties and reconciled opposites.  If indeed Margaret were not in
all ways a free agent, but could be compelled to speak or act as she
might be instructed; or if her whole being could be changed for another
without the possibility of any one noticing the doing of it, then all
things were possible.  All would depend on the spirit of the
individuality by which she could be so compelled.  If this
individuality were just and kind and clean, all might be well.  But if
not! ... The thought was too awful for words.  I ground my teeth with
futile rage, as the ideas of horrible possibilities swept through me.

Up to this morning Margaret's lapses into her new self had been few and
hardly noticeable, save when once or twice her attitude towards myself
had been marked by a bearing strange to me.  But today the contrary was
the case; and the change presaged badly.  It might be that that other
individuality was of the lower, not of the better sort!  Now that I
thought of it I had reason to fear.  In the history of the mummy, from
the time of Van Huyn's breaking into the tomb, the record of deaths
that we knew of, presumably effected by her will and agency, was a
startling one. The Arab who had stolen the hand from the mummy; and the
one who had taken it from his body.  The Arab chief who had tried to
steal the Jewel from Van Huyn, and whose throat bore the marks of seven
fingers. The two men found dead on the first night of Trelawny's taking
away the sarcophagus; and the three on the return to the tomb.  The
Arab who had opened the secret serdab.  Nine dead men, one of them
slain manifestly by the Queen's own hand!  And beyond this again the
several savage attacks on Mr. Trelawny in his own room, in which, aided
by her Familiar, she had tried to open the safe and to extract the
Talisman jewel.  His device of fastening the key to his wrist by a
steel bangle, though successful in the end, had wellnigh cost him his
life.

If then the Queen, intent on her resurrection under her own conditions
had, so to speak, waded to it through blood, what might she not do were
her purpose thwarted?  What terrible step might she not take to effect
her wishes?  Nay, what were her wishes; what was her ultimate purpose?
As yet we had had only Margaret's statement of them, given in all the
glorious enthusiasm of her lofty soul.  In her record there was no
expression of love to be sought or found.  All we knew for certain was
that she had set before her the object of resurrection, and that in it
the North which she had manifestly loved was to have a special part.
But that the resurrection was to be accomplished in the lonely tomb in
the Valley of the Sorcerer was apparent.  All preparations had been
carefully made for accomplishment from within, and for her ultimate
exit in her new and living form. The sarcophagus was unlidded.  The oil
jars, though hermetically sealed, were to be easily opened by hand; and
in them provision was made for shrinkage through a vast period of time.
Even flint and steel were provided for the production of flame.  The
Mummy Pit was left open in violation of usage; and beside the stone
door on the cliff side was fixed an imperishable chain by which she
might in safety descend to earth. But as to what her after intentions
were we had no clue.  If it was that she meant to begin life again as a
humble individual, there was something so noble in the thought that it
even warmed my heart to her and turned my wishes to her success.

The very idea seemed to endorse Margaret's magnificent tribute to her
purpose, and helped to calm my troubled spirit.

Then and there, with this feeling strong upon me, I determined to warn
Margaret and her father of dire possibilities; and to await, as well
content as I could in my ignorance, the development of things over
which I had no power.

I returned to the house in a different frame of mind to that in which I
had left it; and was enchanted to find Margaret--the old
Margaret--waiting for me.

After dinner, when I was alone for a time with the father and daughter,
I opened the subject, though with considerable hesitation:

"Would it not be well to take every possible precaution, in case the
Queen may not wish what we are doing, with regard to what may occur
before the Experiment; and at or after her waking, if it comes off?"
Margaret's answer came back quickly; so quickly that I was convinced
she must have had it ready for some one:

"But she does approve!  Surely it cannot be otherwise.  Father is
doing, with all his brains and all his energy and all his great
courage, just exactly what the great Queen had arranged!"

"But," I answered, "that can hardly be.  All that she arranged was in a
tomb high up in a rock, in a desert solitude, shut away from the world
by every conceivable means. She seems to have depended on this
isolation to insure against accident.  Surely, here in another country
and age, with quite different conditions, she may in her anxiety make
mistakes and treat any of you--of us--as she did those others in times
gone past. Nine men that we know of have been slain by her own hand or
by her instigation.  She can be remorseless if she will."  It did not
strike me till afterwards when I was thinking over this conversation,
how thoroughly I had accepted the living and conscious condition of
Queen Tera as a fact.  Before I spoke, I had feared I might offend Mr.
Trelawny; but to my pleasant surprise he smiled quite genially as he
answered me:

"My dear fellow, in a way you are quite right.  The Queen did
undoubtedly intend isolation; and, all told, it would be best that her
experiment should be made as she arranged it.  But just think, that
became impossible when once the Dutch explorer had broken into her
tomb. That was not my doing.  I am innocent of it, though it was the
cause of my setting out to rediscover the sepulchre.  Mind, I do not
say for a moment that I would not have done just the same as Van Huyn.
I went into the tomb from curiosity; and I took away what I did, being
fired with the zeal of acquisitiveness which animates the collector.
But, remember also, that at this time I did not know of the Queen's
intention of resurrection; I had no idea of the completeness of her
preparations. All that came long afterwards.  But when it did come, I
have done all that I could to carry out her wishes to the full.  My
only fear is that I may have misinterpreted some of her cryptic
instructions, or have omitted or overlooked something.  But of this I
am certain; I have left undone nothing that I can imagine right to be
done; and I have done nothing that I know of to clash with Queen Tera's
arrangement.  I want her Great Experiment to succeed.  To this end I
have not spared labour or time or money--or myself.  I have endured
hardship, and braved danger. All my brains; all my knowledge and
learning, such as they are; all my endeavours such as they can be, have
been, are, and shall be devoted to this end, till we either win or lose
the great stake that we play for."

"The great stake?" I repeated; "the resurrection of the woman, and the
woman's life? The proof that resurrection can be accomplished; by
magical powers; by scientific knowledge; or by use of some force which
at present the world does not know?"

Then Mr. Trelawny spoke out the hopes of his heart which up to now he
had indicated rather than expressed.  Once or twice I had heard Corbeck
speak of the fiery energy of his youth; but, save for the noble words
of Margaret when she had spoken of Queen Tera's hope--which coming from
his daughter made possible a belief that her power was in some sense
due to heredity--I had seen no marked sign of it.  But now his words,
sweeping before them like a torrent all antagonistic thought, gave me a
new idea of the man.

"'A woman's life!'  What is a woman's life in the scale with what we
hope for!  Why, we are risking already a woman's life; the dearest life
to me in all the world, and that grows more dear with every hour that
passes.  We are risking as well the lives of four men; yours and my
own, as well as those two others who have been won to our confidence.
'The proof that resurrection can be accomplished!'  That is much.  A
marvellous thing in this age of science, and the scepticism that
knowledge makes. But life and resurrection are themselves but items in
what may be won by the accomplishment of this Great Experiment.
Imagine what it will be for the world of thought--the true world of
human progress--the veritable road to the Stars, the itur ad astra of
the Ancients--if there can come back to us out of the unknown past one
who can yield to us the lore stored in the great Library of Alexandria,
and lost in its consuming flames.  Not only history can be set right,
and the teachings of science made veritable from their beginnings; but
we can be placed on the road to the knowledge of lost arts, lost
learning, lost sciences, so that our feet may tread on the indicated
path to their ultimate and complete restoration.  Why, this woman can
tell us what the world was like before what is called 'the Flood'; can
give us the origin of that vast astounding myth; can set the mind back
to the consideration of things which to us now seem primeval, but which
were old stories before the days of the Patriarchs.  But this is not
the end!  No, not even the beginning!  If the story of this woman be
all that we think--which some of us most firmly believe; if her powers
and the restoration of them prove to be what we expect, why, then we
may yet achieve a knowledge beyond what our age has ever known--beyond
what is believed today possible for the children of men.  If indeed
this resurrection can be accomplished, how can we doubt the old
knowledge, the old magic, the old belief! And if this be so, we must
take it that the 'Ka' of this great and learned Queen has won secrets
of more than mortal worth from her surroundings amongst the stars. This
woman in her life voluntarily went down living to the grave, and came
back again, as we learn from the records in her tomb; she chose to die
her mortal death whilst young, so that at her resurrection in another
age, beyond a trance of countless magnitude, she might emerge from her
tomb in all the fulness and splendour of her youth and power.  Already
we have evidence that though her body slept in patience through those
many centuries, her intelligence never passed away, that her resolution
never flagged, that her will remained supreme; and, most important of
all, that her memory was unimpaired.  Oh, what possibilities are there
in the coming of such a being into our midst!  One whose history began
before the concrete teaching of our Bible; whose experiences were
antecedent to the formulation of the Gods of Greece; who can link
together the Old and the New, Earth and Heaven, and yield to the known
worlds of thought and physical existence the mystery of the Unknown--of
the Old World in its youth, and of Worlds beyond our ken!"

He paused, almost overcome.  Margaret had taken his hand when he spoke
of her being so dear to him, and held it hard.  As he spoke she
continued to hold it.  But there came over her face that change which I
had so often seen of late; that mysterious veiling of her own
personality which gave me the subtle sense of separation from her.  In
his impassioned vehemence her father did not notice; but when he
stopped she seemed all at once to be herself again.  In her glorious
eyes came the added brightness of unshed tears; and with a gesture of
passionate love and admiration, she stooped and kissed her father's
hand.  Then, turning to me, she too spoke:

"Malcolm, you have spoken of the deaths that came from the poor Queen;
or rather that justly came from meddling with her arrangements and
thwarting her purpose. Do you not think that, in putting it as you have
done, you have been unjust?  Who would not have done just as she did?
Remember she was fighting for her life!  Ay, and for more than her
life! For life, and love, and all the glorious possibilities of that
dim future in the unknown world of the North which had such enchanting
hopes for her!  Do you not think that she, with all the learning of her
time, and with all the great and resistless force of her mighty nature,
had hopes of spreading in a wider way the lofty aspirations of her
soul! That she hoped to bring to the conquering of unknown worlds, and
using to the advantage of her people, all that she had won from sleep
and death and time; all of which might and could have been frustrated
by the ruthless hand of an assassin or a thief.  Were it you, in such
case would you not struggle by all means to achieve the object of your
life and hope; whose possibilities grew and grew in the passing of
those endless years?  Can you think that that active brain was at rest
during all those weary centuries, whilst her free soul was flitting
from world to world amongst the boundless regions of the stars? Had
these stars in their myriad and varied life no lessons for her; as they
have had for us since we followed the glorious path which she and her
people marked for us, when they sent their winged imaginations circling
amongst the lamps of the night!"

Here she paused.  She too was overcome, and the welling tears ran down
her cheeks. I was myself more moved than I can say.  This was indeed my
Margaret; and in the consciousness of her presence my heart leapt.  Out
of my happiness came boldness, and I dared to say now what I had feared
would be impossible:  something which would call the attention of Mr.
Trelawny to what I imagined was the dual existence of his daughter.  As
I took Margaret's hand in mine and kissed it, I said to her father:

"Why, sir! she couldn't speak more eloquently if the very spirit of
Queen Tera was with her to animate her and suggest thoughts!"

Mr. Trelawny's answer simply overwhelmed me with surprise.  It
manifested to me that he too had gone through just such a process of
thought as my own.

"And what if it was; if it is!  I know well that the spirit of her
mother is within her.  If in addition there be the spirit of that great
and wondrous Queen, then she would be no less dear to me, but doubly
dear!  Do not have fear for her, Malcolm Ross; at least have no more
fear than you may have for the rest of us!"  Margaret took up the
theme, speaking so quickly that her words seemed a continuation of her
father's, rather than an interruption of them.

"Have no special fear for me, Malcolm.  Queen Tera knows, and will
offer us no harm. I know it!  I know it, as surely as I am lost in the
depth of my own love for you!"

There was something in her voice so strange to me that I looked quickly
into her eyes.  They were bright as ever, but veiled to my seeing the
inward thought behind them as are the eyes of a caged lion.

Then the two other men came in, and the subject changed.




Chapter XVIII

The Lesson of the "Ka"


That night we all went to bed early.  The next night would be an
anxious one, and Mr. Trelawny thought that we should all be fortified
with what sleep we could get. The day, too, would be full of work.
Everything in connection with the Great Experiment would have to be
gone over, so that at the last we might not fail from any unthought-of
flaw in our working. We made, of course, arrangements for summoning aid
in case such should be needed; but I do not think that any of us had
any real apprehension of danger.  Certainly we had no fear of such
danger from violence as we had had to guard against in London during
Mr. Trelawny's long trance.

For my own part I felt a strange sense of relief in the matter.  I had
accepted Mr. Trelawny's reasoning that if the Queen were indeed such as
we surmised--such as indeed we now took for granted--there would not be
any opposition on her part; for we were carrying out her own wishes to
the very last.  So far I was at ease--far more at ease than earlier in
the day I should have thought possible; but there were other sources of
trouble which I could not blot out from my mind.  Chief amongst them
was Margaret's strange condition.  If it was indeed that she had in her
own person a dual existence, what might happen when the two existences
became one? Again, and again, and again I turned this matter over in my
mind, till I could have shrieked out in nervous anxiety.  It was no
consolation to me to remember that Margaret was herself satisfied, and
her father acquiescent.  Love is, after all, a selfish thing; and it
throws a black shadow on anything between which and the light it
stands. I seemed to hear the hands go round the dial of the clock; I
saw darkness turn to gloom, and gloom to grey, and grey to light
without pause or hindrance to the succession of my miserable feelings.
At last, when it was decently possible without the fear of disturbing
others, I got up.  I crept along the passage to find if all was well
with the others; for we had arranged that the door of each of our rooms
should be left slightly open so that any sound of disturbance would be
easily and distinctly heard.

One and all slept; I could hear the regular breathing of each, and my
heart rejoiced that this miserable night of anxiety was safely passed.
As I knelt in my own room in a burst of thankful prayer, I knew in the
depths of my own heart the measure of my fear.  I found my way out of
the house, and went down to the water by the long stairway cut in the
rock.  A swim in the cool bright sea braced my nerves and made me my
old self again.

As I came back to the top of the steps I could see the bright sunlight,
rising from behind me, turning the rocks across the bay to glittering
gold.  And yet I felt somehow disturbed.  It was all too bright; as it
sometimes is before the coming of a storm.  As I paused to watch it, I
felt a soft hand on my shoulder; and, turning, found Margaret close to
me; Margaret as bright and radiant as the morning glory of the sun! It
was my own Margaret this time!  My old Margaret, without alloy of any
other; and I felt that, at least, this last and fatal day was well
begun.

But alas! the joy did not last.  When we got back to the house from a
stroll around the cliffs, the same old routine of yesterday was
resumed: gloom and anxiety, hope, high spirits, deep depression, and
apathetic aloofness.

But it was to be a day of work; and we all braced ourselves to it with
an energy which wrought its own salvation.

After breakfast we all adjourned to the cave, where Mr. Trelawny went
over, point by point, the position of each item of our paraphernalia.
He explained as he went on why each piece was so placed.  He had with
him the great rolls of paper with the measured plans and the signs and
drawings which he had had made from his own and Corbeck's rough notes.
As he had told us, these contained the whole of the hieroglyphics on
walls and ceilings and floor of the tomb in the Valley of the Sorcerer.
Even had not the measurements, made to scale, recorded the position of
each piece of furniture, we could have eventually placed them by a
study of the cryptic writings and symbols.

Mr. Trelawny explained to us certain other things, not laid down on the
chart.  Such as, for instance, that the hollowed part of the table was
exactly fitted to the bottom of the Magic Coffer, which was therefore
intended to be placed on it.  The respective legs of this table were
indicated by differently shaped uraei outlined on the floor, the head
of each being extended in the direction of the similar uraeus twined
round the leg. Also that the mummy, when laid on the raised portion in
the bottom of the sarcophagus, seemingly made to fit the form, would
lie head to the West and feet to the East, thus receiving the natural
earth currents.  "If this be intended," he said, "as I presume it is, I
gather that the force to be used has something to do with magnetism or
electricity, or both.  It may be, of course, that some other force,
such, for instance, as that emanating from radium, is to be employed.
I have experimented with the latter, but only in such small quantity as
I could obtain; but so far as I can ascertain the stone of the Coffer
is absolutely impervious to its influence.  There must be some such
unsusceptible substances in nature.  Radium does not seemingly manifest
itself when distributed through pitchblende; and there are doubtless
other such substances in which it can be imprisoned.  Possibly these
may belong to that class of "inert" elements discovered or isolated by
Sir William Ramsay.  It is therefore possible that in this Coffer, made
from an aerolite and therefore perhaps containing some element unknown
in our world, may be imprisoned some mighty power which is to be
released on its opening."

This appeared to be an end of this branch of the subject; but as he
still kept the fixed look of one who is engaged in a theme we all
waited in silence.  After a pause he went on:

"There is one thing which has up to now, I confess, puzzled me.  It may
not be of prime importance; but in a matter like this, where all is
unknown, we must take it that everything is important.  I cannot think
that in a matter worked out with such extraordinary scrupulosity such a
thing should be overlooked.  As you may see by the ground-plan of the
tomb the sarcophagus stands near the north wall, with the Magic Coffer
to the south of it.  The space covered by the former is left quite bare
of symbol or ornamentation of any kind.  At the first glance this would
seem to imply that the drawings had been made after the sarcophagus had
been put into its place.  But a more minute examination will show that
the symbolisation on the floor is so arranged that a definite effect is
produced.  See, here the writings run in correct order as though they
had jumped across the gap.  It is only from certain effects that it
becomes clear that there is a meaning of some kind.  What that meaning
may be is what we want to know.  Look at the top and bottom of the
vacant space, which lies West and East corresponding to the head and
foot of the sarcophagus.  In both are duplications of the same
symbolisation, but so arranged that the parts of each one of them are
integral portions of some other writing running crosswise.  It is only
when we get a coup d'oeil from either the head or the foot that you
recognise that there are symbolisations.  See! they are in triplicate
at the corners and the centre of both top and bottom.  In every case
there is a sun cut in half by the line of the sarcophagus, as by the
horizon. Close behind each of these and faced away from it, as though
in some way dependent on it, is the vase which in hieroglyphic writing
symbolises the heart--'Ab' the Egyptians called it.  Beyond each of
these again is the figure of a pair of widespread arms turned upwards
from the elbow; this is the determinative of the 'Ka' or 'Double'.  But
its relative position is different at top and bottom.  At the head of
the sarcophagus the top of the 'Ka' is turned towards the mouth of the
vase, but at the foot the extended arms point away from it.

"The symbolisation seems to mean that during the passing of the Sun
from West to East--from sunset to sunrise, or through the Under World,
otherwise night--the Heart, which is material even in the tomb and
cannot leave it, simply revolves, so that it can always rest on 'Ra'
the Sun-God, the origin of all good; but that the Double, which
represents the active principle, goes whither it will, the same by
night as by day. If this be correct it is a warning--a caution--a
reminder that the consciousness of the mummy does not rest but is to be
reckoned with.

"Or it may be intended to convey that after the particular night of the
resurrection, the 'Ka' would leave the heart altogether, thus typifying
that in her resurrection the Queen would be restored to a lower and
purely physical existence.  In such case what would become of her
memory and the experiences of her wide-wandering soul?  The chiefest
value of her resurrection would be lost to the world!  This, however,
does not alarm me.  It is only guess-work after all, and is
contradictory to the intellectual belief of the Egyptian theology, that
the 'Ka' is an essential portion of humanity."  He paused and we all
waited.  The silence was broken by Doctor Winchester:

"But would not all this imply that the Queen feared intrusion of her
tomb?"  Mr. Trelawny smiled as he answered:

"My dear sir, she was prepared for it.  The grave robber is no modern
application of endeavour; he was probably known in the Queen's own
dynasty.  Not only was she prepared for intrusion, but, as shown in
several ways, she expected it.  The hiding of the lamps in the serdab,
and the institution of the avenging 'treasurer' shows that there was
defence, positive as well as negative.  Indeed, from the many
indications afforded in the clues laid out with the most consummated
thought, we may almost gather that she entertained it as a possibility
that others--like ourselves, for instance--might in all seriousness
undertake the work which she had made ready for her own hands when the
time should have come.  This very matter that I have been speaking of
is an instance.  The clue is intended for seeing eyes!"

Again we were silent.  It was Margaret who spoke:

"Father, may I have that chart?  I should like to study it during the
day!"

"Certainly, my dear!" answered Mr. Trelawny heartily, as he handed it
to her.  He resumed his instructions in a different tone, a more
matter-of-fact one suitable to a practical theme which had no mystery
about it:

"I think you had better all understand the working of the electric
light in case any sudden contingency should arise.  I dare say you have
noticed that we have a complete supply in every part of the house, so
that there need not be a dark corner anywhere.  This I had specially
arranged.  It is worked by a set of turbines moved by the flowing and
ebbing tide, after the manner of the turbines at Niagara.  I hope by
this means to nullify accident and to have without fail a full supply
ready at any time. Come with me and I will explain the system of
circuits, and point out to you the taps and the fuses."  I could not
but notice, as we went with him all over the house, how absolutely
complete the system was, and how he had guarded himself against any
disaster that human thought could foresee.

But out of the very completeness came a fear!  In such an enterprise as
ours the bounds of human thought were but narrow.  Beyond it lay the
vast of Divine wisdom, and Divine power!

When we came back to the cave, Mr. Trelawny took up another theme:

"We have now to settle definitely the exact hour at which the Great
Experiment is to be made.  So far as science and mechanism go, if the
preparations are complete, all hours are the same.  But as we have to
deal with preparations made by a woman of extraordinarily subtle mind,
and who had full belief in magic and had a cryptic meaning in
everything, we should place ourselves in her position before deciding.
It is now manifest that the sunset has an important place in the
arrangements.  As those suns, cut so mathematically by the edge of the
sarcophagus, were arranged of full design, we must take our cue from
this.  Again, we find all along that the number seven has had an
important bearing on every phase of the Queen's thought and reasoning
and action.  The logical result is that the seventh hour after sunset
was the time fixed on.  This is borne out by the fact that on each of
the occasions when action was taken in my house, this was the time
chosen.  As the sun sets tonight in Cornwall at eight, our hour is to
be three in the morning!"  He spoke in a matter-of-fact way, though
with great gravity; but there was nothing of mystery in his word or
manner.  Still, we were all impressed to a remarkable degree.  I could
see this in the other men by the pallor that came on some of their
faces, and by the stillness and unquestioning silence with which the
decision was received.  The only one who remained in any way at ease
was Margaret, who had lapsed into one of her moods of abstraction, but
who seemed to wake up to a note of gladness.  Her father, who was
watching her intently, smiled; her mood was to him a direct
confirmation of his theory.

For myself I was almost overcome.  The definite fixing of the hour
seemed like the voice of Doom.  When I think of it now, I can realise
how a condemned man feels at his sentence, or at the sounding of the
last hour he is to hear.

There could be no going back now!  We were in the hands of God!

The hands of God...!  And yet...!  What other forces were arrayed? ...
What would become of us all, poor atoms of earthly dust whirled in the
wind which cometh whence and goeth whither no man may know.  It was not
for myself... Margaret...!

I was recalled by Mr. Trelawny's firm voice:

"Now we shall see to the lamps and finish our preparations."
Accordingly we set to work, and under his supervision made ready the
Egyptian lamps, seeing that they were well filled with the cedar oil,
and that the wicks were adjusted and in good order.  We lighted and
tested them one by one, and left them ready so that they would light at
once and evenly.  When this was done we had a general look round; and
fixed all in readiness for our work at night.

All this had taken time, and we were I think all surprised when as we
emerged from the cave we heard the great clock in the hall chime four.

We had a late lunch, a thing possible without trouble in the present
state of our commissariat arrangements.  After it, by Mr. Trelawny's
advice, we separated; each to prepare in our own way for the strain of
the coming night.  Margaret looked pale and somewhat overwrought, so I
advised her to lie down and try to sleep.  She promised that she would.
The abstraction which had been upon her fitfully all day lifted for the
time; with all her old sweetness and loving delicacy she kissed me
good-bye for the present!  With the sense of happiness which this gave
me I went out for a walk on the cliffs.  I did not want to think; and I
had an instinctive feeling that fresh air and God's sunlight, and the
myriad beauties of the works of His hand would be the best preparation
of fortitude for what was to come.

When I got back, all the party were assembling for a late tea.  Coming
fresh from the exhilaration of nature, it struck me as almost comic
that we, who were nearing the end of so strange--almost monstrous--an
undertaking, should be yet bound by the needs and habits of our lives.

All the men of the party were grave; the time of seclusion, even if it
had given them rest, had also given opportunity for thought.  Margaret
was bright, almost buoyant; but I missed about her something of her
usual spontaneity.  Towards myself there was a shadowy air of reserve,
which brought back something of my suspicion.  When tea was over, she
went out of the room; but returned in a minute with the roll of drawing
which she had taken with her earlier in the day.  Coming close to Mr.
Trelawny, she said:

"Father, I have been carefully considering what you said today about
the hidden meaning of those suns and hearts and 'Ka's', and I have been
examining the drawings again."

"And with what result, my child?" asked Mr. Trelawny eagerly.

"There is another reading possible!"

"And that?"  His voice was now tremulous with anxiety.  Margaret spoke
with a strange ring in her voice; a ring that cannot be, unless there
is the consciousness of truth behind it:

"It means that at the sunset the 'Ka' is to enter the 'Ab'; and it is
only at the sunrise that it will leave it!"

"Go on!" said her father hoarsely.

"It means that for this night the Queen's Double, which is otherwise
free, will remain in her heart, which is mortal and cannot leave its
prison-place in the mummy-shrouding.  It means that when the sun has
dropped into the sea, Queen Tera will cease to exist as a conscious
power, till sunrise; unless the Great Experiment can recall her to
waking life.  It means that there will be nothing whatever for you or
others to fear from her in such way as we have all cause to remember.
Whatever change may come from the working of the Great Experiment,
there can come none from the poor, helpless, dead woman who has waited
all those centuries for this night; who has given up to the coming hour
all the freedom of eternity, won in the old way, in hope of a new life
in a new world such as she longed for...!"  She stopped suddenly.  As
she had gone on speaking there had come with her words a strange
pathetic, almost pleading, tone which touched me to the quick.  As she
stopped, I could see, before she turned away her head, that her eyes
were full of tears.

For once the heart of her father did not respond to her feeling.  He
looked exultant, but with a grim masterfulness which reminded me of the
set look of his stern face as he had lain in the trance.  He did not
offer any consolation to his daughter in her sympathetic pain.  He only
said:

"We may test the accuracy of your surmise, and of her feeling, when the
time comes!" Having said so, he went up the stone stairway and into his
own room.  Margaret's face had a troubled look as she gazed after him.

Strangely enough her trouble did not as usual touch me to the quick.

When Mr. Trelawny had gone, silence reigned.  I do not think that any
of us wanted to talk.  Presently Margaret went to her room, and I went
out on the terrace over the sea.  The fresh air and the beauty of all
before helped to restore the good spirits which I had known earlier in
the day. Presently I felt myself actually rejoicing in the belief that
the danger which I had feared from the Queen's violence on the coming
night was obviated.  I believed in Margaret's belief so thoroughly that
it did not occur to me to dispute her reasoning.  In a lofty frame of
mind, and with less anxiety than I had felt for days, I went to my room
and lay down on the sofa.

I was awaked by Corbeck calling to me, hurriedly:

"Come down to the cave as quickly as you can.  Mr. Trelawny wants to
see us all there at once.  Hurry!"

I jumped up and ran down to the cave.  All were there except Margaret,
who came immediately after me carrying Silvio in her arms.  When the
cat saw his old enemy he struggled to get down; but Margaret held him
fast and soothed him.  I looked at my watch.  It was close to eight.

When Margaret was with us her father said directly, with a quiet
insistence which was new to me:

"You believe, Margaret, that Queen Tera has voluntarily undertaken to
give up her freedom for this night?  To become a mummy and nothing
more, till the Experiment has been completed?  To be content that she
shall be powerless under all and any circumstances until after all is
over and the act of resurrection has been accomplished, or the effort
has failed?"  After a pause Margaret answered in a low voice:

"Yes!"

In the pause her whole being, appearance, expression, voice, manner had
changed. Even Silvio noticed it, and with a violent effort wriggled
away from her arms; she did not seem to notice the act.  I expected
that the cat, when he had achieved his freedom, would have attacked the
mummy; but on this occasion he did not.  He seemed too cowed to
approach it. He shrunk away, and with a piteous "miaou" came over and
rubbed himself against my ankles.  I took him up in my arms, and he
nestled there content.  Mr. Trelawny spoke again:

"You are sure of what you say!  You believe it with all your soul?"
Margaret's face had lost the abstracted look; it now seemed illuminated
with the devotion of one to whom is given to speak of great things.
She answered in a voice which, though quiet, vibrated with conviction:

"I know it!  My knowledge is beyond belief!"  Mr. Trelawny spoke again:

"Then you are so sure, that were you Queen Tera herself, you would be
willing to prove it in any way that I might suggest?"

"Yes, any way!" the answer rang out fearlessly.  He spoke again, in a
voice in which was no note of doubt:

"Even in the abandonment of your Familiar to death--to annihilation."

She paused, and I could see that she suffered--suffered horribly.
There was in her eyes a hunted look, which no man can, unmoved, see in
the eyes of his beloved.  I was about to interrupt, when her father's
eyes, glancing round with a fierce determination, met mine.  I stood
silent, almost spellbound; so also the other men. Something was going
on before us which we did not understand!

With a few long strides Mr. Trelawny went to the west side of the cave
and tore back the shutter which obscured the window.  The cool air blew
in, and the sunlight streamed over them both, for Margaret was now by
his side.  He pointed to where the sun was sinking into the sea in a
halo of golden fire, and his face was as set as flint.  In a voice
whose absolute uncompromising hardness I shall hear in my ears at times
till my dying day, he said:

"Choose!  Speak!  When the sun has dipped below the sea, it will be too
late!"  The glory of the dying sun seemed to light up Margaret's face,
till it shone as if lit from within by a noble light, as she answered:

"Even that!"

Then stepping over to where the mummy cat stood on the little table,
she placed her hand on it.  She had now left the sunlight, and the
shadows looked dark and deep over her.  In a clear voice she said:

"Were I Tera, I would say 'Take all I have!  This night is for the Gods
alone!'"

As she spoke the sun dipped, and the cold shadow suddenly fell on us.
We all stood still for a while.  Silvio jumped from my arms and ran
over to his mistress, rearing himself up against her dress as if asking
to be lifted.  He took no notice whatever of the mummy now.

Margaret was glorious with all her wonted sweetness as she said sadly:

"The sun is down, Father!  Shall any of us see it again?  The night of
nights is come!"




Chapter XIX

The Great Experiment


If any evidence had been wanted of how absolutely one and all of us had
come to believe in the spiritual existence of the Egyptian Queen, it
would have been found in the change which in a few minutes had been
effected in us by the statement of voluntary negation made, we all
believed, through Margaret.  Despite the coming of the fearful ordeal,
the sense of which it was impossible to forget, we looked and acted as
though a great relief had come to us.  We had indeed lived in such a
state of terrorism during the days when Mr. Trelawny was lying in a
trance that the feeling had bitten deeply into us.  No one knows till
he has experienced it, what it is to be in constant dread of some
unknown danger which may come at any time and in any form.

The change was manifested in different ways, according to each nature.
Margaret was sad.  Doctor Winchester was in high spirits, and keenly
observant; the process of thought which had served as an antidote to
fear, being now relieved from this duty, added to his intellectual
enthusiasm.  Mr. Corbeck seemed to be in a retrospective rather than a
speculative mood.  I was myself rather inclined to be gay; the relief
from certain anxiety regarding Margaret was sufficient for me for the
time.

As to Mr. Trelawny he seemed less changed than any.  Perhaps this was
only natural, as he had had in his mind the intention for so many years
of doing that in which we were tonight engaged, that any event
connected with it could only seem to him as an episode, a step to the
end.  His was that commanding nature which looks so to the end of an
undertaking that all else is of secondary importance.  Even now, though
his terrible sternness relaxed under the relief from the strain, he
never flagged nor faltered for a moment in his purpose.  He asked us
men to come with him; and going to the hall we presently managed to
lower into the cave an oak table, fairly long and not too wide, which
stood against the wall in the hall.  This we placed under the strong
cluster of electric lights in the middle of the cave.  Margaret looked
on for a while; then all at once her face blanched, and in an agitated
voice she said:

"What are you going to do, Father?"

"To unroll the mummy of the cat!  Queen Tera will not need her Familiar
tonight.  If she should want him, it might be dangerous to us; so we
shall make him safe.  You are not alarmed, dear?"

"Oh no!" she answered quickly.  "But I was thinking of my Silvio, and
how I should feel if he had been the mummy that was to be unswathed!"

Mr. Trelawny got knives and scissors ready, and placed the cat on the
table.  It was a grim beginning to our work; and it made my heart sink
when I thought of what might happen in that lonely house in the
mid-gloom of the night.  The sense of loneliness and isolation from the
world was increased by the moaning of the wind which had now risen
ominously, and by the beating of waves on the rocks below.  But we had
too grave a task before us to be swayed by external manifestations:
the unrolling of the mummy began.

There was an incredible number of bandages; and the tearing sound--they
being stuck fast to each other by bitumen and gums and spices--and the
little cloud of red pungent dust that arose, pressed on the senses of
all of us.  As the last wrappings came away, we saw the animal seated
before us.  He was all hunkered up; his hair and teeth and claws were
complete.  The eyes were closed, but the eyelids had not the fierce
look which I expected.  The whiskers had been pressed down on the side
of the face by the bandaging; but when the pressure was taken away they
stood out, just as they would have done in life.  He was a magnificent
creature, a tiger-cat of great size.  But as we looked at him, our
first glance of admiration changed to one of fear, and a shudder ran
through each one of us; for here was a confirmation of the fears which
we had endured.

His mouth and his claws were smeared with the dry, red stains of recent
blood!

Doctor Winchester was the first to recover; blood in itself had small
disturbing quality for him.  He had taken out his magnifying-glass and
was examining the stains on the cat's mouth.  Mr. Trelawny breathed
loudly, as though a strain had been taken from him.

"It is as I expected," he said.  "This promises well for what is to
follow."

By this time Doctor Winchester was looking at the red stained paws.
"As I expected!" he said.  "He has seven claws, too!"  Opening his
pocket-book, he took out the piece of blotting-paper marked by Silvio's
claws, on which was also marked in pencil a diagram of the cuts made on
Mr. Trelawny's wrist.  He placed the paper under the mummy cat's paw.
The marks fitted exactly.

When we had carefully examined the cat, finding, however, nothing
strange about it but its wonderful preservation, Mr. Trelawny lifted it
from the table.  Margaret started forward, crying out:

"Take care, Father!  Take care!  He may injure you!"

"Not now, my dear!" he answered as he moved towards the stairway.  Her
face fell. "Where are you going?" she asked in a faint voice.

"To the kitchen," he answered.  "Fire will take away all danger for the
future; even an astral body cannot materialise from ashes!"  He signed
to us to follow him.  Margaret turned away with a sob.  I went to her;
but she motioned me back and whispered:

"No, no!  Go with the others.  Father may want you.  Oh! it seems like
murder!  The poor Queen's pet...!"  The tears were dropping from under
the fingers that covered her eyes.

In the kitchen was a fire of wood ready laid.  To this Mr. Trelawny
applied a match; in a few seconds the kindling had caught and the
flames leaped.  When the fire was solidly ablaze, he threw the body of
the cat into it.  For a few seconds it lay a dark mass amidst the
flames, and the room was rank with the smell of burning hair.  Then the
dry body caught fire too.  The inflammable substances used in embalming
became new fuel, and the flames roared.  A few minutes of fierce
conflagration; and then we breathed freely.  Queen Tera's Familiar was
no more!

When we went back to the cave we found Margaret sitting in the dark.
She had switched off the electric light, and only a faint glow of the
evening light came through the narrow openings.  Her father went
quickly over to her and put his arms round her in a loving protective
way.  She laid her head on his shoulder for a minute and seemed
comforted. Presently she called to me:

"Malcolm, turn up the light!"  I carried out her orders, and could see
that, though she had been crying, her eyes were now dry.  Her father
saw it too and looked glad.  He said to us in a grave tone:

"Now we had better prepare for our great work.  It will not do to leave
anything to the last!"  Margaret must have had a suspicion of what was
coming, for it was with a sinking voice that she asked:

"What are you going to do now?"  Mr. Trelawny too must have had a
suspicion of her feelings, for he answered in a low tone:

"To unroll the mummy of Queen Tera!"  She came close to him and said
pleadingly in a whisper:

"Father, you are not going to unswathe her!  All you men...!  And in
the glare of light!"

"But why not, my dear?"

"Just think, Father, a woman!  All alone!  In such a way!  In such a
place!  Oh! it's cruel, cruel!"  She was manifestly much overcome.  Her
cheeks were flaming red, and her eyes were full of indignant tears.
Her father saw her distress; and, sympathising with it, began to
comfort her.  I was moving off; but he signed to me to stay.  I took it
that after the usual manner of men he wanted help on such an occasion,
and man-like wished to throw on someone else the task of dealing with a
woman in indignant distress.  However, he began to appeal first to her
reason:

"Not a woman, dear; a mummy!  She has been dead nearly five thousand
years!"

"What does that matter?  Sex is not a matter of years!  A woman is a
woman, if she had been dead five thousand centuries!  And you expect
her to arise out of that long sleep!  It could not be real death, if
she is to rise out of it!  You have led me to believe that she will
come alive when the Coffer is opened!"

"I did, my dear; and I believe it!  But if it isn't death that has been
the matter with her all these years, it is something uncommonly like
it. Then again, just think; it was men who embalmed her.  They didn't
have women's rights or lady doctors in ancient Egypt, my dear!  And
besides," he went on more freely, seeing that she was accepting his
argument, if not yielding to it, "we men are accustomed to such things.
Corbeck and I have unrolled a hundred mummies; and there were as many
women as men amongst them.  Doctor Winchester in his work has had to
deal with women as well of men, till custom has made him think nothing
of sex.  Even Ross has in his work as a barrister..."  He stopped
suddenly.

"You were going to help too!" she said to me, with an indignant look.

I said nothing; I thought silence was best.  Mr. Trelawny went on
hurriedly; I could see that he was glad of interruption, for the part
of his argument concerning a barrister's work was becoming decidedly
weak:

"My child, you will be with us yourself.  Would we do anything which
would hurt or offend you?  Come now! be reasonable!  We are not at a
pleasure party.  We are all grave men, entering gravely on an
experiment which may unfold the wisdom of old times, and enlarge human
knowledge indefinitely; which may put the minds of men on new tracks of
thought and research.  An experiment," as he went on his voice
deepened, "which may be fraught with death to any one of us--to us all!
We know from what has been, that there are, or may be, vast and unknown
dangers ahead of us, of which none in the house today may ever see the
end.  Take it, my child, that we are not acting lightly; but with all
the gravity of deeply earnest men!  Besides, my dear, whatever feelings
you or any of us may have on the subject, it is necessary for the
success of the experiment to unswathe her.  I think that under any
circumstances it would be necessary to remove the wrappings before she
became again a live human being instead of a spiritualised corpse with
an astral body. Were her original intention carried out, and did she
come to new life within her mummy wrappings, it might be to exchange a
coffin for a grave!  She would die the death of the buried alive!  But
now, when she has voluntarily abandoned for the time her astral power,
there can be no doubt on the subject."

Margaret's face cleared.  "All right, Father!" she said as she kissed
him.  "But oh! it seems a horrible indignity to a Queen, and a woman."

I was moving away to the staircase when she called me:

"Where are you going?"  I came back and took her hand and stroked it as
I answered:

"I shall come back when the unrolling is over!"  She looked at me long,
and a faint suggestion of a smile came over her face as she said:

"Perhaps you had better stay, too!  It may be useful to you in your
work as a barrister!"  She smiled out as she met my eyes:  but in an
instant she changed.  Her face grew grave, and deadly white.  In a far
away voice she said:

"Father is right!  It is a terrible occasion; we need all to be serious
over it.  But all the same--nay, for that very reason you had better
stay, Malcolm!  You may be glad, later on, that you were present
tonight!"

My heart sank down, down, at her words; but I thought it better to say
nothing.  Fear was stalking openly enough amongst us already!

By this time Mr. Trelawny, assisted by Mr. Corbeck and Doctor
Winchester, had raised the lid of the ironstone sarcophagus which
contained the mummy of the Queen.  It was a large one; but it was none
too big.  The mummy was both long and broad and high; and was of such
weight that it was no easy task, even for the four of us, to lift it
out.  Under Mr. Trelawny's direction we laid it out on the table
prepared for it.

Then, and then only, did the full horror of the whole thing burst upon
me!  There, in the full glare of the light, the whole material and
sordid side of death seemed staringly real.  The outer wrappings, torn
and loosened by rude touch, and with the colour either darkened by dust
or worn light by friction, seemed creased as by rough treatment; the
jagged edges of the wrapping-cloths looked fringed; the painting was
patchy, and the varnish chipped.  The coverings were evidently many,
for the bulk was great.  But through all, showed that unhidable human
figure, which seems to look more horrible when partially concealed than
at any other time.  What was before us was Death, and nothing else.
All the romance and sentiment of fancy had disappeared.  The two elder
men, enthusiasts who had often done such work, were not disconcerted;
and Doctor Winchester seemed to hold himself in a business-like
attitude, as if before the operating-table.  But I felt low-spirited,
and miserable, and ashamed; and besides I was pained and alarmed by
Margaret's ghastly pallor.

Then the work began.  The unrolling of the mummy cat had prepared me
somewhat for it; but this was so much larger, and so infinitely more
elaborate, that it seemed a different thing.  Moreover, in addition to
the ever present sense of death and humanity, there was a feeling of
something finer in all this.  The cat had been embalmed with coarser
materials; here, all, when once the outer coverings were removed, was
more delicately done.  It seemed as if only the finest gums and spices
had been used in this embalming.  But there were the same surroundings,
the same attendant red dust and pungent presence of bitumen; there was
the same sound of rending which marked the tearing away of the
bandages. There were an enormous number of these, and their bulk when
opened was great.  As the men unrolled them, I grew more and more
excited.  I did not take a part in it myself; Margaret had looked at me
gratefully as I drew back.  We clasped hands, and held each other hard.
As the unrolling went on, the wrappings became finer, and the smell
less laden with bitumen, but more pungent.  We all, I think, began to
feel it as though it caught or touched us in some special way.  This,
however, did not interfere with the work; it went on uninterruptedly.
Some of the inner wrappings bore symbols or pictures. These were done
sometimes wholly in pale green colour, sometimes in many colours; but
always with a prevalence of green.  Now and again Mr. Trelawny or Mr.
Corbeck would point out some special drawing before laying the bandage
on the pile behind them, which kept growing to a monstrous height.

At last we knew that the wrappings were coming to an end.  Already the
proportions were reduced to those of a normal figure of the manifest
height of the Queen, who was more than average height.  And as the end
drew nearer, so Margaret's pallor grew; and her heart beat more and
more wildly, till her breast heaved in a way that frightened me.

Just as her father was taking away the last of the bandages, he
happened to look up and caught the pained and anxious look of her pale
face.  He paused, and taking her concern to be as to the outrage on
modesty, said in a comforting way:

"Do not be uneasy, dear!  See! there is nothing to harm you.  The Queen
has on a robe.--Ay, and a royal robe, too!"

The wrapping was a wide piece the whole length of the body.  It being
removed, a profusely full robe of white linen had appeared, covering
the body from the throat to the feet.

And such linen!  We all bent over to look at it.

Margaret lost her concern, in her woman's interest in fine stuff.  Then
the rest of us looked with admiration; for surely such linen was never
seen by the eyes of our age. It was as fine as the finest silk.  But
never was spun or woven silk which lay in such gracious folds,
constrict though they were by the close wrappings of the mummy cloth,
and fixed into hardness by the passing of thousands of years.

Round the neck it was delicately embroidered in pure gold with tiny
sprays of sycamore; and round the feet, similarly worked, was an
endless line of lotus plants of unequal height, and with all the
graceful abandon of natural growth.

Across the body, but manifestly not surrounding it, was a girdle of
jewels.  A wondrous girdle, which shone and glowed with all the forms
and phases and colours of the sky!

The buckle was a great yellow stone, round of outline, deep and curved,
as if a yielding globe had been pressed down.  It shone and glowed, as
though a veritable sun lay within; the rays of its light seemed to
strike out and illumine all round. Flanking it were two great
moonstones of lesser size, whose glowing, beside the glory of the
sunstone, was like the silvery sheen of moonlight.

And then on either side, linked by golden clasps of exquisite shape,
was a line of flaming jewels, of which the colours seemed to glow.
Each of these stones seemed to hold a living star, which twinkled in
every phase of changing light.

Margaret raised her hands in ecstasy.  She bent over to examine more
closely; but suddenly drew back and stood fully erect at her grand
height.  She seemed to speak with the conviction of absolute knowledge
as she said:

"That is no cerement!  It was not meant for the clothing of death!  It
is a marriage robe!"

Mr. Trelawny leaned over and touched the linen robe.  He lifted a fold
at the neck, and I knew from the quick intake of his breath that
something had surprised him. He lifted yet a little more; and then he,
too, stood back and pointed, saying:

"Margaret is right!  That dress is not intended to be worn by the dead!
See! her figure is not robed in it.  It is but laid upon her."  He
lifted the zone of jewels and handed it to Margaret.  Then with both
hands he raised the ample robe, and laid it across the arms which she
extended in a natural impulse.  Things of such beauty were too precious
to be handled with any but the greatest care.

We all stood awed at the beauty of the figure which, save for the face
cloth, now lay completely nude before us.  Mr. Trelawny bent over, and
with hands that trembled slightly, raised this linen cloth which was of
the same fineness as the robe.  As he stood back and the whole glorious
beauty of the Queen was revealed, I felt a rush of shame sweep over me.
It was not right that we should be there, gazing with irreverent eyes
on such unclad beauty:  it was indecent; it was almost sacrilegious!
And yet the white wonder of that beautiful form was something to dream
of. It was not like death at all; it was like a statue carven in ivory
by the hand of a Praxiteles. There was nothing of that horrible
shrinkage which death seems to effect in a moment.  There was none of
the wrinkled toughness which seems to be a leading characteristic of
most mummies. There was not the shrunken attenuation of a body dried in
the sand, as I had seen before in museums.  All the pores of the body
seemed to have been preserved in some wonderful way.  The flesh was
full and round, as in a living person; and the skin was as smooth as
satin.  The colour seemed extraordinary.  It was like ivory, new ivory;
except where the right arm, with shattered, bloodstained wrist and
missing hand had lain bare to exposure in the sarcophagus for so many
tens of centuries.

With a womanly impulse; with a mouth that drooped with pity, with eyes
that flashed with anger, and cheeks that flamed, Margaret threw over
the body the beautiful robe which lay across her arm.  Only the face
was then to be seen.  This was more startling even than the body, for
it seemed not dead, but alive.  The eyelids were closed; but the long,
black, curling lashes lay over on the cheeks.  The nostrils, set in
grave pride, seemed to have the repose which, when it is seen in life,
is greater than the repose of death.  The full, red lips, though the
mouth was not open, showed the tiniest white line of pearly teeth
within.  Her hair, glorious in quantity and glossy black as the raven's
wing, was piled in great masses over the white forehead, on which a few
curling tresses strayed like tendrils.  I was amazed at the likeness to
Margaret, though I had had my mind prepared for this by Mr. Corbeck's
quotation of her father's statement.  This woman--I could not think of
her as a mummy or a corpse--was the image of Margaret as my eyes had
first lit on her.  The likeness was increased by the jewelled ornament
which she wore in her hair, the "Disk and Plumes", such as Margaret,
too, had worn.  It, too, was a glorious jewel; one noble pearl of
moonlight lustre, flanked by carven pieces of moonstone.

Mr. Trelawny was overcome as he looked.  He quite broke down; and when
Margaret flew to him and held him close in her arms and comforted him,
I heard him murmur brokenly:

"It looks as if you were dead, my child!"

There was a long silence.  I could hear without the roar of the wind,
which was now risen to a tempest, and the furious dashing of the waves
far below.  Mr. Trelawny's voice broke the spell:

"Later on we must try and find out the process of embalming.  It is not
like any that I know.  There does not seem to have been any opening cut
for the withdrawing of the viscera and organs, which apparently remain
intact within the body.  Then, again, there is no moisture in the
flesh; but its place is supplied with something else, as though wax or
stearine had been conveyed into the veins by some subtle process.  I
wonder could it be possible that at that time they could have used
paraffin.  It might have been, by some process that we know not, pumped
into the veins, where it hardened!"

Margaret, having thrown a white sheet over the Queen's body, asked us
to bring it to her own room, where we laid it on her bed.  Then she
sent us away, saying:

"Leave her alone with me.  There are still many hours to pass, and I do
not like to leave her lying there, all stark in the glare of light.
This may be the Bridal she prepared for--the Bridal of Death; and at
least she shall wear her pretty robes."

When presently she brought me back to her room, the dead Queen was
dressed in the robe of fine linen with the embroidery of gold; and all
her beautiful jewels were in place.  Candles were lit around her, and
white flowers lay upon her breast.

Hand in hand we stood looking at her for a while.  Then with a sigh,
Margaret covered her with one of her own snowy sheets.  She turned
away; and after softly closing the door of the room, went back with me
to the others who had now come into the dining room.  Here we all began
to talk over the things that had been, and that were to be.

Now and again I could feel that one or other of us was forcing
conversation, as if we were not sure of ourselves.  The long wait was
beginning to tell on our nerves.  It was apparent to me that Mr.
Trelawny had suffered in that strange trance more than we suspected, or
than he cared to show.  True, his will and his determination were as
strong as ever; but the purely physical side of him had been weakened
somewhat.  It was indeed only natural that it should be.  No man can go
through a period of four days of absolute negation of life without
being weakened by it somehow.

As the hours crept by, the time passed more and more slowly.  The other
men seemed to get unconsciously a little drowsy.  I wondered if in the
case of Mr. Trelawny and Mr. Corbeck, who had already been under the
hypnotic influence of the Queen, the same dormance was manifesting
itself.  Doctor Winchester had periods of distraction which grew longer
and more frequent as the time wore on.

As to Margaret, the suspense told on her exceedingly, as might have
been expected in the case of a woman.  She grew paler and paler still;
till at last about midnight, I began to be seriously alarmed about her.
I got her to come into the library with me, and tried to make her lie
down on a sofa for a little while.  As Mr. Trelawny had decided that
the experiment was to be made exactly at the seventh hour after sunset,
it would be as nearly as possible three o'clock in the morning when the
great trial should be made.  Even allowing a whole hour for the final
preparations, we had still two hours of waiting to go through, and I
promised faithfully to watch her and to awake her at any time she might
name.  She would not hear of it, however.  She thanked me sweetly and
smiled at me as she did so; but she assured me that she was not sleepy,
and that she was quite able to bear up.  That it was only the suspense
and excitement of waiting that made her pale.  I agreed perforce; but I
kept her talking of many things in the library for more than an hour;
so that at last, when she insisted on going back to her father's room I
felt that I had at least done something to help her pass the time.

We found the three men sitting patiently in silence.  With manlike
fortitude they were content to be still when they felt they had done
all in their power.  And so we waited.

The striking of two o'clock seemed to freshen us all up.  Whatever
shadows had been settling over us during the long hours preceding
seemed to lift at once; and we went about our separate duties alert and
with alacrity.  We looked first to the windows to see that they were
closed, and we got ready our respirators to put them on when the time
should be close at hand.  We had from the first arranged to use them
for we did not know whether some noxious fume might not come from the
magic coffer when it should be opened.  Somehow, it never seemed to
occur to any of us that there was any doubt as to its opening.

Then, under Margaret's guidance, we carried the mummied body of Queen
Tera from her room into her father's, and laid it on a couch.  We put
the sheet lightly over it, so that if she should wake she could at once
slip from under it.  The severed hand was placed in its true position
on her breast, and under it the Jewel of Seven Stars which Mr. Trelawny
had taken from the great safe.  It seemed to flash and blaze as he put
it in its place.

It was a strange sight, and a strange experience.  The group of grave
silent men carried the white still figure, which looked like an ivory
statue when through our moving the sheet fell back, away from the
lighted candles and the white flowers.  We placed it on the couch in
that other room, where the blaze of the electric lights shone on the
great sarcophagus fixed in the middle of the room ready for the final
experiment, the great experiment consequent on the researches during a
lifetime of these two travelled scholars.  Again, the startling
likeness between Margaret and the mummy, intensified by her own
extraordinary pallor, heightened the strangeness of it all.  When all
was finally fixed three-quarters of an hour had gone, for we were
deliberate in all our doings.  Margaret beckoned me, and I went out
with her to bring in Silvio.  He came to her purring.  She took him up
and handed him to me; and then did a thing which moved me strangely and
brought home to me keenly the desperate nature of the enterprise on
which we were embarked. One by one, she blew out the candles carefully
and placed them back in their usual places.  When she had finished she
said to me:

"They are done with now.  Whatever comes--life or death--there will be
no purpose in their using now."  Then taking Silvio into her arms, and
pressing him close to her bosom where he purred loudly, we went back to
the room.  I closed the door carefully behind me, feeling as I did so a
strange thrill as of finality.  There was to be no going back now.
Then we put on our respirators, and took our places as had been
arranged.  I was to stand by the taps of the electric lights beside the
door, ready to turn them off or on as Mr. Trelawny should direct.
Doctor Winchester was to stand behind the couch so that he should not
be between the mummy and the sarcophagus; he was to watch carefully
what should take place with regard to the Queen.  Margaret was to be
beside him; she held Silvio ready to place him upon the couch or beside
it when she might think right.  Mr. Trelawny and Mr. Corbeck were to
attend to the lighting of the lamps.  When the hands of the clock were
close to the hour, they stood ready with their linstocks.

The striking of the silver bell of the clock seemed to smite on our
hearts like a knell of doom.  One!  Two!  Three!

Before the third stroke the wicks of the lamps had caught, and I had
turned out the electric light.  In the dimness of the struggling lamps,
and after the bright glow of the electric light, the room and all
within it took weird shapes, and all seemed in an instant to change.
We waited with our hearts beating.  I know mine did, and I fancied I
could hear the pulsation of the others.

The seconds seemed to pass with leaden wings.  It were as though all
the world were standing still.  The figures of the others stood out
dimly, Margaret's white dress alone showing clearly in the gloom.  The
thick respirators which we all wore added to the strange appearance.
The thin light of the lamps showed Mr. Trelawny's square jaw and strong
mouth and the brown shaven face of Mr. Corbeck.  Their eyes seemed to
glare in the light.  Across the room Doctor Winchester's eyes twinkled
like stars, and Margaret's blazed like black suns.  Silvio's eyes were
like emeralds.

Would the lamps never burn up!

It was only a few seconds in all till they did blaze up.  A slow,
steady light, growing more and more bright, and changing in colour from
blue to crystal white.  So they stayed for a couple of minutes without
change in the coffer; till at last there began to appear all over it a
delicate glow.  This grew and grew, till it became like a blazing
jewel, and then like a living thing whose essence of life was light.
We waited and waited, our hearts seeming to stand still.

All at once there was a sound like a tiny muffled explosion and the
cover lifted right up on a level plane a few inches; there was no
mistaking anything now, for the whole room was full of a blaze of
light. Then the cover, staying fast at one side rose slowly up on the
other, as though yielding to some pressure of balance.  The coffer
still continued to glow; from it began to steal a faint greenish smoke.
I could not smell it fully on account of the respirator; but, even
through that, I was conscious of a strange pungent odour.  Then this
smoke began to grow thicker, and to roll out in volumes of ever
increasing density till the whole room began to get obscure.  I had a
terrible desire to rush over to Margaret, whom I saw through the smoke
still standing erect behind the couch.  Then, as I looked, I saw Doctor
Winchester sink down.  He was not unconscious; for he waved his hand
back and forward, as though to forbid any one to come to him.  At this
time the figures of Mr. Trelawny and Mr. Corbeck were becoming
indistinct in the smoke which rolled round them in thick billowy
clouds.  Finally I lost sight of them altogether.  The coffer still
continued to glow; but the lamps began to grow dim.  At first I thought
that their light was being overpowered by the thick black smoke; but
presently I saw that they were, one by one, burning out.  They must
have burned quickly to produce such fierce and vivid flames.

I waited and waited, expecting every instant to hear the command to
turn up the light; but none came.  I waited still, and looked with
harrowing intensity at the rolling billows of smoke still pouring out
of the glowing casket, whilst the lamps sank down and went out one by
one.

Finally there was but one lamp alight, and that was dimly blue and
flickering.  The only effective light in the room was from the glowing
casket.  I kept my eyes fixed toward Margaret; it was for her now that
all my anxiety was claimed.  I could just see her white frock beyond
the still white shrouded figure on the couch.  Silvio was troubled; his
piteous mewing was the only sound in the room.  Deeper and denser grew
the black mist and its pungency began to assail my nostrils as well as
my eyes. Now the volume of smoke coming from the coffer seemed to
lessen, and the smoke itself to be less dense.  Across the room I saw
something white move where the couch was.  There were several
movements. I could just catch the quick glint of white through the
dense smoke in the fading light; for now the glow of the coffer began
quickly to subside.  I could still hear Silvio, but his mewing came
from close under; a moment later I could feel him piteously crouching
on my foot.

Then the last spark of light disappeared, and through the Egyptian
darkness I could see the faint line of white around the window blinds.
I felt that the time had come to speak; so I pulled off my respirator
and called out:

"Shall I turn up the light?"  There was no answer; so before the thick
smoke choked me, I called again but more loudly:

"Mr. Trelawny, shall I turn up the light?"  He did not answer; but from
across the room I heard Margaret's voice, sounding as sweet and clear
as a bell:

"Yes, Malcolm!"  I turned the tap and the lamps flashed out.  But they
were only dim points of light in the midst of that murky ball of smoke.
In that thick atmosphere there was little possibility of illumination.
I ran across to Margaret, guided by her white dress, and caught hold of
her and held her hand.  She recognised my anxiety and said at once:

"I am all right."

"Thank God!" I said.  "How are the others?  Quick, let us open all the
windows and get rid of this smoke!"  To my surprise, she answered in a
sleepy way:

"They will be all right.  They won't get any harm."  I did not stop to
inquire how or on what ground she formed such an opinion, but threw up
the lower sashes of all the windows, and pulled down the upper.  Then I
threw open the door.

A few seconds made a perceptible change as the thick, black smoke began
to roll out of the windows.  Then the lights began to grow into
strength and I could see the room.  All the men were overcome.  Beside
the couch Doctor Winchester lay on his back as though he had sunk down
and rolled over; and on the farther side of the sarcophagus, where they
had stood, lay Mr. Trelawny and Mr. Corbeck.  It was a relief to me to
see that, though they were unconscious, all three were breathing
heavily as though in a stupor.  Margaret still stood behind the couch.
She seemed at first to be in a partially dazed condition; but every
instant appeared to get more command of herself.  She stepped forward
and helped me to raise her father and drag him close to a window.
Together we placed the others similarly, and she flew down to the
dining-room and returned with a decanter of brandy.  This we proceeded
to administer to them all in turn.  It was not many minutes after we
had opened the windows when all three were struggling back to
consciousness.  During this time my entire thoughts and efforts had
been concentrated on their restoration; but now that this strain was
off, I looked round the room to see what had been the effect of the
experiment.  The thick smoke had nearly cleared away; but the room was
still misty and was full of a strange pungent acrid odour.

The great sarcophagus was just as it had been.  The coffer was open,
and in it, scattered through certain divisions or partitions wrought in
its own substance, was a scattering of black ashes.  Over all,
sarcophagus, coffer and, indeed, all in the room, was a sort of black
film of greasy soot.  I went over to the couch.  The white sheet still
lay over part of it; but it had been thrown back, as might be when one
is stepping out of bed.

But there was no sign of Queen Tera!  I took Margaret by the hand and
led her over. She reluctantly left her father to whom she was
administering, but she came docilely enough.  I whispered to her as I
held her hand:

"What has become of the Queen?  Tell me!  You were close at hand, and
must have seen if anything happened!"  She answered me very softly:

"There was nothing that I could see.  Until the smoke grew too dense I
kept my eyes on the couch, but there was no change.  Then, when all
grew so dark that I could not see, I thought I heard a movement close
to me. It might have been Doctor Winchester who had sunk down overcome;
but I could not be sure.  I thought that it might be the Queen waking,
so I put down poor Silvio.  I did not see what became of him; but I
felt as if he had deserted me when I heard him mewing over by the door.
I hope he is not offended with me!"  As if in answer, Silvio came
running into the room and reared himself against her dress, pulling it
as though clamouring to be taken up. She stooped down and took him up
and began to pet and comfort him.

I went over and examined the couch and all around it most carefully.
When Mr. Trelawny and Mr. Corbeck recovered sufficiently, which they
did quickly, though Doctor Winchester took longer to come round, we
went over it afresh.  But all we could find was a sort of ridge of
impalpable dust, which gave out a strange dead odour.  On the couch lay
the jewel of the disk and plumes which the Queen had worn in her hair,
and the Star Jewel which had words to command the Gods.

Other than this we never got clue to what had happened.  There was just
one thing which confirmed our idea of the physical annihilation of the
mummy.  In the sarcophagus in the hall, where we had placed the mummy
of the cat, was a small patch of similar dust.

*    *    *    *    *

In the autumn Margaret and I were married.  On the occasion she wore
the mummy robe and zone and the jewel which Queen Tera had worn in her
hair. On her breast, set in a ring of gold make like a twisted lotus
stalk, she wore the strange Jewel of Seven Stars which held words to
command the God of all the worlds.  At the marriage the sunlight
streaming through the chancel windows fell on it, and it seemed to glow
like a living thing.

The graven words may have been of efficacy; for Margaret holds to them,
and there is no other life in all the world so happy as my own.

We often think of the great Queen, and we talk of her freely.  Once,
when I said with a sigh that I was sorry she could not have waked into
a new life in a new world, my wife, putting both her hands in mine and
looking into my eyes with that far-away eloquent dreamy look which
sometimes comes into her own, said lovingly:

"Do not grieve for her!  Who knows, but she may have found the joy she
sought? Love and patience are all that make for happiness in this
world; or in the world of the past or of the future; of the living or
the dead. She dreamed her dream; and that is all that any of us can
ask!"

PREFACE


A few months before the lamented death of my husband--I might say even
as the shadow of death was over him--he planned three series of short
stories for publication, and the present volume is one of them. To his
original list of stories in this book, I have added an hitherto
unpublished episode from _Dracula_. It was originally excised owing to
the length of the book, and may prove of interest to the many readers
of what is considered my husband's most remarkable work. The other
stories have already been published in English and American
periodicals. Had my husband lived longer, he might have seen fit to
revise this work, which is mainly from the earlier years of his
strenuous life. But, as fate has entrusted to me the issuing of it, I
consider it fitting and proper to let it go forth practically as it
was left by him.

Dracula's Guest


When we started for our drive the sun was shining brightly on Munich,
and the air was full of the joyousness of early summer. Just as we
were about to depart, Herr Delbrck (the matre d'htel of the Quatre
Saisons, where I was staying) came down, bareheaded, to the carriage
and, after wishing me a pleasant drive, said to the coachman, still
holding his hand on the handle of the carriage door:

'Remember you are back by nightfall. The sky looks bright but there is
a shiver in the north wind that says there may be a sudden storm. But
I am sure you will not be late.' Here he smiled, and added, 'for you
know what night it is.'

Johann answered with an emphatic, 'Ja, mein Herr,' and, touching his
hat, drove off quickly. When we had cleared the town, I said, after
signalling to him to stop:

'Tell me, Johann, what is tonight?'

He crossed himself, as he answered laconically: 'Walpurgis nacht.'
Then he took out his watch, a great, old-fashioned German silver thing
as big as a turnip, and looked at it, with his eyebrows gathered
together and a little impatient shrug of his shoulders. I realised
that this was his way of respectfully protesting against the
unnecessary delay, and sank back in the carriage, merely motioning
him to proceed. He started off rapidly, as if to make up for lost
time. Every now and then the horses seemed to throw up their heads and
sniffed the air suspiciously. On such occasions I often looked round
in alarm. The road was pretty bleak, for we were traversing a sort of
high, wind-swept plateau. As we drove, I saw a road that looked but
little used, and which seemed to dip through a little, winding valley.
It looked so inviting that, even at the risk of offending him, I
called Johann to stop--and when he had pulled up, I told him I would
like to drive down that road. He made all sorts of excuses, and
frequently crossed himself as he spoke. This somewhat piqued my
curiosity, so I asked him various questions. He answered fencingly,
and repeatedly looked at his watch in protest. Finally I said:

'Well, Johann, I want to go down this road. I shall not ask you to
come unless you like; but tell me why you do not like to go, that is
all I ask.' For answer he seemed to throw himself off the box, so
quickly did he reach the ground. Then he stretched out his hands
appealingly to me, and implored me not to go. There was just enough of
English mixed with the German for me to understand the drift of his
talk. He seemed always just about to tell me something--the very idea
of which evidently frightened him; but each time he pulled himself up,
saying, as he crossed himself: 'Walpurgis-Nacht!'

I tried to argue with him, but it was difficult to argue with a man
when I did not know his language. The advantage certainly rested with
him, for although he began to speak in English, of a very crude and
broken kind, he always got excited and broke into his native
tongue--and every time he did so, he looked at his watch. Then the
horses became restless and sniffed the air. At this he grew very pale,
and, looking around in a frightened way, he suddenly jumped forward,
took them by the bridles and led them on some twenty feet. I followed,
and asked why he had done this. For answer he crossed himself, pointed
to the spot we had left and drew his carriage in the direction of the
other road, indicating a cross, and said, first in German, then in
English: 'Buried him--him what killed themselves.'

I remembered the old custom of burying suicides at cross-roads: 'Ah! I
see, a suicide. How interesting!' But for the life of me I could not
make out why the horses were frightened.

Whilst we were talking, we heard a sort of sound between a yelp and a
bark. It was far away; but the horses got very restless, and it took
Johann all his time to quiet them. He was pale, and said, 'It sounds
like a wolf--but yet there are no wolves here now.'

'No?' I said, questioning him; 'isn't it long since the wolves were so
near the city?'

'Long, long,' he answered, 'in the spring and summer; but with the
snow the wolves have been here not so long.'

Whilst he was petting the horses and trying to quiet them, dark clouds
drifted rapidly across the sky. The sunshine passed away, and a breath
of cold wind seemed to drift past us. It was only a breath, however,
and more in the nature of a warning than a fact, for the sun came out
brightly again. Johann looked under his lifted hand at the horizon and
said:

'The storm of snow, he comes before long time.' Then he looked at his
watch again, and, straightway holding his reins firmly--for the horses
were still pawing the ground restlessly and shaking their heads--he
climbed to his box as though the time had come for proceeding on our
journey.

I felt a little obstinate and did not at once get into the carriage.

'Tell me,' I said, 'about this place where the road leads,' and I
pointed down.

Again he crossed himself and mumbled a prayer, before he answered, 'It
is unholy.'

'What is unholy?' I enquired.

'The village.'

'Then there is a village?'

'No, no. No one lives there hundreds of years.' My curiosity was
piqued, 'But you said there was a village.'

'There was.'

'Where is it now?'

Whereupon he burst out into a long story in German and English, so
mixed up that I could not quite understand exactly what he said, but
roughly I gathered that long ago, hundreds of years, men had died
there and been buried in their graves; and sounds were heard under the
clay, and when the graves were opened, men and women were found rosy
with life, and their mouths red with blood. And so, in haste to save
their lives (aye, and their souls!--and here he crossed himself) those
who were left fled away to other places, where the living lived, and
the dead were dead and not--not something. He was evidently afraid to
speak the last words. As he proceeded with his narration, he grew more
and more excited. It seemed as if his imagination had got hold of him,
and he ended in a perfect paroxysm of fear--white-faced, perspiring,
trembling and looking round him, as if expecting that some dreadful
presence would manifest itself there in the bright sunshine on the
open plain. Finally, in an agony of desperation, he cried:

'Walpurgis nacht!' and pointed to the carriage for me to get in. All
my English blood rose at this, and, standing back, I said:

'You are afraid, Johann--you are afraid. Go home; I shall return
alone; the walk will do me good.' The carriage door was open. I took
from the seat my oak walking-stick--which I always carry on my holiday
excursions--and closed the door, pointing back to Munich, and said,
'Go home, Johann--Walpurgis-nacht doesn't concern Englishmen.'

The horses were now more restive than ever, and Johann was trying to
hold them in, while excitedly imploring me not to do anything so
foolish. I pitied the poor fellow, he was deeply in earnest; but all
the same I could not help laughing. His English was quite gone now. In
his anxiety he had forgotten that his only means of making me
understand was to talk my language, so he jabbered away in his native
German. It began to be a little tedious. After giving the direction,
'Home!' I turned to go down the cross-road into the valley.

With a despairing gesture, Johann turned his horses towards Munich. I
leaned on my stick and looked after him. He went slowly along the road
for a while: then there came over the crest of the hill a man tall and
thin. I could see so much in the distance. When he drew near the
horses, they began to jump and kick about, then to scream with terror.
Johann could not hold them in; they bolted down the road, running away
madly. I watched them out of sight, then looked for the stranger, but
I found that he, too, was gone.

With a light heart I turned down the side road through the deepening
valley to which Johann had objected. There was not the slightest
reason, that I could see, for his objection; and I daresay I tramped
for a couple of hours without thinking of time or distance, and
certainly without seeing a person or a house. So far as the place was
concerned, it was desolation itself. But I did not notice this
particularly till, on turning a bend in the road, I came upon a
scattered fringe of wood; then I recognised that I had been impressed
unconsciously by the desolation of the region through which I had
passed.

I sat down to rest myself, and began to look around. It struck me that
it was considerably colder than it had been at the commencement of my
walk--a sort of sighing sound seemed to be around me, with, now and
then, high overhead, a sort of muffled roar. Looking upwards I noticed
that great thick clouds were drifting rapidly across the sky from
North to South at a great height. There were signs of coming storm in
some lofty stratum of the air. I was a little chilly, and, thinking
that it was the sitting still after the exercise of walking, I resumed
my journey.

The ground I passed over was now much more picturesque. There were no
striking objects that the eye might single out; but in all there was a
charm of beauty. I took little heed of time and it was only when the
deepening twilight forced itself upon me that I began to think of how
I should find my way home. The brightness of the day had gone. The air
was cold, and the drifting of clouds high overhead was more marked.
They were accompanied by a sort of far-away rushing sound, through
which seemed to come at intervals that mysterious cry which the driver
had said came from a wolf. For a while I hesitated. I had said I would
see the deserted village, so on I went, and presently came on a wide
stretch of open country, shut in by hills all around. Their sides were
covered with trees which spread down to the plain, dotting, in clumps,
the gentler slopes and hollows which showed here and there. I followed
with my eye the winding of the road, and saw that it curved close to
one of the densest of these clumps and was lost behind it.

As I looked there came a cold shiver in the air, and the snow began to
fall. I thought of the miles and miles of bleak country I had passed,
and then hurried on to seek the shelter of the wood in front. Darker
and darker grew the sky, and faster and heavier fell the snow, till
the earth before and around me was a glistening white carpet the
further edge of which was lost in misty vagueness. The road was here
but crude, and when on the level its boundaries were not so marked, as
when it passed through the cuttings; and in a little while I found
that I must have strayed from it, for I missed underfoot the hard
surface, and my feet sank deeper in the grass and moss. Then the wind
grew stronger and blew with ever increasing force, till I was fain to
run before it. The air became icy-cold, and in spite of my exercise I
began to suffer. The snow was now falling so thickly and whirling
around me in such rapid eddies that I could hardly keep my eyes open.
Every now and then the heavens were torn asunder by vivid lightning,
and in the flashes I could see ahead of me a great mass of trees,
chiefly yew and cypress all heavily coated with snow.

I was soon amongst the shelter of the trees, and there, in comparative
silence, I could hear the rush of the wind high overhead. Presently
the blackness of the storm had become merged in the darkness of the
night. By-and-by the storm seemed to be passing away: it now only came
in fierce puffs or blasts. At such moments the weird sound of the
wolf appeared to be echoed by many similar sounds around me.

Now and again, through the black mass of drifting cloud, came a
straggling ray of moonlight, which lit up the expanse, and showed me
that I was at the edge of a dense mass of cypress and yew trees. As
the snow had ceased to fall, I walked out from the shelter and began
to investigate more closely. It appeared to me that, amongst so many
old foundations as I had passed, there might be still standing a house
in which, though in ruins, I could find some sort of shelter for a
while. As I skirted the edge of the copse, I found that a low wall
encircled it, and following this I presently found an opening. Here
the cypresses formed an alley leading up to a square mass of some kind
of building. Just as I caught sight of this, however, the drifting
clouds obscured the moon, and I passed up the path in darkness. The
wind must have grown colder, for I felt myself shiver as I walked; but
there was hope of shelter, and I groped my way blindly on.

I stopped, for there was a sudden stillness. The storm had passed;
and, perhaps in sympathy with nature's silence, my heart seemed to
cease to beat. But this was only momentarily; for suddenly the
moonlight broke through the clouds, showing me that I was in a
graveyard, and that the square object before me was a great massive
tomb of marble, as white as the snow that lay on and all around it.
With the moonlight there came a fierce sigh of the storm, which
appeared to resume its course with a long, low howl, as of many dogs
or wolves. I was awed and shocked, and felt the cold perceptibly grow
upon me till it seemed to grip me by the heart. Then while the flood
of moonlight still fell on the marble tomb, the storm gave further
evidence of renewing, as though it was returning on its track.
Impelled by some sort of fascination, I approached the sepulchre to
see what it was, and why such a thing stood alone in such a place. I
walked around it, and read, over the Doric door, in German:

               COUNTESS DOLINGEN OF GRATZ
                        IN STYRIA
                 SOUGHT AND FOUND DEATH
                          1801

On the top of the tomb, seemingly driven through the solid marble--for
the structure was composed of a few vast blocks of stone--was a great
iron spike or stake. On going to the back I saw, graven in great
Russian letters:

          'The dead travel fast.'

There was something so weird and uncanny about the whole thing that it
gave me a turn and made me feel quite faint. I began to wish, for the
first time, that I had taken Johann's advice. Here a thought struck
me, which came under almost mysterious circumstances and with a
terrible shock. This was Walpurgis Night!

Walpurgis Night, when, according to the belief of millions of people,
the devil was abroad--when the graves were opened and the dead came
forth and walked. When all evil things of earth and air and water held
revel. This very place the driver had specially shunned. This was the
depopulated village of centuries ago. This was where the suicide lay;
and this was the place where I was alone--unmanned, shivering with
cold in a shroud of snow with a wild storm gathering again upon me! It
took all my philosophy, all the religion I had been taught, all my
courage, not to collapse in a paroxysm of fright.

And now a perfect tornado burst upon me. The ground shook as though
thousands of horses thundered across it; and this time the storm bore
on its icy wings, not snow, but great hailstones which drove with such
violence that they might have come from the thongs of Balearic
slingers--hailstones that beat down leaf and branch and made the
shelter of the cypresses of no more avail than though their stems were
standing-corn. At the first I had rushed to the nearest tree; but I
was soon fain to leave it and seek the only spot that seemed to afford
refuge, the deep Doric doorway of the marble tomb. There, crouching
against the massive bronze door, I gained a certain amount of
protection from the beating of the hailstones, for now they only drove
against me as they ricocheted from the ground and the side of the
marble.

As I leaned against the door, it moved slightly and opened inwards.
The shelter of even a tomb was welcome in that pitiless tempest, and I
was about to enter it when there came a flash of forked-lightning that
lit up the whole expanse of the heavens. In the instant, as I am a
living man, I saw, as my eyes were turned into the darkness of the
tomb, a beautiful woman, with rounded cheeks and red lips, seemingly
sleeping on a bier. As the thunder broke overhead, I was grasped as by
the hand of a giant and hurled out into the storm. The whole thing was
so sudden that, before I could realise the shock, moral as well as
physical, I found the hailstones beating me down. At the same time I
had a strange, dominating feeling that I was not alone. I looked
towards the tomb. Just then there came another blinding flash, which
seemed to strike the iron stake that surmounted the tomb and to pour
through to the earth, blasting and crumbling the marble, as in a burst
of flame. The dead woman rose for a moment of agony, while she was
lapped in the flame, and her bitter scream of pain was drowned in the
thundercrash. The last thing I heard was this mingling of dreadful
sound, as again I was seized in the giant-grasp and dragged away,
while the hailstones beat on me, and the air around seemed reverberant
with the howling of wolves. The last sight that I remembered was a
vague, white, moving mass, as if all the graves around me had sent out
the phantoms of their sheeted-dead, and that they were closing in on
me through the white cloudiness of the driving hail.

       *       *       *       *       *

Gradually there came a sort of vague beginning of consciousness; then
a sense of weariness that was dreadful. For a time I remembered
nothing; but slowly my senses returned. My feet seemed positively
racked with pain, yet I could not move them. They seemed to be numbed.
There was an icy feeling at the back of my neck and all down my spine,
and my ears, like my feet, were dead, yet in torment; but there was in
my breast a sense of warmth which was, by comparison, delicious. It
was as a nightmare--a physical nightmare, if one may use such an
expression; for some heavy weight on my chest made it difficult for me
to breathe.

This period of semi-lethargy seemed to remain a long time, and as it
faded away I must have slept or swooned. Then came a sort of loathing,
like the first stage of sea-sickness, and a wild desire to be free
from something--I knew not what. A vast stillness enveloped me, as
though all the world were asleep or dead--only broken by the low
panting as of some animal close to me. I felt a warm rasping at my
throat, then came a consciousness of the awful truth, which chilled me
to the heart and sent the blood surging up through my brain. Some
great animal was lying on me and now licking my throat. I feared to
stir, for some instinct of prudence bade me lie still; but the brute
seemed to realise that there was now some change in me, for it raised
its head. Through my eyelashes I saw above me the two great flaming
eyes of a gigantic wolf. Its sharp white teeth gleamed in the gaping
red mouth, and I could feel its hot breath fierce and acrid upon me.

For another spell of time I remembered no more. Then I became
conscious of a low growl, followed by a yelp, renewed again and again.
Then, seemingly very far away, I heard a 'Holloa! holloa!' as of many
voices calling in unison. Cautiously I raised my head and looked in
the direction whence the sound came; but the cemetery blocked my view.
The wolf still continued to yelp in a strange way, and a red glare
began to move round the grove of cypresses, as though following the
sound. As the voices drew closer, the wolf yelped faster and louder. I
feared to make either sound or motion. Nearer came the red glow, over
the white pall which stretched into the darkness around me. Then all
at once from beyond the trees there came at a trot a troop of horsemen
bearing torches. The wolf rose from my breast and made for the
cemetery. I saw one of the horsemen (soldiers by their caps and their
long military cloaks) raise his carbine and take aim. A companion
knocked up his arm, and I heard the ball whizz over my head. He had
evidently taken my body for that of the wolf. Another sighted the
animal as it slunk away, and a shot followed. Then, at a gallop, the
troop rode forward--some towards me, others following the wolf as it
disappeared amongst the snow-clad cypresses.

As they drew nearer I tried to move, but was powerless, although I
could see and hear all that went on around me. Two or three of the
soldiers jumped from their horses and knelt beside me. One of them
raised my head, and placed his hand over my heart.

'Good news, comrades!' he cried. 'His heart still beats!'

Then some brandy was poured down my throat; it put vigour into me, and
I was able to open my eyes fully and look around. Lights and shadows
were moving among the trees, and I heard men call to one another. They
drew together, uttering frightened exclamations; and the lights
flashed as the others came pouring out of the cemetery pell-mell, like
men possessed. When the further ones came close to us, those who were
around me asked them eagerly:

'Well, have you found him?'

The reply rang out hurriedly:

'No! no! Come away quick--quick! This is no place to stay, and on this
of all nights!'

'What was it?' was the question, asked in all manner of keys. The
answer came variously and all indefinitely as though the men were
moved by some common impulse to speak, yet were restrained by some
common fear from giving their thoughts.

'It--it--indeed!' gibbered one, whose wits had plainly given out for
the moment.

'A wolf--and yet not a wolf!' another put in shudderingly.

'No use trying for him without the sacred bullet,' a third remarked in
a more ordinary manner.

'Serve us right for coming out on this night! Truly we have earned
our thousand marks!' were the ejaculations of a fourth.

'There was blood on the broken marble,' another said after a
pause--'the lightning never brought that there. And for him--is he
safe? Look at his throat! See, comrades, the wolf has been lying on
him and keeping his blood warm.'

The officer looked at my throat and replied:

'He is all right; the skin is not pierced. What does it all mean? We
should never have found him but for the yelping of the wolf.'

'What became of it?' asked the man who was holding up my head, and who
seemed the least panic-stricken of the party, for his hands were
steady and without tremor. On his sleeve was the chevron of a petty
officer.

'It went to its home,' answered the man, whose long face was pallid,
and who actually shook with terror as he glanced around him fearfully.
'There are graves enough there in which it may lie. Come,
comrades--come quickly! Let us leave this cursed spot.'

The officer raised me to a sitting posture, as he uttered a word of
command; then several men placed me upon a horse. He sprang to the
saddle behind me, took me in his arms, gave the word to advance; and,
turning our faces away from the cypresses, we rode away in swift,
military order.

As yet my tongue refused its office, and I was perforce silent. I must
have fallen asleep; for the next thing I remembered was finding myself
standing up, supported by a soldier on each side of me. It was almost
broad daylight, and to the north a red streak of sunlight was
reflected, like a path of blood, over the waste of snow. The officer
was telling the men to say nothing of what they had seen, except that
they found an English stranger, guarded by a large dog.

'Dog! that was no dog,' cut in the man who had exhibited such fear. 'I
think I know a wolf when I see one.'

The young officer answered calmly: 'I said a dog.'

'Dog!' reiterated the other ironically. It was evident that his
courage was rising with the sun; and, pointing to me, he said, 'Look
at his throat. Is that the work of a dog, master?'

Instinctively I raised my hand to my throat, and as I touched it I
cried out in pain. The men crowded round to look, some stooping down
from their saddles; and again there came the calm voice of the young
officer:

'A dog, as I said. If aught else were said we should only be laughed
at.'

I was then mounted behind a trooper, and we rode on into the suburbs
of Munich. Here we came across a stray carriage, into which I was
lifted, and it was driven off to the Quatre Saisons--the young officer
accompanying me, whilst a trooper followed with his horse, and the
others rode off to their barracks.

When we arrived, Herr Delbrck rushed so quickly down the steps to
meet me, that it was apparent he had been watching within. Taking me
by both hands he solicitously led me in. The officer saluted me and
was turning to withdraw, when I recognised his purpose, and insisted
that he should come to my rooms. Over a glass of wine I warmly thanked
him and his brave comrades for saving me. He replied simply that he
was more than glad, and that Herr Delbrck had at the first taken
steps to make all the searching party pleased; at which ambiguous
utterance the matre d'htel smiled, while the officer pleaded duty
and withdrew.

'But Herr Delbrck,' I enquired, 'how and why was it that the soldiers
searched for me?'

He shrugged his shoulders, as if in depreciation of his own deed, as
he replied:

'I was so fortunate as to obtain leave from the commander of the
regiment in which I served, to ask for volunteers.'

'But how did you know I was lost?' I asked.

'The driver came hither with the remains of his carriage, which had
been upset when the horses ran away.'

'But surely you would not send a search-party of soldiers merely on
this account?'

'Oh, no!' he answered; 'but even before the coachman arrived, I had
this telegram from the Boyar whose guest you are,' and he took from
his pocket a telegram which he handed to me, and I read:


                                                 _Bistritz_.

     Be careful of my guest--his safety is most precious to me.
     Should aught happen to him, or if he be missed, spare nothing
     to find him and ensure his safety. He is English and therefore
     adventurous. There are often dangers from snow and wolves and
     night. Lose not a moment if you suspect harm to him. I answer
     your zeal with my fortune.--_Dracula_.

As I held the telegram in my hand, the room seemed to whirl around me;
and, if the attentive matre d'htel had not caught me, I think I
should have fallen. There was something so strange in all this,
something so weird and impossible to imagine, that there grew on me a
sense of my being in some way the sport of opposite forces--the mere
vague idea of which seemed in a way to paralyse me. I was certainly
under some form of mysterious protection. From a distant country had
come, in the very nick of time, a message that took me out of the
danger of the snow-sleep and the jaws of the wolf.




The Judge's House


When the time for his examination drew near Malcolm Malcolmson made up
his mind to go somewhere to read by himself. He feared the attractions
of the seaside, and also he feared completely rural isolation, for of
old he knew it charms, and so he determined to find some unpretentious
little town where there would be nothing to distract him. He refrained
from asking suggestions from any of his friends, for he argued that
each would recommend some place of which he had knowledge, and where
he had already acquaintances. As Malcolmson wished to avoid friends he
had no wish to encumber himself with the attention of friends'
friends, and so he determined to look out for a place for himself. He
packed a portmanteau with some clothes and all the books he required,
and then took ticket for the first name on the local time-table which
he did not know.

When at the end of three hours' journey he alighted at Benchurch, he
felt satisfied that he had so far obliterated his tracks as to be sure
of having a peaceful opportunity of pursuing his studies. He went
straight to the one inn which the sleepy little place contained, and
put up for the night. Benchurch was a market town, and once in three
weeks was crowded to excess, but for the remainder of the twenty-one
days it was as attractive as a desert. Malcolmson looked around the
day after his arrival to try to find quarters more isolated than even
so quiet an inn as 'The Good Traveller' afforded. There was only one
place which took his fancy, and it certainly satisfied his wildest
ideas regarding quiet; in fact, quiet was not the proper word to apply
to it--desolation was the only term conveying any suitable idea of its
isolation. It was an old rambling, heavy-built house of the Jacobean
style, with heavy gables and windows, unusually small, and set higher
than was customary in such houses, and was surrounded with a high
brick wall massively built. Indeed, on examination, it looked more
like a fortified house than an ordinary dwelling. But all these things
pleased Malcolmson. 'Here,' he thought, 'is the very spot I have been
looking for, and if I can get opportunity of using it I shall be
happy.' His joy was increased when he realised beyond doubt that it
was not at present inhabited.

From the post-office he got the name of the agent, who was rarely
surprised at the application to rent a part of the old house. Mr.
Carnford, the local lawyer and agent, was a genial old gentleman, and
frankly confessed his delight at anyone being willing to live in the
house.

'To tell you the truth,' said he, 'I should be only too happy, on
behalf of the owners, to let anyone have the house rent free for a
term of years if only to accustom the people here to see it inhabited.
It has been so long empty that some kind of absurd prejudice has grown
up about it, and this can be best put down by its occupation--if
only,' he added with a sly glance at Malcolmson, 'by a scholar like
yourself, who wants its quiet for a time.'

Malcolmson thought it needless to ask the agent about the 'absurd
prejudice'; he knew he would get more information, if he should
require it, on that subject from other quarters. He paid his three
months' rent, got a receipt, and the name of an old woman who would
probably undertake to 'do' for him, and came away with the keys in his
pocket. He then went to the landlady of the inn, who was a cheerful
and most kindly person, and asked her advice as to such stores and
provisions as he would be likely to require. She threw up her hands in
amazement when he told her where he was going to settle himself.

'Not in the Judge's House!' she said, and grew pale as she spoke. He
explained the locality of the house, saying that he did not know its
name. When he had finished she answered:

'Aye, sure enough--sure enough the very place! It is the Judge's House
sure enough.' He asked her to tell him about the place, why so called,
and what there was against it. She told him that it was so called
locally because it had been many years before--how long she could not
say, as she was herself from another part of the country, but she
thought it must have been a hundred years or more--the abode of a
judge who was held in great terror on account of his harsh sentences
and his hostility to prisoners at Assizes. As to what there was
against the house itself she could not tell. She had often asked, but
no one could inform her; but there was a general feeling that there
was _something_, and for her own part she would not take all the money
in Drinkwater's Bank and stay in the house an hour by herself. Then
she apologised to Malcolmson for her disturbing talk.

'It is too bad of me, sir, and you--and a young gentlemen, too--if you
will pardon me saying it, going to live there all alone. If you were
my boy--and you'll excuse me for saying it--you wouldn't sleep there a
night, not if I had to go there myself and pull the big alarm bell
that's on the roof!' The good creature was so manifestly in earnest,
and was so kindly in her intentions, that Malcolmson, although amused,
was touched. He told her kindly how much he appreciated her interest
in him, and added:

'But, my dear Mrs. Witham, indeed you need not be concerned about me!
A man who is reading for the Mathematical Tripos has too much to think
of to be disturbed by any of these mysterious "somethings", and his
work is of too exact and prosaic a kind to allow of his having any
corner in his mind for mysteries of any kind. Harmonical Progression,
Permutations and Combinations, and Elliptic Functions have sufficient
mysteries for me!' Mrs. Witham kindly undertook to see after his
commissions, and he went himself to look for the old woman who had
been recommended to him. When he returned to the Judge's House with
her, after an interval of a couple of hours, he found Mrs. Witham
herself waiting with several men and boys carrying parcels, and an
upholsterer's man with a bed in a car, for she said, though tables and
chairs might be all very well, a bed that hadn't been aired for mayhap
fifty years was not proper for young bones to lie on. She was
evidently curious to see the inside of the house; and though
manifestly so afraid of the 'somethings' that at the slightest sound
she clutched on to Malcolmson, whom she never left for a moment, went
over the whole place.

After his examination of the house, Malcolmson decided to take up his
abode in the great dining-room, which was big enough to serve for all
his requirements; and Mrs. Witham, with the aid of the charwoman,
Mrs. Dempster, proceeded to arrange matters. When the hampers were
brought in and unpacked, Malcolmson saw that with much kind
forethought she had sent from her own kitchen sufficient provisions to
last for a few days. Before going she expressed all sorts of kind
wishes; and at the door turned and said:

'And perhaps, sir, as the room is big and draughty it might be well to
have one of those big screens put round your bed at night--though,
truth to tell, I would die myself if I were to be so shut in with all
kinds of--of "things", that put their heads round the sides, or over
the top, and look on me!' The image which she had called up was too
much for her nerves, and she fled incontinently.

Mrs. Dempster sniffed in a superior manner as the landlady
disappeared, and remarked that for her own part she wasn't afraid of
all the bogies in the kingdom.

'I'll tell you what it is, sir,' she said; 'bogies is all kinds and
sorts of things--except bogies! Rats and mice, and beetles; and creaky
doors, and loose slates, and broken panes, and stiff drawer handles,
that stay out when you pull them and then fall down in the middle of
the night. Look at the wainscot of the room! It is old--hundreds of
years old! Do you think there's no rats and beetles there! And do you
imagine, sir, that you won't see none of them? Rats is bogies, I tell
you, and bogies is rats; and don't you get to think anything else!'

'Mrs. Dempster,' said Malcolmson gravely, making her a polite bow,
'you know more than a Senior Wrangler! And let me say, that, as a mark
of esteem for your indubitable soundness of head and heart, I shall,
when I go, give you possession of this house, and let you stay here by
yourself for the last two months of my tenancy, for four weeks will
serve my purpose.'

'Thank you kindly, sir!' she answered, 'but I couldn't sleep away
from home a night. I am in Greenhow's Charity, and if I slept a night
away from my rooms I should lose all I have got to live on. The rules
is very strict; and there's too many watching for a vacancy for me to
run any risks in the matter. Only for that, sir, I'd gladly come here
and attend on you altogether during your stay.'

'My good woman,' said Malcolmson hastily, 'I have come here on purpose
to obtain solitude; and believe me that I am grateful to the late
Greenhow for having so organised his admirable charity--whatever it
is--that I am perforce denied the opportunity of suffering from such a
form of temptation! Saint Anthony himself could not be more rigid on
the point!'

The old woman laughed harshly. 'Ah, you young gentlemen,' she said,
'you don't fear for naught; and belike you'll get all the solitude you
want here.' She set to work with her cleaning; and by nightfall, when
Malcolmson returned from his walk--he always had one of his books to
study as he walked--he found the room swept and tidied, a fire burning
in the old hearth, the lamp lit, and the table spread for supper with
Mrs. Witham's excellent fare. 'This is comfort, indeed,' he said, as
he rubbed his hands.

When he had finished his supper, and lifted the tray to the other end
of the great oak dining-table, he got out his books again, put fresh
wood on the fire, trimmed his lamp, and set himself down to a spell of
real hard work. He went on without pause till about eleven o'clock,
when he knocked off for a bit to fix his fire and lamp, and to make
himself a cup of tea. He had always been a tea-drinker, and during his
college life had sat late at work and had taken tea late. The rest
was a great luxury to him, and he enjoyed it with a sense of
delicious, voluptuous ease. The renewed fire leaped and sparkled, and
threw quaint shadows through the great old room; and as he sipped his
hot tea he revelled in the sense of isolation from his kind. Then it
was that he began to notice for the first time what a noise the rats
were making.

'Surely,' he thought, 'they cannot have been at it all the time I was
reading. Had they been, I must have noticed it!' Presently, when the
noise increased, he satisfied himself that it was really new. It was
evident that at first the rats had been frightened at the presence of
a stranger, and the light of fire and lamp; but that as the time went
on they had grown bolder and were now disporting themselves as was
their wont.

How busy they were! and hark to the strange noises! Up and down behind
the old wainscot, over the ceiling and under the floor they raced, and
gnawed, and scratched! Malcolmson smiled to himself as he recalled to
mind the saying of Mrs. Dempster, 'Bogies is rats, and rats is
bogies!' The tea began to have its effect of intellectual and nervous
stimulus, he saw with joy another long spell of work to be done before
the night was past, and in the sense of security which it gave him, he
allowed himself the luxury of a good look round the room. He took his
lamp in one hand, and went all around, wondering that so quaint and
beautiful an old house had been so long neglected. The carving of the
oak on the panels of the wainscot was fine, and on and round the doors
and windows it was beautiful and of rare merit. There were some old
pictures on the walls, but they were coated so thick with dust and
dirt that he could not distinguish any detail of them, though he held
his lamp as high as he could over his head. Here and there as he went
round he saw some crack or hole blocked for a moment by the face of a
rat with its bright eyes glittering in the light, but in an instant it
was gone, and a squeak and a scamper followed. The thing that most
struck him, however, was the rope of the great alarm bell on the roof,
which hung down in a corner of the room on the right-hand side of the
fireplace. He pulled up close to the hearth a great high-backed carved
oak chair, and sat down to his last cup of tea. When this was done he
made up the fire, and went back to his work, sitting at the corner of
the table, having the fire to his left. For a little while the rats
disturbed him somewhat with their perpetual scampering, but he got
accustomed to the noise as one does to the ticking of a clock or to
the roar of moving water; and he became so immersed in his work that
everything in the world, except the problem which he was trying to
solve, passed away from him.

He suddenly looked up, his problem was still unsolved, and there was
in the air that sense of the hour before the dawn, which is so dread
to doubtful life. The noise of the rats had ceased. Indeed it seemed
to him that it must have ceased but lately and that it was the sudden
cessation which had disturbed him. The fire had fallen low, but still
it threw out a deep red glow. As he looked he started in spite of his
_sang froid_.

There on the great high-backed carved oak chair by the right side of
the fireplace sat an enormous rat, steadily glaring at him with
baleful eyes. He made a motion to it as though to hunt it away, but it
did not stir. Then he made the motion of throwing something. Still it
did not stir, but showed its great white teeth angrily, and its cruel
eyes shone in the lamplight with an added vindictiveness.

Malcolmson felt amazed, and seizing the poker from the hearth ran at
it to kill it. Before, however, he could strike it, the rat, with a
squeak that sounded like the concentration of hate, jumped upon the
floor, and, running up the rope of the alarm bell, disappeared in the
darkness beyond the range of the green-shaded lamp. Instantly, strange
to say, the noisy scampering of the rats in the wainscot began again.

By this time Malcolmson's mind was quite off the problem; and as a
shrill cock-crow outside told him of the approach of morning, he went
to bed and to sleep.

He slept so sound that he was not even waked by Mrs. Dempster coming
in to make up his room. It was only when she had tidied up the place
and got his breakfast ready and tapped on the screen which closed in
his bed that he woke. He was a little tired still after his night's
hard work, but a strong cup of tea soon freshened him up and, taking
his book, he went out for his morning walk, bringing with him a few
sandwiches lest he should not care to return till dinner time. He
found a quiet walk between high elms some way outside the town, and
here he spent the greater part of the day studying his Laplace. On his
return he looked in to see Mrs. Witham and to thank her for her
kindness. When she saw him coming through the diamond-paned bay window
of her sanctum she came out to meet him and asked him in. She looked
at him searchingly and shook her head as she said:

'You must not overdo it, sir. You are paler this morning than you
should be. Too late hours and too hard work on the brain isn't good
for any man! But tell me, sir, how did you pass the night? Well, I
hope? But my heart! sir, I was glad when Mrs. Dempster told me this
morning that you were all right and sleeping sound when she went in.'

'Oh, I was all right,' he answered smiling, 'the "somethings" didn't
worry me, as yet. Only the rats; and they had a circus, I tell you,
all over the place. There was one wicked looking old devil that sat up
on my own chair by the fire, and wouldn't go till I took the poker to
him, and then he ran up the rope of the alarm bell and got to
somewhere up the wall or the ceiling--I couldn't see where, it was so
dark.'

'Mercy on us,' said Mrs. Witham, 'an old devil, and sitting on a chair
by the fireside! Take care, sir! take care! There's many a true word
spoken in jest.'

'How do you mean? Pon my word I don't understand.'

'An old devil! The old devil, perhaps. There! sir, you needn't laugh,'
for Malcolmson had broken into a hearty peal. 'You young folks thinks
it easy to laugh at things that makes older ones shudder. Never mind,
sir! never mind! Please God, you'll laugh all the time. It's what I
wish you myself!' and the good lady beamed all over in sympathy with
his enjoyment, her fears gone for a moment.

'Oh, forgive me!' said Malcolmson presently. 'Don't think me rude; but
the idea was too much for me--that the old devil himself was on the
chair last night!' And at the thought he laughed again. Then he went
home to dinner.

This evening the scampering of the rats began earlier; indeed it had
been going on before his arrival, and only ceased whilst his presence
by its freshness disturbed them. After dinner he sat by the fire for a
while and had a smoke; and then, having cleared his table, began to
work as before. Tonight the rats disturbed him more than they had done
on the previous night. How they scampered up and down and under and
over! How they squeaked, and scratched, and gnawed! How they, getting
bolder by degrees, came to the mouths of their holes and to the chinks
and cracks and crannies in the wainscoting till their eyes shone like
tiny lamps as the firelight rose and fell. But to him, now doubtless
accustomed to them, their eyes were not wicked; only their playfulness
touched him. Sometimes the boldest of them made sallies out on the
floor or along the mouldings of the wainscot. Now and again as they
disturbed him Malcolmson made a sound to frighten them, smiting the
table with his hand or giving a fierce 'Hsh, hsh,' so that they fled
straightway to their holes.

And so the early part of the night wore on; and despite the noise
Malcolmson got more and more immersed in his work.

All at once he stopped, as on the previous night, being overcome by a
sudden sense of silence. There was not the faintest sound of gnaw, or
scratch, or squeak. The silence was as of the grave. He remembered the
odd occurrence of the previous night, and instinctively he looked at
the chair standing close by the fireside. And then a very odd
sensation thrilled through him.

There, on the great old high-backed carved oak chair beside the
fireplace sat the same enormous rat, steadily glaring at him with
baleful eyes.

Instinctively he took the nearest thing to his hand, a book of
logarithms, and flung it at it. The book was badly aimed and the rat
did not stir, so again the poker performance of the previous night was
repeated; and again the rat, being closely pursued, fled up the rope
of the alarm bell. Strangely too, the departure of this rat was
instantly followed by the renewal of the noise made by the general rat
community. On this occasion, as on the previous one, Malcolmson could
not see at what part of the room the rat disappeared, for the green
shade of his lamp left the upper part of the room in darkness, and the
fire had burned low.

On looking at his watch he found it was close on midnight; and, not
sorry for the _divertissement_, he made up his fire and made himself
his nightly pot of tea. He had got through a good spell of work, and
thought himself entitled to a cigarette; and so he sat on the great
oak chair before the fire and enjoyed it. Whilst smoking he began to
think that he would like to know where the rat disappeared to, for he
had certain ideas for the morrow not entirely disconnected with a
rat-trap. Accordingly he lit another lamp and placed it so that it
would shine well into the right-hand corner of the wall by the
fireplace. Then he got all the books he had with him, and placed them
handy to throw at the vermin. Finally he lifted the rope of the alarm
bell and placed the end of it on the table, fixing the extreme end
under the lamp. As he handled it he could not help noticing how
pliable it was, especially for so strong a rope, and one not in use.
'You could hang a man with it,' he thought to himself. When his
preparations were made he looked around, and said complacently:

'There now, my friend, I think we shall learn something of you this
time!' He began his work again, and though as before somewhat
disturbed at first by the noise of the rats, soon lost himself in his
propositions and problems.

Again he was called to his immediate surroundings suddenly. This time
it might not have been the sudden silence only which took his
attention; there was a slight movement of the rope, and the lamp
moved. Without stirring, he looked to see if his pile of books was
within range, and then cast his eye along the rope. As he looked he
saw the great rat drop from the rope on the oak arm-chair and sit
there glaring at him. He raised a book in his right hand, and taking
careful aim, flung it at the rat. The latter, with a quick movement,
sprang aside and dodged the missile. He then took another book, and a
third, and flung them one after another at the rat, but each time
unsuccessfully. At last, as he stood with a book poised in his hand to
throw, the rat squeaked and seemed afraid. This made Malcolmson more
than ever eager to strike, and the book flew and struck the rat a
resounding blow. It gave a terrified squeak, and turning on his
pursuer a look of terrible malevolence, ran up the chair-back and made
a great jump to the rope of the alarm bell and ran up it like
lightning. The lamp rocked under the sudden strain, but it was a heavy
one and did not topple over. Malcolmson kept his eyes on the rat, and
saw it by the light of the second lamp leap to a moulding of the
wainscot and disappear through a hole in one of the great pictures
which hung on the wall, obscured and invisible through its coating of
dirt and dust.

'I shall look up my friend's habitation in the morning,' said the
student, as he went over to collect his books. 'The third picture from
the fireplace; I shall not forget.' He picked up the books one by one,
commenting on them as he lifted them. '_Conic Sections_ he does not
mind, nor _Cycloidal Oscillations_, nor the _Principia_, nor
_Quaternions_, nor _Thermodynamics_. Now for the book that fetched
him!' Malcolmson took it up and looked at it. As he did so he started,
and a sudden pallor overspread his face. He looked round uneasily and
shivered slightly, as he murmured to himself:

'The Bible my mother gave me! What an odd coincidence.' He sat down to
work again, and the rats in the wainscot renewed their gambols. They
did not disturb him, however; somehow their presence gave him a sense
of companionship. But he could not attend to his work, and after
striving to master the subject on which he was engaged gave it up in
despair, and went to bed as the first streak of dawn stole in through
the eastern window.

He slept heavily but uneasily, and dreamed much; and when Mrs.
Dempster woke him late in the morning he seemed ill at ease, and for a
few minutes did not seem to realise exactly where he was. His first
request rather surprised the servant.

'Mrs. Dempster, when I am out to-day I wish you would get the steps
and dust or wash those pictures--specially that one the third from the
fireplace--I want to see what they are.'

Late in the afternoon Malcolmson worked at his books in the shaded
walk, and the cheerfulness of the previous day came back to him as the
day wore on, and he found that his reading was progressing well. He
had worked out to a satisfactory conclusion all the problems which had
as yet baffled him, and it was in a state of jubilation that he paid a
visit to Mrs. Witham at 'The Good Traveller'. He found a stranger in
the cosy sitting-room with the landlady, who was introduced to him as
Dr. Thornhill. She was not quite at ease, and this, combined with the
doctor's plunging at once into a series of questions, made Malcolmson
come to the conclusion that his presence was not an accident, so
without preliminary he said:

'Dr. Thornhill, I shall with pleasure answer you any question you may
choose to ask me if you will answer me one question first.'

The doctor seemed surprised, but he smiled and answered at once,
'Done! What is it?'

'Did Mrs. Witham ask you to come here and see me and advise me?'

Dr. Thornhill for a moment was taken aback, and Mrs. Witham got fiery
red and turned away; but the doctor was a frank and ready man, and he
answered at once and openly.

'She did: but she didn't intend you to know it. I suppose it was my
clumsy haste that made you suspect. She told me that she did not like
the idea of your being in that house all by yourself, and that she
thought you took too much strong tea. In fact, she wants me to advise
you if possible to give up the tea and the very late hours. I was a
keen student in my time, so I suppose I may take the liberty of a
college man, and without offence, advise you not quite as a stranger.'

Malcolmson with a bright smile held out his hand. 'Shake! as they say
in America,' he said. 'I must thank you for your kindness and Mrs.
Witham too, and your kindness deserves a return on my part. I promise
to take no more strong tea--no tea at all till you let me--and I shall
go to bed tonight at one o'clock at latest. Will that do?'

'Capital,' said the doctor. 'Now tell us all that you noticed in the
old house,' and so Malcolmson then and there told in minute detail all
that had happened in the last two nights. He was interrupted every now
and then by some exclamation from Mrs. Witham, till finally when he
told of the episode of the Bible the landlady's pent-up emotions found
vent in a shriek; and it was not till a stiff glass of brandy and
water had been administered that she grew composed again. Dr.
Thornhill listened with a face of growing gravity, and when the
narrative was complete and Mrs. Witham had been restored he asked:

'The rat always went up the rope of the alarm bell?'

'Always.'

'I suppose you know,' said the Doctor after a pause, 'what the rope
is?'

'No!'

'It is,' said the Doctor slowly, 'the very rope which the hangman used
for all the victims of the Judge's judicial rancour!' Here he was
interrupted by another scream from Mrs. Witham, and steps had to be
taken for her recovery. Malcolmson having looked at his watch, and
found that it was close to his dinner hour, had gone home before her
complete recovery.

When Mrs. Witham was herself again she almost assailed the Doctor with
angry questions as to what he meant by putting such horrible ideas
into the poor young man's mind. 'He has quite enough there already to
upset him,' she added. Dr. Thornhill replied:

'My dear madam, I had a distinct purpose in it! I wanted to draw his
attention to the bell rope, and to fix it there. It may be that he is
in a highly overwrought state, and has been studying too much,
although I am bound to say that he seems as sound and healthy a young
man, mentally and bodily, as ever I saw--but then the rats--and that
suggestion of the devil.' The doctor shook his head and went on. 'I
would have offered to go and stay the first night with him but that I
felt sure it would have been a cause of offence. He may get in the
night some strange fright or hallucination; and if he does I want him
to pull that rope. All alone as he is it will give us warning, and we
may reach him in time to be of service. I shall be sitting up pretty
late tonight and shall keep my ears open. Do not be alarmed if
Benchurch gets a surprise before morning.'

'Oh, Doctor, what do you mean? What do you mean?'

'I mean this; that possibly--nay, more probably--we shall hear the
great alarm bell from the Judge's House tonight,' and the Doctor made
about as effective an exit as could be thought of.

When Malcolmson arrived home he found that it was a little after his
usual time, and Mrs. Dempster had gone away--the rules of Greenhow's
Charity were not to be neglected. He was glad to see that the place
was bright and tidy with a cheerful fire and a well-trimmed lamp. The
evening was colder than might have been expected in April, and a heavy
wind was blowing with such rapidly-increasing strength that there was
every promise of a storm during the night. For a few minutes after his
entrance the noise of the rats ceased; but so soon as they became
accustomed to his presence they began again. He was glad to hear them,
for he felt once more the feeling of companionship in their noise, and
his mind ran back to the strange fact that they only ceased to
manifest themselves when that other--the great rat with the baleful
eyes--came upon the scene. The reading-lamp only was lit and its green
shade kept the ceiling and the upper part of the room in darkness, so
that the cheerful light from the hearth spreading over the floor and
shining on the white cloth laid over the end of the table was warm and
cheery. Malcolmson sat down to his dinner with a good appetite and a
buoyant spirit. After his dinner and a cigarette he sat steadily down
to work, determined not to let anything disturb him, for he remembered
his promise to the doctor, and made up his mind to make the best of
the time at his disposal.

For an hour or so he worked all right, and then his thoughts began to
wander from his books. The actual circumstances around him, the calls
on his physical attention, and his nervous susceptibility were not to
be denied. By this time the wind had become a gale, and the gale a
storm. The old house, solid though it was, seemed to shake to its
foundations, and the storm roared and raged through its many chimneys
and its queer old gables, producing strange, unearthly sounds in the
empty rooms and corridors. Even the great alarm bell on the roof must
have felt the force of the wind, for the rope rose and fell slightly,
as though the bell were moved a little from time to time and the
limber rope fell on the oak floor with a hard and hollow sound.

As Malcolmson listened to it he bethought himself of the doctor's
words, 'It is the rope which the hangman used for the victims of the
Judge's judicial rancour,' and he went over to the corner of the
fireplace and took it in his hand to look at it. There seemed a sort
of deadly interest in it, and as he stood there he lost himself for a
moment in speculation as to who these victims were, and the grim wish
of the Judge to have such a ghastly relic ever under his eyes. As he
stood there the swaying of the bell on the roof still lifted the rope
now and again; but presently there came a new sensation--a sort of
tremor in the rope, as though something was moving along it.

Looking up instinctively Malcolmson saw the great rat coming slowly
down towards him, glaring at him steadily. He dropped the rope and
started back with a muttered curse, and the rat turning ran up the
rope again and disappeared, and at the same instant Malcolmson became
conscious that the noise of the rats, which had ceased for a while,
began again.

All this set him thinking, and it occurred to him that he had not
investigated the lair of the rat or looked at the pictures, as he had
intended. He lit the other lamp without the shade, and, holding it up
went and stood opposite the third picture from the fireplace on the
right-hand side where he had seen the rat disappear on the previous
night.

At the first glance he started back so suddenly that he almost dropped
the lamp, and a deadly pallor overspread his face. His knees shook,
and heavy drops of sweat came on his forehead, and he trembled like an
aspen. But he was young and plucky, and pulled himself together, and
after the pause of a few seconds stepped forward again, raised the
lamp, and examined the picture which had been dusted and washed, and
now stood out clearly.

It was of a judge dressed in his robes of scarlet and ermine. His face
was strong and merciless, evil, crafty, and vindictive, with a sensual
mouth, hooked nose of ruddy colour, and shaped like the beak of a bird
of prey. The rest of the face was of a cadaverous colour. The eyes
were of peculiar brilliance and with a terribly malignant expression.
As he looked at them, Malcolmson grew cold, for he saw there the very
counterpart of the eyes of the great rat. The lamp almost fell from
his hand, he saw the rat with its baleful eyes peering out through the
hole in the corner of the picture, and noted the sudden cessation of
the noise of the other rats. However, he pulled himself together, and
went on with his examination of the picture.

The Judge was seated in a great high-backed carved oak chair, on the
right-hand side of a great stone fireplace where, in the corner, a
rope hung down from the ceiling, its end lying coiled on the floor.
With a feeling of something like horror, Malcolmson recognised the
scene of the room as it stood, and gazed around him in an awestruck
manner as though he expected to find some strange presence behind him.
Then he looked over to the corner of the fireplace--and with a loud
cry he let the lamp fall from his hand.

There, in the Judge's arm-chair, with the rope hanging behind, sat the
rat with the Judge's baleful eyes, now intensified and with a fiendish
leer. Save for the howling of the storm without there was silence.

The fallen lamp recalled Malcolmson to himself. Fortunately it was of
metal, and so the oil was not spilt. However, the practical need of
attending to it settled at once his nervous apprehensions. When he had
turned it out, he wiped his brow and thought for a moment.

'This will not do,' he said to himself. 'If I go on like this I shall
become a crazy fool. This must stop! I promised the doctor I would not
take tea. Faith, he was pretty right! My nerves must have been getting
into a queer state. Funny I did not notice it. I never felt better in
my life. However, it is all right now, and I shall not be such a fool
again.'

Then he mixed himself a good stiff glass of brandy and water and
resolutely sat down to his work.

It was nearly an hour when he looked up from his book, disturbed by
the sudden stillness. Without, the wind howled and roared louder than
ever, and the rain drove in sheets against the windows, beating like
hail on the glass; but within there was no sound whatever save the
echo of the wind as it roared in the great chimney, and now and then a
hiss as a few raindrops found their way down the chimney in a lull of
the storm. The fire had fallen low and had ceased to flame, though it
threw out a red glow. Malcolmson listened attentively, and presently
heard a thin, squeaking noise, very faint. It came from the corner of
the room where the rope hung down, and he thought it was the creaking
of the rope on the floor as the swaying of the bell raised and lowered
it. Looking up, however, he saw in the dim light the great rat
clinging to the rope and gnawing it. The rope was already nearly
gnawed through--he could see the lighter colour where the strands were
laid bare. As he looked the job was completed, and the severed end of
the rope fell clattering on the oaken floor, whilst for an instant the
great rat remained like a knob or tassel at the end of the rope, which
now began to sway to and fro. Malcolmson felt for a moment another
pang of terror as he thought that now the possibility of calling the
outer world to his assistance was cut off, but an intense anger took
its place, and seizing the book he was reading he hurled it at the
rat. The blow was well aimed, but before the missile could reach him
the rat dropped off and struck the floor with a soft thud. Malcolmson
instantly rushed over towards him, but it darted away and disappeared
in the darkness of the shadows of the room. Malcolmson felt that his
work was over for the night, and determined then and there to vary the
monotony of the proceedings by a hunt for the rat, and took off the
green shade of the lamp so as to insure a wider spreading light. As he
did so the gloom of the upper part of the room was relieved, and in
the new flood of light, great by comparison with the previous
darkness, the pictures on the wall stood out boldly. From where he
stood, Malcolmson saw right opposite to him the third picture on the
wall from the right of the fireplace. He rubbed his eyes in surprise,
and then a great fear began to come upon him.

In the centre of the picture was a great irregular patch of brown
canvas, as fresh as when it was stretched on the frame. The background
was as before, with chair and chimney-corner and rope, but the figure
of the Judge had disappeared.

Malcolmson, almost in a chill of horror, turned slowly round, and then
he began to shake and tremble like a man in a palsy. His strength
seemed to have left him, and he was incapable of action or movement,
hardly even of thought. He could only see and hear.

There, on the great high-backed carved oak chair sat the Judge in his
robes of scarlet and ermine, with his baleful eyes glaring
vindictively, and a smile of triumph on the resolute, cruel mouth, as
he lifted with his hands a _black cap_. Malcolmson felt as if the
blood was running from his heart, as one does in moments of prolonged
suspense. There was a singing in his ears. Without, he could hear the
roar and howl of the tempest, and through it, swept on the storm, came
the striking of midnight by the great chimes in the market place. He
stood for a space of time that seemed to him endless still as a
statue, and with wide-open, horror-struck eyes, breathless. As the
clock struck, so the smile of triumph on the Judge's face intensified,
and at the last stroke of midnight he placed the black cap on his
head.

Slowly and deliberately the Judge rose from his chair and picked up
the piece of the rope of the alarm bell which lay on the floor, drew
it through his hands as if he enjoyed its touch, and then deliberately
began to knot one end of it, fashioning it into a noose. This he
tightened and tested with his foot, pulling hard at it till he was
satisfied and then making a running noose of it, which he held in his
hand. Then he began to move along the table on the opposite side to
Malcolmson keeping his eyes on him until he had passed him, when with
a quick movement he stood in front of the door. Malcolmson then began
to feel that he was trapped, and tried to think of what he should do.
There was some fascination in the Judge's eyes, which he never took
off him, and he had, perforce, to look. He saw the Judge
approach--still keeping between him and the door--and raise the noose
and throw it towards him as if to entangle him. With a great effort he
made a quick movement to one side, and saw the rope fall beside him,
and heard it strike the oaken floor. Again the Judge raised the noose
and tried to ensnare him, ever keeping his baleful eyes fixed on him,
and each time by a mighty effort the student just managed to evade it.
So this went on for many times, the Judge seeming never discouraged
nor discomposed at failure, but playing as a cat does with a mouse. At
last in despair, which had reached its climax, Malcolmson cast a quick
glance round him. The lamp seemed to have blazed up, and there was a
fairly good light in the room. At the many rat-holes and in the chinks
and crannies of the wainscot he saw the rats' eyes; and this aspect,
that was purely physical, gave him a gleam of comfort. He looked
around and saw that the rope of the great alarm bell was laden with
rats. Every inch of it was covered with them, and more and more were
pouring through the small circular hole in the ceiling whence it
emerged, so that with their weight the bell was beginning to sway.

Hark! it had swayed till the clapper had touched the bell. The sound
was but a tiny one, but the bell was only beginning to sway, and it
would increase.

At the sound the Judge, who had been keeping his eyes fixed on
Malcolmson, looked up, and a scowl of diabolical anger overspread his
face. His eyes fairly glowed like hot coals, and he stamped his foot
with a sound that seemed to make the house shake. A dreadful peal of
thunder broke overhead as he raised the rope again, whilst the rats
kept running up and down the rope as though working against time. This
time, instead of throwing it, he drew close to his victim, and held
open the noose as he approached. As he came closer there seemed
something paralysing in his very presence, and Malcolmson stood rigid
as a corpse. He felt the Judge's icy fingers touch his throat as he
adjusted the rope. The noose tightened--tightened. Then the Judge,
taking the rigid form of the student in his arms, carried him over and
placed him standing in the oak chair, and stepping up beside him, put
his hand up and caught the end of the swaying rope of the alarm bell.
As he raised his hand the rats fled squeaking, and disappeared through
the hole in the ceiling. Taking the end of the noose which was round
Malcolmson's neck he tied it to the hanging-bell rope, and then
descending pulled away the chair.

       *       *       *       *       *

When the alarm bell of the Judge's House began to sound a crowd soon
assembled. Lights and torches of various kinds appeared, and soon a
silent crowd was hurrying to the spot. They knocked loudly at the
door, but there was no reply. Then they burst in the door, and poured
into the great dining-room, the doctor at the head.

There at the end of the rope of the great alarm bell hung the body of
the student, and on the face of the Judge in the picture was a
malignant smile.




The Squaw


Nurnberg at the time was not so much exploited as it has been since
then. Irving had not been playing _Faust_, and the very name of the
old town was hardly known to the great bulk of the travelling public.
My wife and I being in the second week of our honeymoon, naturally
wanted someone else to join our party, so that when the cheery
stranger, Elias P. Hutcheson, hailing from Isthmian City, Bleeding
Gulch, Maple Tree County, Neb. turned up at the station at Frankfort,
and casually remarked that he was going on to see the most all-fired
old Methuselah of a town in Yurrup, and that he guessed that so much
travelling alone was enough to send an intelligent, active citizen
into the melancholy ward of a daft house, we took the pretty broad
hint and suggested that we should join forces. We found, on comparing
notes afterwards, that we had each intended to speak with some
diffidence or hesitation so as not to appear too eager, such not being
a good compliment to the success of our married life; but the effect
was entirely marred by our both beginning to speak at the same
instant--stopping simultaneously and then going on together again.
Anyhow, no matter how, it was done; and Elias P. Hutcheson became one
of our party. Straightway Amelia and I found the pleasant benefit;
instead of quarrelling, as we had been doing, we found that the
restraining influence of a third party was such that we now took every
opportunity of spooning in odd corners. Amelia declares that ever
since she has, as the result of that experience, advised all her
friends to take a friend on the honeymoon. Well, we 'did' Nurnberg
together, and much enjoyed the racy remarks of our Transatlantic
friend, who, from his quaint speech and his wonderful stock of
adventures, might have stepped out of a novel. We kept for the last
object of interest in the city to be visited the Burg, and on the day
appointed for the visit strolled round the outer wall of the city by
the eastern side.

The Burg is seated on a rock dominating the town and an immensely deep
fosse guards it on the northern side. Nurnberg has been happy in that
it was never sacked; had it been it would certainly not be so spick
and span perfect as it is at present. The ditch has not been used for
centuries, and now its base is spread with tea-gardens and orchards,
of which some of the trees are of quite respectable growth. As we
wandered round the wall, dawdling in the hot July sunshine, we often
paused to admire the views spread before us, and in especial the great
plain covered with towns and villages and bounded with a blue line of
hills, like a landscape of Claude Lorraine. From this we always turned
with new delight to the city itself, with its myriad of quaint old
gables and acre-wide red roofs dotted with dormer windows, tier upon
tier. A little to our right rose the towers of the Burg, and nearer
still, standing grim, the Torture Tower, which was, and is, perhaps,
the most interesting place in the city. For centuries the tradition of
the Iron Virgin of Nurnberg has been handed down as an instance of
the horrors of cruelty of which man is capable; we had long looked
forward to seeing it; and here at last was its home.

In one of our pauses we leaned over the wall of the moat and looked
down. The garden seemed quite fifty or sixty feet below us, and the
sun pouring into it with an intense, moveless heat like that of an
oven. Beyond rose the grey, grim wall seemingly of endless height, and
losing itself right and left in the angles of bastion and
counterscarp. Trees and bushes crowned the wall, and above again
towered the lofty houses on whose massive beauty Time has only set the
hand of approval. The sun was hot and we were lazy; time was our own,
and we lingered, leaning on the wall. Just below us was a pretty
sight--a great black cat lying stretched in the sun, whilst round her
gambolled prettily a tiny black kitten. The mother would wave her tail
for the kitten to play with, or would raise her feet and push away the
little one as an encouragement to further play. They were just at the
foot of the wall, and Elias P. Hutcheson, in order to help the play,
stooped and took from the walk a moderate sized pebble.

'See!' he said, 'I will drop it near the kitten, and they will both
wonder where it came from.'

'Oh, be careful,' said my wife; 'you might hit the dear little thing!'

'Not me, ma'am,' said Elias P. 'Why, I'm as tender as a Maine
cherry-tree. Lor, bless ye. I wouldn't hurt the poor pooty little
critter more'n I'd scalp a baby. An' you may bet your variegated socks
on that! See, I'll drop it fur away on the outside so's not to go near
her!' Thus saying, he leaned over and held his arm out at full length
and dropped the stone. It may be that there is some attractive force
which draws lesser matters to greater; or more probably that the wall
was not plump but sloped to its base--we not noticing the inclination
from above; but the stone fell with a sickening thud that came up to
us through the hot air, right on the kitten's head, and shattered out
its little brains then and there. The black cat cast a swift upward
glance, and we saw her eyes like green fire fixed an instant on Elias
P. Hutcheson; and then her attention was given to the kitten, which
lay still with just a quiver of her tiny limbs, whilst a thin red
stream trickled from a gaping wound. With a muffled cry, such as a
human being might give, she bent over the kitten licking its wounds
and moaning. Suddenly she seemed to realise that it was dead, and
again threw her eyes up at us. I shall never forget the sight, for she
looked the perfect incarnation of hate. Her green eyes blazed with
lurid fire, and the white, sharp teeth seemed to almost shine through
the blood which dabbled her mouth and whiskers. She gnashed her teeth,
and her claws stood out stark and at full length on every paw. Then
she made a wild rush up the wall as if to reach us, but when the
momentum ended fell back, and further added to her horrible appearance
for she fell on the kitten, and rose with her black fur smeared with
its brains and blood. Amelia turned quite faint, and I had to lift her
back from the wall. There was a seat close by in shade of a spreading
plane-tree, and here I placed her whilst she composed herself. Then I
went back to Hutcheson, who stood without moving, looking down on the
angry cat below.

As I joined him, he said:

'Wall, I guess that air the savagest beast I ever see--'cept once when
an Apache squaw had an edge on a half-breed what they nicknamed
"Splinters" 'cos of the way he fixed up her papoose which he stole on
a raid just to show that he appreciated the way they had given his
mother the fire torture. She got that kinder look so set on her face
that it jest seemed to grow there. She followed Splinters mor'n three
year till at last the braves got him and handed him over to her. They
did say that no man, white or Injun, had ever been so long a-dying
under the tortures of the Apaches. The only time I ever see her smile
was when I wiped her out. I kem on the camp just in time to see
Splinters pass in his checks, and he wasn't sorry to go either. He was
a hard citizen, and though I never could shake with him after that
papoose business--for it was bitter bad, and he should have been a
white man, for he looked like one--I see he had got paid out in full.
Durn me, but I took a piece of his hide from one of his skinnin' posts
an' had it made into a pocket-book. It's here now!' and he slapped the
breast pocket of his coat.

Whilst he was speaking the cat was continuing her frantic efforts to
get up the wall. She would take a run back and then charge up,
sometimes reaching an incredible height. She did not seem to mind the
heavy fall which she got each time but started with renewed vigour;
and at every tumble her appearance became more horrible. Hutcheson was
a kind-hearted man--my wife and I had both noticed little acts of
kindness to animals as well as to persons--and he seemed concerned at
the state of fury to which the cat had wrought herself.

'Wall, now!' he said, 'I du declare that that poor critter seems quite
desperate. There! there! poor thing, it was all an accident--though
that won't bring back your little one to you. Say! I wouldn't have had
such a thing happen for a thousand! Just shows what a clumsy fool of a
man can do when he tries to play! Seems I'm too darned slipperhanded
to even play with a cat. Say Colonel!' it was a pleasant way he had to
bestow titles freely--'I hope your wife don't hold no grudge against
me on account of this unpleasantness? Why, I wouldn't have had it
occur on no account.'

He came over to Amelia and apologised profusely, and she with her
usual kindness of heart hastened to assure him that she quite
understood that it was an accident. Then we all went again to the wall
and looked over.

The cat missing Hutcheson's face had drawn back across the moat, and
was sitting on her haunches as though ready to spring. Indeed, the
very instant she saw him she did spring, and with a blind unreasoning
fury, which would have been grotesque, only that it was so frightfully
real. She did not try to run up the wall, but simply launched herself
at him as though hate and fury could lend her wings to pass straight
through the great distance between them. Amelia, womanlike, got quite
concerned, and said to Elias P. in a warning voice:

'Oh! you must be very careful. That animal would try to kill you if
she were here; her eyes look like positive murder.'

He laughed out jovially. 'Excuse me, ma'am,' he said, 'but I can't
help laughin'. Fancy a man that has fought grizzlies an' Injuns bein'
careful of bein' murdered by a cat!'

When the cat heard him laugh, her whole demeanour seemed to change.
She no longer tried to jump or run up the wall, but went quietly over,
and sitting again beside the dead kitten began to lick and fondle it
as though it were alive.

'See!' said I, 'the effect of a really strong man. Even that animal
in the midst of her fury recognises the voice of a master, and bows to
him!'

'Like a squaw!' was the only comment of Elias P. Hutcheson, as we
moved on our way round the city fosse. Every now and then we looked
over the wall and each time saw the cat following us. At first she had
kept going back to the dead kitten, and then as the distance grew
greater took it in her mouth and so followed. After a while, however,
she abandoned this, for we saw her following all alone; she had
evidently hidden the body somewhere. Amelia's alarm grew at the cat's
persistence, and more than once she repeated her warning; but the
American always laughed with amusement, till finally, seeing that she
was beginning to be worried, he said:

'I say, ma'am, you needn't be skeered over that cat. I go heeled, I
du!' Here he slapped his pistol pocket at the back of his lumbar
region. 'Why sooner'n have you worried, I'll shoot the critter, right
here, an' risk the police interferin' with a citizen of the United
States for carryin' arms contrairy to reg'lations!' As he spoke he
looked over the wall, but the cat on seeing him, retreated, with a
growl, into a bed of tall flowers, and was hidden. He went on: 'Blest
if that ar critter ain't got more sense of what's good for her than
most Christians. I guess we've seen the last of her! You bet, she'll
go back now to that busted kitten and have a private funeral of it,
all to herself!'

Amelia did not like to say more, lest he might, in mistaken kindness
to her, fulfil his threat of shooting the cat: and so we went on and
crossed the little wooden bridge leading to the gateway whence ran the
steep paved roadway between the Burg and the pentagonal Torture Tower.
As we crossed the bridge we saw the cat again down below us. When she
saw us her fury seemed to return, and she made frantic efforts to get
up the steep wall. Hutcheson laughed as he looked down at her, and
said:

'Goodbye, old girl. Sorry I injured your feelin's, but you'll get over
it in time! So long!' And then we passed through the long, dim archway
and came to the gate of the Burg.

When we came out again after our survey of this most beautiful old
place which not even the well-intentioned efforts of the Gothic
restorers of forty years ago have been able to spoil--though their
restoration was then glaring white--we seemed to have quite forgotten
the unpleasant episode of the morning. The old lime tree with its
great trunk gnarled with the passing of nearly nine centuries, the
deep well cut through the heart of the rock by those captives of old,
and the lovely view from the city wall whence we heard, spread over
almost a full quarter of an hour, the multitudinous chimes of the
city, had all helped to wipe out from our minds the incident of the
slain kitten.

We were the only visitors who had entered the Torture Tower that
morning--so at least said the old custodian--and as we had the place
all to ourselves were able to make a minute and more satisfactory
survey than would have otherwise been possible. The custodian, looking
to us as the sole source of his gains for the day, was willing to meet
our wishes in any way. The Torture Tower is truly a grim place, even
now when many thousands of visitors have sent a stream of life, and
the joy that follows life, into the place; but at the time I mention
it wore its grimmest and most gruesome aspect. The dust of ages seemed
to have settled on it, and the darkness and the horror of its memories
seem to have become sentient in a way that would have satisfied the
Pantheistic souls of Philo or Spinoza. The lower chamber where we
entered was seemingly, in its normal state, filled with incarnate
darkness; even the hot sunlight streaming in through the door seemed
to be lost in the vast thickness of the walls, and only showed the
masonry rough as when the builder's scaffolding had come down, but
coated with dust and marked here and there with patches of dark stain
which, if walls could speak, could have given their own dread memories
of fear and pain. We were glad to pass up the dusty wooden staircase,
the custodian leaving the outer door open to light us somewhat on our
way; for to our eyes the one long-wick'd, evil-smelling candle stuck
in a sconce on the wall gave an inadequate light. When we came up
through the open trap in the corner of the chamber overhead, Amelia
held on to me so tightly that I could actually feel her heart beat. I
must say for my own part that I was not surprised at her fear, for
this room was even more gruesome than that below. Here there was
certainly more light, but only just sufficient to realise the horrible
surroundings of the place. The builders of the tower had evidently
intended that only they who should gain the top should have any of the
joys of light and prospect. There, as we had noticed from below, were
ranges of windows, albeit of mediaeval smallness, but elsewhere in the
tower were only a very few narrow slits such as were habitual in
places of mediaeval defence. A few of these only lit the chamber, and
these so high up in the wall that from no part could the sky be seen
through the thickness of the walls. In racks, and leaning in disorder
against the walls, were a number of headsmen's swords, great
double-handed weapons with broad blade and keen edge. Hard by were
several blocks whereon the necks of the victims had lain, with here
and there deep notches where the steel had bitten through the guard of
flesh and shored into the wood. Round the chamber, placed in all sorts
of irregular ways, were many implements of torture which made one's
heart ache to see--chairs full of spikes which gave instant and
excruciating pain; chairs and couches with dull knobs whose torture
was seemingly less, but which, though slower, were equally
efficacious; racks, belts, boots, gloves, collars, all made for
compressing at will; steel baskets in which the head could be slowly
crushed into a pulp if necessary; watchmen's hooks with long handle
and knife that cut at resistance--this a speciality of the old
Nurnberg police system; and many, many other devices for man's injury
to man. Amelia grew quite pale with the horror of the things, but
fortunately did not faint, for being a little overcome she sat down on
a torture chair, but jumped up again with a shriek, all tendency to
faint gone. We both pretended that it was the injury done to her dress
by the dust of the chair, and the rusty spikes which had upset her,
and Mr. Hutcheson acquiesced in accepting the explanation with a
kind-hearted laugh.

But the central object in the whole of this chamber of horrors was the
engine known as the Iron Virgin, which stood near the centre of the
room. It was a rudely-shaped figure of a woman, something of the bell
order, or, to make a closer comparison, of the figure of Mrs. Noah in
the children's Ark, but without that slimness of waist and perfect
_rondeur_ of hip which marks the aesthetic type of the Noah family.
One would hardly have recognised it as intended for a human figure at
all had not the founder shaped on the forehead a rude semblance of a
woman's face. This machine was coated with rust without, and covered
with dust; a rope was fastened to a ring in the front of the figure,
about where the waist should have been, and was drawn through a
pulley, fastened on the wooden pillar which sustained the flooring
above. The custodian pulling this rope showed that a section of the
front was hinged like a door at one side; we then saw that the engine
was of considerable thickness, leaving just room enough inside for a
man to be placed. The door was of equal thickness and of great weight,
for it took the custodian all his strength, aided though he was by the
contrivance of the pulley, to open it. This weight was partly due to
the fact that the door was of manifest purpose hung so as to throw its
weight downwards, so that it might shut of its own accord when the
strain was released. The inside was honeycombed with rust--nay more,
the rust alone that comes through time would hardly have eaten so deep
into the iron walls; the rust of the cruel stains was deep indeed! It
was only, however, when we came to look at the inside of the door that
the diabolical intention was manifest to the full. Here were several
long spikes, square and massive, broad at the base and sharp at the
points, placed in such a position that when the door should close the
upper ones would pierce the eyes of the victim, and the lower ones his
heart and vitals. The sight was too much for poor Amelia, and this
time she fainted dead off, and I had to carry her down the stairs, and
place her on a bench outside till she recovered. That she felt it to
the quick was afterwards shown by the fact that my eldest son bears to
this day a rude birthmark on his breast, which has, by family
consent, been accepted as representing the Nurnberg Virgin.

When we got back to the chamber we found Hutcheson still opposite the
Iron Virgin; he had been evidently philosophising, and now gave us the
benefit of his thought in the shape of a sort of exordium.

'Wall, I guess I've been learnin' somethin' here while madam has been
gettin' over her faint. 'Pears to me that we're a long way behind the
times on our side of the big drink. We uster think out on the plains
that the Injun could give us points in tryin' to make a man
uncomfortable; but I guess your old mediaeval law-and-order party
could raise him every time. Splinters was pretty good in his bluff on
the squaw, but this here young miss held a straight flush all high on
him. The points of them spikes air sharp enough still, though even the
edges air eaten out by what uster be on them. It'd be a good thing for
our Indian section to get some specimens of this here play-toy to send
round to the Reservations jest to knock the stuffin' out of the bucks,
and the squaws too, by showing them as how old civilisation lays over
them at their best. Guess but I'll get in that box a minute jest to
see how it feels!'

'Oh no! no!' said Amelia. 'It is too terrible!'

'Guess, ma'am, nothin's too terrible to the explorin' mind. I've been
in some queer places in my time. Spent a night inside a dead horse
while a prairie fire swept over me in Montana Territory--an' another
time slept inside a dead buffler when the Comanches was on the war
path an' I didn't keer to leave my kyard on them. I've been two days
in a caved-in tunnel in the Billy Broncho gold mine in New Mexico, an'
was one of the four shut up for three parts of a day in the caisson
what slid over on her side when we was settin' the foundations of the
Buffalo Bridge. I've not funked an odd experience yet, an' I don't
propose to begin now!'

We saw that he was set on the experiment, so I said: 'Well, hurry up,
old man, and get through it quick!'

'All right, General,' said he, 'but I calculate we ain't quite ready
yet. The gentlemen, my predecessors, what stood in that thar canister,
didn't volunteer for the office--not much! And I guess there was some
ornamental tyin' up before the big stroke was made. I want to go into
this thing fair and square, so I must get fixed up proper first. I
dare say this old galoot can rise some string and tie me up accordin'
to sample?'

This was said interrogatively to the old custodian, but the latter,
who understood the drift of his speech, though perhaps not
appreciating to the full the niceties of dialect and imagery, shook
his head. His protest was, however, only formal and made to be
overcome. The American thrust a gold piece into his hand, saying:
'Take it, pard! it's your pot; and don't be skeer'd. This ain't no
necktie party that you're asked to assist in!' He produced some thin
frayed rope and proceeded to bind our companion with sufficient
strictness for the purpose. When the upper part of his body was bound,
Hutcheson said:

'Hold on a moment, Judge. Guess I'm too heavy for you to tote into the
canister. You jest let me walk in, and then you can wash up regardin'
my legs!'

Whilst speaking he had backed himself into the opening which was just
enough to hold him. It was a close fit and no mistake. Amelia looked
on with fear in her eyes, but she evidently did not like to say
anything. Then the custodian completed his task by tying the
American's feet together so that he was now absolutely helpless and
fixed in his voluntary prison. He seemed to really enjoy it, and the
incipient smile which was habitual to his face blossomed into
actuality as he said:

'Guess this here Eve was made out of the rib of a dwarf! There ain't
much room for a full-grown citizen of the United States to hustle. We
uster make our coffins more roomier in Idaho territory. Now, Judge,
you jest begin to let this door down, slow, on to me. I want to feel
the same pleasure as the other jays had when those spikes began to
move toward their eyes!'

'Oh no! no! no!' broke in Amelia hysterically. 'It is too terrible! I
can't bear to see it!--I can't! I can't!' But the American was
obdurate. 'Say, Colonel,' said he, 'why not take Madame for a little
promenade? I wouldn't hurt her feelin's for the world; but now that I
am here, havin' kem eight thousand miles, wouldn't it be too hard to
give up the very experience I've been pinin' an' pantin' fur? A man
can't get to feel like canned goods every time! Me and the Judge
here'll fix up this thing in no time, an' then you'll come back, an'
we'll all laugh together!'

Once more the resolution that is born of curiosity triumphed, and
Amelia stayed holding tight to my arm and shivering whilst the
custodian began to slacken slowly inch by inch the rope that held back
the iron door. Hutcheson's face was positively radiant as his eyes
followed the first movement of the spikes.

'Wall!' he said, 'I guess I've not had enjoyment like this since I
left Noo York. Bar a scrap with a French sailor at Wapping--an' that
warn't much of a picnic neither--I've not had a show fur real pleasure
in this dod-rotted Continent, where there ain't no b'ars nor no
Injuns, an' wheer nary man goes heeled. Slow there, Judge! Don't you
rush this business! I want a show for my money this game--I du!'

The custodian must have had in him some of the blood of his
predecessors in that ghastly tower, for he worked the engine with a
deliberate and excruciating slowness which after five minutes, in
which the outer edge of the door had not moved half as many inches,
began to overcome Amelia. I saw her lips whiten, and felt her hold
upon my arm relax. I looked around an instant for a place whereon to
lay her, and when I looked at her again found that her eye had become
fixed on the side of the Virgin. Following its direction I saw the
black cat crouching out of sight. Her green eyes shone like danger
lamps in the gloom of the place, and their colour was heightened by
the blood which still smeared her coat and reddened her mouth. I cried
out:

'The cat! look out for the cat!' for even then she sprang out before
the engine. At this moment she looked like a triumphant demon. Her
eyes blazed with ferocity, her hair bristled out till she seemed twice
her normal size, and her tail lashed about as does a tiger's when the
quarry is before it. Elias P. Hutcheson when he saw her was amused,
and his eyes positively sparkled with fun as he said:

'Darned if the squaw hain't got on all her war paint! Jest give her a
shove off if she comes any of her tricks on me, for I'm so fixed
everlastingly by the boss, that durn my skin if I can keep my eyes
from her if she wants them! Easy there, Judge! don't you slack that ar
rope or I'm euchered!'

At this moment Amelia completed her faint, and I had to clutch hold of
her round the waist or she would have fallen to the floor. Whilst
attending to her I saw the black cat crouching for a spring, and
jumped up to turn the creature out.

But at that instant, with a sort of hellish scream, she hurled
herself, not as we expected at Hutcheson, but straight at the face of
the custodian. Her claws seemed to be tearing wildly as one sees in
the Chinese drawings of the dragon rampant, and as I looked I saw one
of them light on the poor man's eye, and actually tear through it and
down his cheek, leaving a wide band of red where the blood seemed to
spurt from every vein.

With a yell of sheer terror which came quicker than even his sense of
pain, the man leaped back, dropping as he did so the rope which held
back the iron door. I jumped for it, but was too late, for the cord
ran like lightning through the pulley-block, and the heavy mass fell
forward from its own weight.

As the door closed I caught a glimpse of our poor companion's face. He
seemed frozen with terror. His eyes stared with a horrible anguish as
if dazed, and no sound came from his lips.

And then the spikes did their work. Happily the end was quick, for
when I wrenched open the door they had pierced so deep that they had
locked in the bones of the skull through which they had crushed, and
actually tore him--it--out of his iron prison till, bound as he was,
he fell at full length with a sickly thud upon the floor, the face
turning upward as he fell.

I rushed to my wife, lifted her up and carried her out, for I feared
for her very reason if she should wake from her faint to such a scene.
I laid her on the bench outside and ran back. Leaning against the
wooden column was the custodian moaning in pain whilst he held his
reddening handkerchief to his eyes. And sitting on the head of the
poor American was the cat, purring loudly as she licked the blood
which trickled through the gashed socket of his eyes.

I think no one will call me cruel because I seized one of the old
executioner's swords and shore her in two as she sat.




The Secret of the Growing Gold


When Margaret Delandre went to live at Brent's Rock the whole
neighbourhood awoke to the pleasure of an entirely new scandal.
Scandals in connection with either the Delandre family or the Brents
of Brent's Rock, were not few; and if the secret history of the county
had been written in full both names would have been found well
represented. It is true that the status of each was so different that
they might have belonged to different continents--or to different
worlds for the matter of that--for hitherto their orbits had never
crossed. The Brents were accorded by the whole section of the country
a unique social dominance, and had ever held themselves as high above
the yeoman class to which Margaret Delandre belonged, as a
blue-blooded Spanish hidalgo out-tops his peasant tenantry.

The Delandres had an ancient record and were proud of it in their way
as the Brents were of theirs. But the family had never risen above
yeomanry; and although they had been once well-to-do in the good old
times of foreign wars and protection, their fortunes had withered
under the scorching of the free trade sun and the 'piping times of
peace.' They had, as the elder members used to assert, 'stuck to the
land', with the result that they had taken root in it, body and soul.
In fact, they, having chosen the life of vegetables, had flourished
as vegetation does--blossomed and thrived in the good season and
suffered in the bad. Their holding, Dander's Croft, seemed to have
been worked out, and to be typical of the family which had inhabited
it. The latter had declined generation after generation, sending out
now and again some abortive shoot of unsatisfied energy in the shape
of a soldier or sailor, who had worked his way to the minor grades of
the services and had there stopped, cut short either from unheeding
gallantry in action or from that destroying cause to men without
breeding or youthful care--the recognition of a position above them
which they feel unfitted to fill. So, little by little, the family
dropped lower and lower, the men brooding and dissatisfied, and
drinking themselves into the grave, the women drudging at home, or
marrying beneath them--or worse. In process of time all disappeared,
leaving only two in the Croft, Wykham Delandre and his sister
Margaret. The man and woman seemed to have inherited in masculine and
feminine form respectively the evil tendency of their race, sharing in
common the principles, though manifesting them in different ways, of
sullen passion, voluptuousness and recklessness.

The history of the Brents had been something similar, but showing the
causes of decadence in their aristocratic and not their plebeian
forms. They, too, had sent their shoots to the wars; but their
positions had been different and they had often attained honour--for
without flaw they were gallant, and brave deeds were done by them
before the selfish dissipation which marked them had sapped their
vigour.

The present head of the family--if family it could now be called when
one remained of the direct line--was Geoffrey Brent. He was almost a
type of worn out race, manifesting in some ways its most brilliant
qualities, and in others its utter degradation. He might be fairly
compared with some of those antique Italian nobles whom the painters
have preserved to us with their courage, their unscrupulousness, their
refinement of lust and cruelty--the voluptuary actual with the fiend
potential. He was certainly handsome, with that dark, aquiline,
commanding beauty which women so generally recognise as dominant. With
men he was distant and cold; but such a bearing never deters
womankind. The inscrutable laws of sex have so arranged that even a
timid woman is not afraid of a fierce and haughty man. And so it was
that there was hardly a woman of any kind or degree, who lived within
view of Brent's Rock, who did not cherish some form of secret
admiration for the handsome wastrel. The category was a wide one, for
Brent's Rock rose up steeply from the midst of a level region and for
a circuit of a hundred miles it lay on the horizon, with its high old
towers and steep roofs cutting the level edge of wood and hamlet, and
far-scattered mansions.

So long as Geoffrey Brent confined his dissipations to London and
Paris and Vienna--anywhere out of sight and sound of his home--opinion
was silent. It is easy to listen to far off echoes unmoved, and we can
treat them with disbelief, or scorn, or disdain, or whatever attitude
of coldness may suit our purpose. But when the scandal came close home
it was another matter; and the feelings of independence and integrity
which is in people of every community which is not utterly spoiled,
asserted itself and demanded that condemnation should be expressed.
Still there was a certain reticence in all, and no more notice was
taken of the existing facts than was absolutely necessary. Margaret
Delandre bore herself so fearlessly and so openly--she accepted her
position as the justified companion of Geoffrey Brent so naturally
that people came to believe that she was secretly married to him, and
therefore thought it wiser to hold their tongues lest time should
justify her and also make her an active enemy.

The one person who, by his interference, could have settled all doubts
was debarred by circumstances from interfering in the matter. Wykham
Delandre had quarrelled with his sister--or perhaps it was that she
had quarrelled with him--and they were on terms not merely of armed
neutrality but of bitter hatred. The quarrel had been antecedent to
Margaret going to Brent's Rock. She and Wykham had almost come to
blows. There had certainly been threats on one side and on the other;
and in the end Wykham, overcome with passion, had ordered his sister
to leave his house. She had risen straightway, and, without waiting to
pack up even her own personal belongings, had walked out of the house.
On the threshold she had paused for a moment to hurl a bitter threat
at Wykham that he would rue in shame and despair to the last hour of
his life his act of that day. Some weeks had since passed; and it was
understood in the neighbourhood that Margaret had gone to London, when
she suddenly appeared driving out with Geoffrey Brent, and the entire
neighbourhood knew before nightfall that she had taken up her abode at
the Rock. It was no subject of surprise that Brent had come back
unexpectedly, for such was his usual custom. Even his own servants
never knew when to expect him, for there was a private door, of which
he alone had the key, by which he sometimes entered without anyone in
the house being aware of his coming. This was his usual method of
appearing after a long absence.

Wykham Delandre was furious at the news. He vowed vengeance--and to
keep his mind level with his passion drank deeper than ever. He tried
several times to see his sister, but she contemptuously refused to
meet him. He tried to have an interview with Brent and was refused by
him also. Then he tried to stop him in the road, but without avail,
for Geoffrey was not a man to be stopped against his will. Several
actual encounters took place between the two men, and many more were
threatened and avoided. At last Wykham Delandre settled down to a
morose, vengeful acceptance of the situation.

Neither Margaret nor Geoffrey was of a pacific temperament, and it was
not long before there began to be quarrels between them. One thing
would lead to another, and wine flowed freely at Brent's Rock. Now and
again the quarrels would assume a bitter aspect, and threats would be
exchanged in uncompromising language that fairly awed the listening
servants. But such quarrels generally ended where domestic
altercations do, in reconciliation, and in a mutual respect for the
fighting qualities proportionate to their manifestation. Fighting for
its own sake is found by a certain class of persons, all the world
over, to be a matter of absorbing interest, and there is no reason to
believe that domestic conditions minimise its potency. Geoffrey and
Margaret made occasional absences from Brent's Rock, and on each of
these occasions Wykham Delandre also absented himself; but as he
generally heard of the absence too late to be of any service, he
returned home each time in a more bitter and discontented frame of
mind than before.

At last there came a time when the absence from Brent's Rock became
longer than before. Only a few days earlier there had been a quarrel,
exceeding in bitterness anything which had gone before; but this, too,
had been made up, and a trip on the Continent had been mentioned
before the servants. After a few days Wykham Delandre also went away,
and it was some weeks before he returned. It was noticed that he was
full of some new importance--satisfaction, exaltation--they hardly
knew how to call it. He went straightway to Brent's Rock, and demanded
to see Geoffrey Brent, and on being told that he had not yet returned,
said, with a grim decision which the servants noted:

'I shall come again. My news is solid--it can wait!' and turned away.
Week after week went by, and month after month; and then there came a
rumour, certified later on, that an accident had occurred in the
Zermatt valley. Whilst crossing a dangerous pass the carriage
containing an English lady and the driver had fallen over a precipice,
the gentleman of the party, Mr. Geoffrey Brent, having been
fortunately saved as he had been walking up the hill to ease the
horses. He gave information, and search was made. The broken rail, the
excoriated roadway, the marks where the horses had struggled on the
decline before finally pitching over into the torrent--all told the
sad tale. It was a wet season, and there had been much snow in the
winter, so that the river was swollen beyond its usual volume, and the
eddies of the stream were packed with ice. All search was made, and
finally the wreck of the carriage and the body of one horse were found
in an eddy of the river. Later on the body of the driver was found on
the sandy, torrent-swept waste near Tsch; but the body of the lady,
like that of the other horse, had quite disappeared, and was--what
was left of it by that time--whirling amongst the eddies of the Rhone
on its way down to the Lake of Geneva.

Wykham Delandre made all the enquiries possible, but could not find
any trace of the missing woman. He found, however, in the books of the
various hotels the name of 'Mr. and Mrs. Geoffrey Brent'. And he had a
stone erected at Zermatt to his sister's memory, under her married
name, and a tablet put up in the church at Bretten, the parish in
which both Brent's Rock and Dander's Croft were situated.

There was a lapse of nearly a year, after the excitement of the matter
had worn away, and the whole neighbourhood had gone on its accustomed
way. Brent was still absent, and Delandre more drunken, more morose,
and more revengeful than before.

Then there was a new excitement. Brent's Rock was being made ready for
a new mistress. It was officially announced by Geoffrey himself in a
letter to the Vicar, that he had been married some months before to an
Italian lady, and that they were then on their way home. Then a small
army of workmen invaded the house; and hammer and plane sounded, and a
general air of size and paint pervaded the atmosphere. One wing of the
old house, the south, was entirely re-done; and then the great body of
the workmen departed, leaving only materials for the doing of the old
hall when Geoffrey Brent should have returned, for he had directed
that the decoration was only to be done under his own eyes. He had
brought with him accurate drawings of a hall in the house of his
bride's father, for he wished to reproduce for her the place to which
she had been accustomed. As the moulding had all to be re-done, some
scaffolding poles and boards were brought in and laid on one side of
the great hall, and also a great wooden tank or box for mixing the
lime, which was laid in bags beside it.

When the new mistress of Brent's Rock arrived the bells of the church
rang out, and there was a general jubilation. She was a beautiful
creature, full of the poetry and fire and passion of the South; and
the few English words which she had learned were spoken in such a
sweet and pretty broken way that she won the hearts of the people
almost as much by the music of her voice as by the melting beauty of
her dark eyes.

Geoffrey Brent seemed more happy than he had ever before appeared; but
there was a dark, anxious look on his face that was new to those who
knew him of old, and he started at times as though at some noise that
was unheard by others.

And so months passed and the whisper grew that at last Brent's Rock
was to have an heir. Geoffrey was very tender to his wife, and the new
bond between them seemed to soften him. He took more interest in his
tenants and their needs than he had ever done; and works of charity on
his part as well as on his sweet young wife's were not lacking. He
seemed to have set all his hopes on the child that was coming, and as
he looked deeper into the future the dark shadow that had come over
his face seemed to die gradually away.

All the time Wykham Delandre nursed his revenge. Deep in his heart had
grown up a purpose of vengeance which only waited an opportunity to
crystallise and take a definite shape. His vague idea was somehow
centred in the wife of Brent, for he knew that he could strike him
best through those he loved, and the coming time seemed to hold in its
womb the opportunity for which he longed. One night he sat alone in
the living-room of his house. It had once been a handsome room in its
way, but time and neglect had done their work and it was now little
better than a ruin, without dignity or picturesqueness of any kind. He
had been drinking heavily for some time and was more than half
stupefied. He thought he heard a noise as of someone at the door and
looked up. Then he called half savagely to come in; but there was no
response. With a muttered blasphemy he renewed his potations.
Presently he forgot all around him, sank into a daze, but suddenly
awoke to see standing before him someone or something like a battered,
ghostly edition of his sister. For a few moments there came upon him a
sort of fear. The woman before him, with distorted features and
burning eyes seemed hardly human, and the only thing that seemed a
reality of his sister, as she had been, was her wealth of golden hair,
and this was now streaked with grey. She eyed her brother with a long,
cold stare; and he, too, as he looked and began to realise the
actuality of her presence, found the hatred of her which he had had,
once again surging up in his heart. All the brooding passion of the
past year seemed to find a voice at once as he asked her:

'Why are you here? You're dead and buried.'

'I am here, Wykham Delandre, for no love of you, but because I hate
another even more than I do you!' A great passion blazed in her eyes.

'Him?' he asked, in so fierce a whisper that even the woman was for an
instant startled till she regained her calm.

'Yes, him!' she answered. 'But make no mistake, my revenge is my own;
and I merely use you to help me to it.' Wykham asked suddenly:

'Did he marry you?'

The woman's distorted face broadened out in a ghastly attempt at a
smile. It was a hideous mockery, for the broken features and seamed
scars took strange shapes and strange colours, and queer lines of
white showed out as the straining muscles pressed on the old
cicatrices.

'So you would like to know! It would please your pride to feel that
your sister was truly married! Well, you shall not know. That was my
revenge on you, and I do not mean to change it by a hair's breadth. I
have come here tonight simply to let you know that I am alive, so that
if any violence be done me where I am going there may be a witness.'

'Where are you going?' demanded her brother.

'That is my affair! and I have not the least intention of letting you
know!' Wykham stood up, but the drink was on him and he reeled and
fell. As he lay on the floor he announced his intention of following
his sister; and with an outburst of splenetic humour told her that he
would follow her through the darkness by the light of her hair, and of
her beauty. At this she turned on him, and said that there were others
beside him that would rue her hair and her beauty too. 'As he will,'
she hissed; 'for the hair remains though the beauty be gone. When he
withdrew the lynch-pin and sent us over the precipice into the
torrent, he had little thought of my beauty. Perhaps his beauty would
be scarred like mine were he whirled, as I was, among the rocks of the
Visp, and frozen on the ice pack in the drift of the river. But let
him beware! His time is coming!' and with a fierce gesture she flung
open the door and passed out into the night.

       *       *       *       *       *

Later on that night, Mrs. Brent, who was but half-asleep, became
suddenly awake and spoke to her husband:

'Geoffrey, was not that the click of a lock somewhere below our
window?'

But Geoffrey--though she thought that he, too, had started at the
noise--seemed sound asleep, and breathed heavily. Again Mrs. Brent
dozed; but this time awoke to the fact that her husband had arisen and
was partially dressed. He was deadly pale, and when the light of the
lamp which he had in his hand fell on his face, she was frightened at
the look in his eyes.

'What is it, Geoffrey? What dost thou?' she asked.

'Hush! little one,' he answered, in a strange, hoarse voice. 'Go to
sleep. I am restless, and wish to finish some work I left undone.'

'Bring it here, my husband,' she said; 'I am lonely and I fear when
thou art away.'

For reply he merely kissed her and went out, closing the door behind
him. She lay awake for awhile, and then nature asserted itself, and
she slept.

Suddenly she started broad awake with the memory in her ears of a
smothered cry from somewhere not far off. She jumped up and ran to the
door and listened, but there was no sound. She grew alarmed for her
husband, and called out: 'Geoffrey! Geoffrey!'

After a few moments the door of the great hall opened, and Geoffrey
appeared at it, but without his lamp.

'Hush!' he said, in a sort of whisper, and his voice was harsh and
stern. 'Hush! Get to bed! I am working, and must not be disturbed. Go
to sleep, and do not wake the house!'

With a chill in her heart--for the harshness of her husband's voice
was new to her--she crept back to bed and lay there trembling, too
frightened to cry, and listened to every sound. There was a long pause
of silence, and then the sound of some iron implement striking muffled
blows! Then there came a clang of a heavy stone falling, followed by a
muffled curse. Then a dragging sound, and then more noise of stone on
stone. She lay all the while in an agony of fear, and her heart beat
dreadfully. She heard a curious sort of scraping sound; and then there
was silence. Presently the door opened gently, and Geoffrey appeared.
His wife pretended to be asleep; but through her eyelashes she saw him
wash from his hands something white that looked like lime.

In the morning he made no allusion to the previous night, and she was
afraid to ask any question.

From that day there seemed some shadow over Geoffrey Brent. He neither
ate nor slept as he had been accustomed, and his former habit of
turning suddenly as though someone were speaking from behind him
revived. The old hall seemed to have some kind of fascination for him.
He used to go there many times in the day, but grew impatient if
anyone, even his wife, entered it. When the builder's foreman came to
inquire about continuing his work Geoffrey was out driving; the man
went into the hall, and when Geoffrey returned the servant told him of
his arrival and where he was. With a frightful oath he pushed the
servant aside and hurried up to the old hall. The workman met him
almost at the door; and as Geoffrey burst into the room he ran against
him. The man apologised:

'Beg pardon, sir, but I was just going out to make some enquiries. I
directed twelve sacks of lime to be sent here, but I see there are
only ten.'

'Damn the ten sacks and the twelve too!' was the ungracious and
incomprehensible rejoinder.

The workman looked surprised, and tried to turn the conversation.

'I see, sir, there is a little matter which our people must have done;
but the governor will of course see it set right at his own cost.'

'What do you mean?'

'That 'ere 'arth-stone, sir: Some idiot must have put a scaffold pole
on it and cracked it right down the middle, and it's thick enough
you'd think to stand hanythink.' Geoffrey was silent for quite a
minute, and then said in a constrained voice and with much gentler
manner:

'Tell your people that I am not going on with the work in the hall at
present. I want to leave it as it is for a while longer.'

'All right sir. I'll send up a few of our chaps to take away these
poles and lime bags and tidy the place up a bit.'

'No! No!' said Geoffrey, 'leave them where they are. I shall send and
tell you when you are to get on with the work.' So the foreman went
away, and his comment to his master was:

'I'd send in the bill, sir, for the work already done. 'Pears to me
that money's a little shaky in that quarter.'

Once or twice Delandre tried to stop Brent on the road, and, at last,
finding that he could not attain his object rode after the carriage,
calling out:

'What has become of my sister, your wife?' Geoffrey lashed his horses
into a gallop, and the other, seeing from his white face and from his
wife's collapse almost into a faint that his object was attained, rode
away with a scowl and a laugh.

That night when Geoffrey went into the hall he passed over to the
great fireplace, and all at once started back with a smothered cry.
Then with an effort he pulled himself together and went away,
returning with a light. He bent down over the broken hearth-stone to
see if the moonlight falling through the storied window had in any way
deceived him. Then with a groan of anguish he sank to his knees.

There, sure enough, through the crack in the broken stone were
protruding a multitude of threads of golden hair just tinged with
grey!

He was disturbed by a noise at the door, and looking round, saw his
wife standing in the doorway. In the desperation of the moment he took
action to prevent discovery, and lighting a match at the lamp, stooped
down and burned away the hair that rose through the broken stone. Then
rising nonchalantly as he could, he pretended surprise at seeing his
wife beside him.

For the next week he lived in an agony; for, whether by accident or
design, he could not find himself alone in the hall for any length of
time. At each visit the hair had grown afresh through the crack, and
he had to watch it carefully lest his terrible secret should be
discovered. He tried to find a receptacle for the body of the murdered
woman outside the house, but someone always interrupted him; and once,
when he was coming out of the private doorway, he was met by his wife,
who began to question him about it, and manifested surprise that she
should not have before noticed the key which he now reluctantly showed
her. Geoffrey dearly and passionately loved his wife, so that any
possibility of her discovering his dread secrets, or even of doubting
him, filled him with anguish; and after a couple of days had passed,
he could not help coming to the conclusion that, at least, she
suspected something.

That very evening she came into the hall after her drive and found him
there sitting moodily by the deserted fireplace. She spoke to him
directly.

'Geoffrey, I have been spoken to by that fellow Delandre, and he says
horrible things. He tells to me that a week ago his sister returned to
his house, the wreck and ruin of her former self, with only her golden
hair as of old, and announced some fell intention. He asked me where
she is--and oh, Geoffrey, she is dead, she is dead! So how can she
have returned? Oh! I am in dread, and I know not where to turn!'

For answer, Geoffrey burst into a torrent of blasphemy which made her
shudder. He cursed Delandre and his sister and all their kind, and in
especial he hurled curse after curse on her golden hair.

'Oh, hush! hush!' she said, and was then silent, for she feared her
husband when she saw the evil effect of his humour. Geoffrey in the
torrent of his anger stood up and moved away from the hearth; but
suddenly stopped as he saw a new look of terror in his wife's eyes. He
followed their glance, and then he too, shuddered--for there on the
broken hearth-stone lay a golden streak as the point of the hair rose
though the crack.

'Look, look!' she shrieked. 'Is it some ghost of the dead! Come
away--come away!' and seizing her husband by the wrist with the frenzy
of madness, she pulled him from the room.

That night she was in a raging fever. The doctor of the district
attended her at once, and special aid was telegraphed for to London.
Geoffrey was in despair, and in his anguish at the danger of his young
wife almost forgot his own crime and its consequences. In the evening
the doctor had to leave to attend to others; but he left Geoffrey in
charge of his wife. His last words were:

'Remember, you must humour her till I come in the morning, or till
some other doctor has her case in hand. What you have to dread is
another attack of emotion. See that she is kept warm. Nothing more can
be done.'

Late in the evening, when the rest of the household had retired,
Geoffrey's wife got up from her bed and called to her husband.

'Come!' she said. 'Come to the old hall! I know where the gold comes
from! I want to see it grow!'

Geoffrey would fain have stopped her, but he feared for her life or
reason on the one hand, and lest in a paroxysm she should shriek out
her terrible suspicion, and seeing that it was useless to try to
prevent her, wrapped a warm rug around her and went with her to the
old hall. When they entered, she turned and shut the door and locked
it.

'We want no strangers amongst us three tonight!' she whispered with a
wan smile.

'We three! nay we are but two,' said Geoffrey with a shudder; he
feared to say more.

'Sit here,' said his wife as she put out the light. 'Sit here by the
hearth and watch the gold growing. The silver moonlight is jealous!
See, it steals along the floor towards the gold--our gold!' Geoffrey
looked with growing horror, and saw that during the hours that had
passed the golden hair had protruded further through the broken
hearth-stone. He tried to hide it by placing his feet over the broken
place; and his wife, drawing her chair beside him, leant over and
laid her head on his shoulder.

'Now do not stir, dear,' she said; 'let us sit still and watch. We
shall find the secret of the growing gold!' He passed his arm round
her and sat silent; and as the moonlight stole along the floor she
sank to sleep.

He feared to wake her; and so sat silent and miserable as the hours
stole away.

Before his horror-struck eyes the golden-hair from the broken stone
grew and grew; and as it increased, so his heart got colder and
colder, till at last he had not power to stir, and sat with eyes full
of terror watching his doom.

       *       *       *       *       *

In the morning when the London doctor came, neither Geoffrey nor his
wife could be found. Search was made in all the rooms, but without
avail. As a last resource the great door of the old hall was broken
open, and those who entered saw a grim and sorry sight.

There by the deserted hearth Geoffrey Brent and his young wife sat
cold and white and dead. Her face was peaceful, and her eyes were
closed in sleep; but his face was a sight that made all who saw it
shudder, for there was on it a look of unutterable horror. The eyes
were open and stared glassily at his feet, which were twined with
tresses of golden hair, streaked with grey, which came through the
broken hearth-stone.




The Gipsy Prophecy


'I really think,' said the Doctor, 'that, at any rate, one of us
should go and try whether or not the thing is an imposture.'

'Good!' said Considine. 'After dinner we will take our cigars and
stroll over to the camp.'

Accordingly, when the dinner was over, and the _La Tour_ finished,
Joshua Considine and his friend, Dr Burleigh, went over to the east
side of the moor, where the gipsy encampment lay. As they were
leaving, Mary Considine, who had walked as far as the end of the
garden where it opened into the laneway, called after her husband:

'Mind, Joshua, you are to give them a fair chance, but don't give them
any clue to a fortune--and don't you get flirting with any of the
gipsy maidens--and take care to keep Gerald out of harm.'

For answer Considine held up his hand, as if taking a stage oath, and
whistled the air of the old song, 'The Gipsy Countess.' Gerald joined
in the strain, and then, breaking into merry laughter, the two men
passed along the laneway to the common, turning now and then to wave
their hands to Mary, who leaned over the gate, in the twilight,
looking after them.

It was a lovely evening in the summer; the very air was full of rest
and quiet happiness, as though an outward type of the peacefulness and
joy which made a heaven of the home of the young married folk.
Considine's life had not been an eventful one. The only disturbing
element which he had ever known was in his wooing of Mary Winston, and
the long-continued objection of her ambitious parents, who expected a
brilliant match for their only daughter. When Mr. and Mrs. Winston had
discovered the attachment of the young barrister, they had tried to
keep the young people apart by sending their daughter away for a long
round of visits, having made her promise not to correspond with her
lover during her absence. Love, however, had stood the test. Neither
absence nor neglect seemed to cool the passion of the young man, and
jealousy seemed a thing unknown to his sanguine nature; so, after a
long period of waiting, the parents had given in, and the young folk
were married.

They had been living in the cottage a few months, and were just
beginning to feel at home. Gerald Burleigh, Joshua's old college chum,
and himself a sometime victim of Mary's beauty, had arrived a week
before, to stay with them for as long a time as he could tear himself
away from his work in London.

When her husband had quite disappeared Mary went into the house, and,
sitting down at the piano, gave an hour to Mendelssohn.

It was but a short walk across the common, and before the cigars
required renewing the two men had reached the gipsy camp. The place
was as picturesque as gipsy camps--when in villages and when business
is good--usually are. There were some few persons round the fire,
investing their money in prophecy, and a large number of others,
poorer or more parsimonious, who stayed just outside the bounds but
near enough to see all that went on.

As the two gentlemen approached, the villagers, who knew Joshua, made
way a little, and a pretty, keen-eyed gipsy girl tripped up and asked
to tell their fortunes. Joshua held out his hand, but the girl,
without seeming to see it, stared at his face in a very odd manner.
Gerald nudged him:

'You must cross her hand with silver,' he said. 'It is one of the most
important parts of the mystery.' Joshua took from his pocket a
half-crown and held it out to her, but, without looking at it, she
answered:

'You have to cross the gipsy's hand with gold.'

Gerald laughed. 'You are at a premium as a subject,' he said. Joshua
was of the kind of man--the universal kind--who can tolerate being
stared at by a pretty girl; so, with some little deliberation, he
answered:

'All right; here you are, my pretty girl; but you must give me a real
good fortune for it,' and he handed her a half sovereign, which she
took, saying:

'It is not for me to give good fortune or bad, but only to read what
the Stars have said.' She took his right hand and turned it palm
upward; but the instant her eyes met it she dropped it as though it
had been red hot, and, with a startled look, glided swiftly away.
Lifting the curtain of the large tent, which occupied the centre of
the camp, she disappeared within.

'Sold again!' said the cynical Gerald. Joshua stood a little amazed,
and not altogether satisfied. They both watched the large tent. In a
few moments there emerged from the opening not the young girl, but a
stately looking woman of middle age and commanding presence.

The instant she appeared the whole camp seemed to stand still. The
clamour of tongues, the laughter and noise of the work were, for a
second or two, arrested, and every man or woman who sat, or crouched,
or lay, stood up and faced the imperial looking gipsy.

'The Queen, of course,' murmured Gerald. 'We are in luck tonight.' The
gipsy Queen threw a searching glance around the camp, and then,
without hesitating an instant, came straight over and stood before
Joshua.

'Hold out your hand,' she said in a commanding tone.

Again Gerald spoke, _sotto voce_: 'I have not been spoken to in that
way since I was at school.'

'Your hand must be crossed with gold.'

'A hundred per cent. at this game,' whispered Gerald, as Joshua laid
another half sovereign on his upturned palm.

The gipsy looked at the hand with knitted brows; then suddenly looking
up into his face, said:

'Have you a strong will--have you a true heart that can be brave for
one you love?'

'I hope so; but I am afraid I have not vanity enough to say "yes".'

'Then I will answer for you; for I read resolution in your
face--resolution desperate and determined if need be. You have a wife
you love?'

'Yes,' emphatically.

'Then leave her at once--never see her face again. Go from her now,
while love is fresh and your heart is free from wicked intent. Go
quick--go far, and never see her face again!'

Joshua drew away his hand quickly, and said, 'Thank you!' stiffly but
sarcastically, as he began to move away.

'I say!' said Gerald, 'you're not going like that, old man; no use in
being indignant with the Stars or their prophet--and, moreover, your
sovereign--what of it? At least, hear the matter out.'

'Silence, ribald!' commanded the Queen, 'you know not what you do. Let
him go--and go ignorant, if he will not be warned.'

Joshua immediately turned back. 'At all events, we will see this thing
out,' he said. 'Now, madam, you have given me advice, but I paid for a
fortune.'

'Be warned!' said the gipsy. 'The Stars have been silent for long; let
the mystery still wrap them round.'

'My dear madam, I do not get within touch of a mystery every day, and
I prefer for my money knowledge rather than ignorance. I can get the
latter commodity for nothing when I want any of it.'

Gerald echoed the sentiment. 'As for me I have a large and unsaleable
stock on hand.'

The gipsy Queen eyed the two men sternly, and then said: 'As you wish.
You have chosen for yourself, and have met warning with scorn, and
appeal with levity. On your own heads be the doom!'

'Amen!' said Gerald.

With an imperious gesture the Queen took Joshua's hand again, and
began to tell his fortune.

'I see here the flowing of blood; it will flow before long; it is
running in my sight. It flows through the broken circle of a severed
ring.'

'Go on!' said Joshua, smiling. Gerald was silent.

'Must I speak plainer?'

'Certainly; we commonplace mortals want something definite. The Stars
are a long way off, and their words get somewhat dulled in the
message.'

The gipsy shuddered, and then spoke impressively. 'This is the hand of
a murderer--the murderer of his wife!' She dropped the hand and turned
away.

Joshua laughed. 'Do you know,' said he, 'I think if I were you I
should prophesy some jurisprudence into my system. For instance, you
say "this hand is the hand of a murderer." Well, whatever it may be in
the future--or potentially--it is at present not one. You ought to
give your prophecy in such terms as "the hand which will be a
murderer's", or, rather, "the hand of one who will be the murderer of
his wife". The Stars are really not good on technical questions.'

The gipsy made no reply of any kind, but, with drooping head and
despondent mien, walked slowly to her tent, and, lifting the curtain,
disappeared.

Without speaking the two men turned homewards, and walked across the
moor. Presently, after some little hesitation, Gerald spoke.

'Of course, old man, this is all a joke; a ghastly one, but still a
joke. But would it not be well to keep it to ourselves?'

'How do you mean?'

'Well, not tell your wife. It might alarm her.'

'Alarm her! My dear Gerald, what are you thinking of? Why, she would
not be alarmed or afraid of me if all the gipsies that ever didn't
come from Bohemia agreed that I was to murder her, or even to have a
hard thought of her, whilst so long as she was saying "Jack
Robinson."'

Gerald remonstrated. 'Old fellow, women are superstitious--far more
than we men are; and, also they are blessed--or cursed--with a nervous
system to which we are strangers. I see too much of it in my work not
to realise it. Take my advice and do not let her know, or you will
frighten her.'

Joshua's lips unconsciously hardened as he answered: 'My dear fellow,
I would not have a secret from my wife. Why, it would be the
beginning of a new order of things between us. We have no secrets from
each other. If we ever have, then you may begin to look out for
something odd between us.'

'Still,' said Gerald, 'at the risk of unwelcome interference, I say
again be warned in time.'

'The gipsy's very words,' said Joshua. 'You and she seem quite of one
accord. Tell me, old man, is this a put-up thing? You told me of the
gipsy camp--did you arrange it all with Her Majesty?' This was said
with an air of bantering earnestness. Gerald assured him that he only
heard of the camp that morning; but he made fun of every answer of his
friend, and, in the process of this raillery, the time passed, and
they entered the cottage.

Mary was sitting at the piano but not playing. The dim twilight had
waked some very tender feelings in her breast, and her eyes were full
of gentle tears. When the men came in she stole over to her husband's
side and kissed him. Joshua struck a tragic attitude.

'Mary,' he said in a deep voice, 'before you approach me, listen to
the words of Fate. The Stars have spoken and the doom is sealed.'

'What is it, dear? Tell me the fortune, but do not frighten me.'

'Not at all, my dear; but there is a truth which it is well that you
should know. Nay, it is necessary so that all your arrangements can be
made beforehand, and everything be decently done and in order.'

'Go on, dear; I am listening.'

'Mary Considine, your effigy may yet be seen at Madame Tussaud's. The
juris-imprudent Stars have announced their fell tidings that this hand
is red with blood--your blood. Mary! Mary! my God!' He sprang
forward, but too late to catch her as she fell fainting on the floor.

'I told you,' said Gerald. 'You don't know them as well as I do.'

After a little while Mary recovered from her swoon, but only to fall
into strong hysterics, in which she laughed and wept and raved and
cried, 'Keep him from me--from me, Joshua, my husband,' and many other
words of entreaty and of fear.

Joshua Considine was in a state of mind bordering on agony, and when
at last Mary became calm he knelt by her and kissed her feet and hands
and hair and called her all the sweet names and said all the tender
things his lips could frame. All that night he sat by her bedside and
held her hand. Far through the night and up to the early morning she
kept waking from sleep and crying out as if in fear, till she was
comforted by the consciousness that her husband was watching beside
her.

Breakfast was late the next morning, but during it Joshua received a
telegram which required him to drive over to Withering, nearly twenty
miles. He was loth to go; but Mary would not hear of his remaining,
and so before noon he drove off in his dog-cart alone.

When he was gone Mary retired to her room. She did not appear at
lunch, but when afternoon tea was served on the lawn under the great
weeping willow, she came to join her guest. She was looking quite
recovered from her illness of the evening before. After some casual
remarks, she said to Gerald: 'Of course it was very silly about last
night, but I could not help feeling frightened. Indeed I would feel so
still if I let myself think of it. But, after all these people may
only imagine things, and I have got a test that can hardly fail to
show that the prediction is false--if indeed it be false,' she added
sadly.

'What is your plan?' asked Gerald.

'I shall go myself to the gipsy camp, and have my fortune told by the
Queen.'

'Capital. May I go with you?'

'Oh, no! That would spoil it. She might know you and guess at me, and
suit her utterance accordingly. I shall go alone this afternoon.'

When the afternoon was gone Mary Considine took her way to the gipsy
encampment. Gerald went with her as far as the near edge of the
common, and returned alone.

Half-an-hour had hardly elapsed when Mary entered the drawing-room,
where he lay on a sofa reading. She was ghastly pale and was in a
state of extreme excitement. Hardly had she passed over the threshold
when she collapsed and sank moaning on the carpet. Gerald rushed to
aid her, but by a great effort she controlled herself and motioned him
to be silent. He waited, and his ready attention to her wish seemed to
be her best help, for, in a few minutes, she had somewhat recovered,
and was able to tell him what had passed.

'When I got to the camp,' she said, 'there did not seem to be a soul
about, I went into the centre and stood there. Suddenly a tall woman
stood beside me. "Something told me I was wanted!" she said. I held
out my hand and laid a piece of silver on it. She took from her neck a
small golden trinket and laid it there also; and then, seizing the
two, threw them into the stream that ran by. Then she took my hand in
hers and spoke: "Naught but blood in this guilty place," and turned
away. I caught hold of her and asked her to tell me more. After some
hesitation, she said: "Alas! alas! I see you lying at your husband's
feet, and his hands are red with blood."'

Gerald did not feel at all at ease, and tried to laugh it off.
'Surely,' he said, 'this woman has a craze about murder.'

'Do not laugh,' said Mary, 'I cannot bear it,' and then, as if with a
sudden impulse, she left the room.

Not long after Joshua returned, bright and cheery, and as hungry as a
hunter after his long drive. His presence cheered his wife, who seemed
much brighter, but she did not mention the episode of the visit to the
gipsy camp, so Gerald did not mention it either. As if by tacit
consent the subject was not alluded to during the evening. But there
was a strange, settled look on Mary's face, which Gerald could not but
observe.

In the morning Joshua came down to breakfast later than usual. Mary
had been up and about the house from an early hour; but as the time
drew on she seemed to get a little nervous and now and again threw
around an anxious look.

Gerald could not help noticing that none of those at breakfast could
get on satisfactorily with their food. It was not altogether that the
chops were tough, but that the knives were all so blunt. Being a
guest, he, of course, made no sign; but presently saw Joshua draw his
thumb across the edge of his knife in an unconscious sort of way. At
the action Mary turned pale and almost fainted.

After breakfast they all went out on the lawn. Mary was making up a
bouquet, and said to her husband, 'Get me a few of the tea-roses,
dear.'

Joshua pulled down a cluster from the front of the house. The stem
bent, but was too tough to break. He put his hand in his pocket to get
his knife; but in vain. 'Lend me your knife, Gerald,' he said. But
Gerald had not got one, so he went into the breakfast room and took
one from the table. He came out feeling its edge and grumbling. 'What
on earth has happened to all the knives--the edges seem all ground
off?' Mary turned away hurriedly and entered the house.

Joshua tried to sever the stalk with the blunt knife as country cooks
sever the necks of fowl--as schoolboys cut twine. With a little effort
he finished the task. The cluster of roses grew thick, so he
determined to gather a great bunch.

He could not find a single sharp knife in the sideboard where the
cutlery was kept, so he called Mary, and when she came, told her the
state of things. She looked so agitated and so miserable that he could
not help knowing the truth, and, as if astounded and hurt, asked her:

'Do you mean to say that _you_ have done it?'

She broke in, 'Oh, Joshua, I was so afraid.'

He paused, and a set, white look came over his face. 'Mary!' said he,
'is this all the trust you have in me? I would not have believed it.'

'Oh, Joshua! Joshua!' she cried entreatingly, 'forgive me,' and wept
bitterly.

Joshua thought a moment and then said: 'I see how it is. We shall
better end this or we shall all go mad.'

He ran into the drawing-room.

'Where are you going?' almost screamed Mary.

Gerald saw what he meant--that he would not be tied to blunt
instruments by the force of a superstition, and was not surprised when
he saw him come out through the French window, bearing in his hand a
large Ghourka knife, which usually lay on the centre table, and which
his brother had sent him from Northern India. It was one of those
great hunting-knives which worked such havoc, at close quarters with
the enemies of the loyal Ghourkas during the mutiny, of great weight
but so evenly balanced in the hand as to seem light, and with an edge
like a razor. With one of these knives a Ghourka can cut a sheep in
two.

When Mary saw him come out of the room with the weapon in his hand she
screamed in an agony of fright, and the hysterics of last night were
promptly renewed.

Joshua ran toward her, and, seeing her falling, threw down the knife
and tried to catch her.

However, he was just a second too late, and the two men cried out in
horror simultaneously as they saw her fall upon the naked blade.

When Gerald rushed over he found that in falling her left hand had
struck the blade, which lay partly upwards on the grass. Some of the
small veins were cut through, and the blood gushed freely from the
wound. As he was tying it up he pointed out to Joshua that the wedding
ring was severed by the steel.

They carried her fainting to the house. When, after a while, she came
out, with her arm in a sling, she was peaceful in her mind and happy.
She said to her husband:

'The gipsy was wonderfully near the truth; too near for the real thing
ever to occur now, dear.'

Joshua bent over and kissed the wounded hand.




The Coming of Abel Behenna


The little Cornish port of Pencastle was bright in the early April,
when the sun had seemingly come to stay after a long and bitter
winter. Boldly and blackly the rock stood out against a background of
shaded blue, where the sky fading into mist met the far horizon. The
sea was of true Cornish hue--sapphire, save where it became deep
emerald green in the fathomless depths under the cliffs, where the
seal caves opened their grim jaws. On the slopes the grass was parched
and brown. The spikes of furze bushes were ashy grey, but the golden
yellow of their flowers streamed along the hillside, dipping out in
lines as the rock cropped up, and lessening into patches and dots till
finally it died away all together where the sea winds swept round the
jutting cliffs and cut short the vegetation as though with an
ever-working aerial shears. The whole hillside, with its body of brown
and flashes of yellow, was just like a colossal yellow-hammer.

The little harbour opened from the sea between towering cliffs, and
behind a lonely rock, pierced with many caves and blow-holes through
which the sea in storm time sent its thunderous voice, together with a
fountain of drifting spume. Hence, it wound westwards in a serpentine
course, guarded at its entrance by two little curving piers to left
and right. These were roughly built of dark slates placed endways and
held together with great beams bound with iron bands. Thence, it
flowed up the rocky bed of the stream whose winter torrents had of old
cut out its way amongst the hills. This stream was deep at first, with
here and there, where it widened, patches of broken rock exposed at
low water, full of holes where crabs and lobsters were to be found at
the ebb of the tide. From amongst the rocks rose sturdy posts, used
for warping in the little coasting vessels which frequented the port.
Higher up, the stream still flowed deeply, for the tide ran far
inland, but always calmly for all the force of the wildest storm was
broken below. Some quarter mile inland the stream was deep at high
water, but at low tide there were at each side patches of the same
broken rock as lower down, through the chinks of which the sweet water
of the natural stream trickled and murmured after the tide had ebbed
away. Here, too, rose mooring posts for the fishermen's boats. At
either side of the river was a row of cottages down almost on the
level of high tide. They were pretty cottages, strongly and snugly
built, with trim narrow gardens in front, full of old-fashioned
plants, flowering currants, coloured primroses, wallflower, and
stonecrop. Over the fronts of many of them climbed clematis and
wisteria. The window sides and door posts of all were as white as
snow, and the little pathway to each was paved with light coloured
stones. At some of the doors were tiny porches, whilst at others were
rustic seats cut from tree trunks or from old barrels; in nearly every
case the window ledges were filled with boxes or pots of flowers or
foliage plants.

Two men lived in cottages exactly opposite each other across the
stream. Two men, both young, both good-looking, both prosperous, and
who had been companions and rivals from their boyhood. Abel Behenna
was dark with the gypsy darkness which the Phoenician mining wanderers
left in their track; Eric Sanson--which the local antiquarian said was
a corruption of Sagamanson--was fair, with the ruddy hue which marked
the path of the wild Norseman. These two seemed to have singled out
each other from the very beginning to work and strive together, to
fight for each other and to stand back to back in all endeavours. They
had now put the coping-stone on their Temple of Unity by falling in
love with the same girl. Sarah Trefusis was certainly the prettiest
girl in Pencastle, and there was many a young man who would gladly
have tried his fortune with her, but that there were two to contend
against, and each of these the strongest and most resolute man in the
port--except the other. The average young man thought that this was
very hard, and on account of it bore no good will to either of the
three principals: whilst the average young woman who had, lest worse
should befall, to put up with the grumbling of her sweetheart, and the
sense of being only second best which it implied, did not either, be
sure, regard Sarah with friendly eye. Thus it came, in the course of a
year or so, for rustic courtship is a slow process, that the two men
and woman found themselves thrown much together. They were all
satisfied, so it did not matter, and Sarah, who was vain and something
frivolous, took care to have her revenge on both men and women in a
quiet way. When a young woman in her 'walking out' can only boast one
not-quite-satisfied young man, it is no particular pleasure to her to
see her escort cast sheep's eyes at a better-looking girl supported by
two devoted swains.

At length there came a time which Sarah dreaded, and which she had
tried to keep distant--the time when she had to make her choice
between the two men. She liked them both, and, indeed, either of them
might have satisfied the ideas of even a more exacting girl. But her
mind was so constituted that she thought more of what she might lose,
than of what she might gain; and whenever she thought she had made up
her mind she became instantly assailed with doubts as to the wisdom of
her choice. Always the man whom she had presumably lost became endowed
afresh with a newer and more bountiful crop of advantages than had
ever arisen from the possibility of his acceptance. She promised each
man that on her birthday she would give him his answer, and that day,
the 11th of April, had now arrived. The promises had been given singly
and confidentially, but each was given to a man who was not likely to
forget. Early in the morning she found both men hovering round her
door. Neither had taken the other into his confidence, and each was
simply seeking an early opportunity of getting his answer, and
advancing his suit if necessary. Damon, as a rule, does not take
Pythias with him when making a proposal; and in the heart of each man
his own affairs had a claim far above any requirements of friendship.
So, throughout the day, they kept seeing each other out. The position
was doubtless somewhat embarrassing to Sarah, and though the
satisfaction of her vanity that she should be thus adored was very
pleasing, yet there were moments when she was annoyed with both men
for being so persistent. Her only consolation at such moments was that
she saw, through the elaborate smiles of the other girls when in
passing they noticed her door thus doubly guarded, the jealousy which
filled their hearts. Sarah's mother was a person of commonplace and
sordid ideas, and, seeing all along the state of affairs, her one
intention, persistently expressed to her daughter in the plainest
words, was to so arrange matters that Sarah should get all that was
possible out of both men. With this purpose she had cunningly kept
herself as far as possible in the background in the matter of her
daughter's wooings, and watched in silence. At first Sarah had been
indignant with her for her sordid views; but, as usual, her weak
nature gave way before persistence, and she had now got to the stage
of acceptance. She was not surprised when her mother whispered to her
in the little yard behind the house:--

'Go up the hillside for a while; I want to talk to these two. They're
both red-hot for ye, and now's the time to get things fixed!' Sarah
began a feeble remonstrance, but her mother cut her short.

'I tell ye, girl, that my mind is made up! Both these men want ye, and
only one can have ye, but before ye choose it'll be so arranged that
ye'll have all that both have got! Don't argy, child! Go up the
hillside, and when ye come back I'll have it fixed--I see a way quite
easy!' So Sarah went up the hillside through the narrow paths between
the golden furze, and Mrs. Trefusis joined the two men in the
living-room of the little house.

She opened the attack with the desperate courage which is in all
mothers when they think for their children, howsoever mean the
thoughts may be.

'Ye two men, ye're both in love with my Sarah!'

Their bashful silence gave consent to the barefaced proposition. She
went on.

'Neither of ye has much!' Again they tacitly acquiesced in the soft
impeachment.

'I don't know that either of ye could keep a wife!' Though neither
said a word their looks and bearing expressed distinct dissent. Mrs.
Trefusis went on:

'But if ye'd put what ye both have together ye'd make a comfortable
home for one of ye--and Sarah!' She eyed the men keenly, with her
cunning eyes half shut, as she spoke; then satisfied from her scrutiny
that the idea was accepted she went on quickly, as if to prevent
argument:

'The girl likes ye both, and mayhap it's hard for her to choose. Why
don't ye toss up for her? First put your money together--ye've each
got a bit put by, I know. Let the lucky man take the lot and trade
with it a bit, and then come home and marry her. Neither of ye's
afraid, I suppose! And neither of ye'll say that he won't do that much
for the girl that ye both say ye love!'

Abel broke the silence:

'It don't seem the square thing to toss for the girl! She wouldn't
like it herself, and it doesn't seem--seem respectful like to her--'
Eric interrupted. He was conscious that his chance was not so good as
Abel's in case Sarah should wish to choose between them:

'Are ye afraid of the hazard?'

'Not me!' said Abel, boldly. Mrs. Trefusis, seeing that her idea was
beginning to work, followed up the advantage.

'It is settled that ye put yer money together to make a home for her,
whether ye toss for her or leave it for her to choose?'

'Yes,' said Eric quickly, and Abel agreed with equal sturdiness. Mrs.
Trefusis' little cunning eyes twinkled. She heard Sarah's step in the
yard, and said:

'Well! here she comes, and I leave it to her.' And she went out.

During her brief walk on the hillside Sarah had been trying to make up
her mind. She was feeling almost angry with both men for being the
cause of her difficulty, and as she came into the room said shortly:

'I want to have a word with you both--come to the Flagstaff Rock,
where we can be alone.' She took her hat and went out of the house up
the winding path to the steep rock crowned with a high flagstaff,
where once the wreckers' fire basket used to burn. This was the rock
which formed the northern jaw of the little harbour. There was only
room on the path for two abreast, and it marked the state of things
pretty well when, by a sort of implied arrangement, Sarah went first,
and the two men followed, walking abreast and keeping step. By this
time, each man's heart was boiling with jealousy. When they came to
the top of the rock, Sarah stood against the flagstaff, and the two
young men stood opposite her. She had chosen her position with
knowledge and intention, for there was no room for anyone to stand
beside her. They were all silent for a while; then Sarah began to
laugh and said:--

'I promised the both of you to give you an answer to-day. I've been
thinking and thinking and thinking, till I began to get angry with you
both for plaguing me so; and even now I don't seem any nearer than
ever I was to making up my mind.' Eric said suddenly:

'Let us toss for it, lass!' Sarah showed no indignation whatever at
the proposition; her mother's eternal suggestion had schooled her to
the acceptance of something of the kind, and her weak nature made it
easy to her to grasp at any way out of the difficulty. She stood with
downcast eyes idly picking at the sleeve of her dress, seeming to
have tacitly acquiesced in the proposal. Both men instinctively
realising this pulled each a coin from his pocket, spun it in the air,
and dropped his other hand over the palm on which it lay. For a few
seconds they remained thus, all silent; then Abel, who was the more
thoughtful of the men, spoke:

'Sarah! is this good?' As he spoke he removed the upper hand from the
coin and placed the latter back in his pocket. Sarah was nettled.

'Good or bad, it's good enough for me! Take it or leave it as you
like,' she said, to which he replied quickly:

'Nay lass! Aught that concerns you is good enow for me. I did but
think of you lest you might have pain or disappointment hereafter. If
you love Eric better nor me, in God's name say so, and I think I'm man
enow to stand aside. Likewise, if I'm the one, don't make us both
miserable for life!' Face to face with a difficulty, Sarah's weak
nature proclaimed itself; she put her hands before her face and began
to cry, saying--

'It was my mother. She keeps telling me!' The silence which followed
was broken by Eric, who said hotly to Abel:

'Let the lass alone, can't you? If she wants to choose this way, let
her. It's good enough for me--and for you, too! She's said it now, and
must abide by it!' Hereupon Sarah turned upon him in sudden fury, and
cried:

'Hold your tongue! what is it to you, at any rate?' and she resumed
her crying. Eric was so flabbergasted that he had not a word to say,
but stood looking particularly foolish, with his mouth open and his
hands held out with the coin still between them. All were silent till
Sarah, taking her hands from her face laughed hysterically and said:

'As you two can't make up your minds, I'm going home!' and she turned
to go.

'Stop,' said Abel, in an authoritative voice. 'Eric, you hold the
coin, and I'll cry. Now, before we settle it, let us clearly
understand: the man who wins takes all the money that we both have
got, brings it to Bristol and ships on a voyage and trades with it.
Then he comes back and marries Sarah, and they two keep all, whatever
there may be, as the result of the trading. Is this what we
understand?'

'Yes,' said Eric.

'I'll marry him on my next birthday,' said Sarah. Having said it the
intolerably mercenary spirit of her action seemed to strike her, and
impulsively she turned away with a bright blush. Fire seemed to
sparkle in the eyes of both men. Said Eric: 'A year so be! The man
that wins is to have one year.'

'Toss!' cried Abel, and the coin spun in the air. Eric caught it, and
again held it between his outstretched hands.

'Heads!' cried Abel, a pallor sweeping over his face as he spoke. As
he leaned forward to look Sarah leaned forward too, and their heads
almost touched. He could feel her hair blowing on his cheek, and it
thrilled through him like fire. Eric lifted his upper hand; the coin
lay with its head up. Abel stepped forward and took Sarah in his arms.
With a curse Eric hurled the coin far into the sea. Then he leaned
against the flagstaff and scowled at the others with his hands thrust
deep into his pockets. Abel whispered wild words of passion and
delight into Sarah's ears, and as she listened she began to believe
that fortune had rightly interpreted the wishes of her secret heart,
and that she loved Abel best.

Presently Abel looked up and caught sight of Eric's face as the last
ray of sunset struck it. The red light intensified the natural
ruddiness of his complexion, and he looked as though he were steeped
in blood. Abel did not mind his scowl, for now that his own heart was
at rest he could feel unalloyed pity for his friend. He stepped over
meaning to comfort him, and held out his hand, saying:

'It was my chance, old lad. Don't grudge it me. I'll try to make Sarah
a happy woman, and you shall be a brother to us both!'

'Brother be damned!' was all the answer Eric made, as he turned away.
When he had gone a few steps down the rocky path he turned and came
back. Standing before Abel and Sarah, who had their arms round each
other, he said:

'You have a year. Make the most of it! And be sure you're in time to
claim your wife! Be back to have your banns up in time to be married
on the 11th April. If you're not, I tell you I shall have my banns up,
and you may get back too late.'

'What do you mean, Eric? You are mad!'

'No more mad than you are, Abel Behenna. You go, that's your chance! I
stay, that's mine! I don't mean to let the grass grow under my feet.
Sarah cared no more for you than for me five minutes ago, and she may
come back to that five minutes after you're gone! You won by a point
only--the game may change.'

'The game won't change!' said Abel shortly. 'Sarah, you'll be true to
me? You won't marry till I return?'

'For a year!' added Eric, quickly, 'that's the bargain.'

'I promise for the year,' said Sarah. A dark look came over Abel's
face, and he was about to speak, but he mastered himself and smiled.

'I mustn't be too hard or get angry tonight! Come, Eric! we played and
fought together. I won fairly. I played fairly all the game of our
wooing! You know that as well as I do; and now when I am going away, I
shall look to my old and true comrade to help me when I am gone!'

'I'll help you none,' said Eric, 'so help me God!'

'It was God helped me,' said Abel simply.

'Then let Him go on helping you,' said Eric angrily. 'The Devil is
good enough for me!' and without another word he rushed down the steep
path and disappeared behind the rocks.

When he had gone Abel hoped for some tender passage with Sarah, but
the first remark she made chilled him.

'How lonely it all seems without Eric!' and this note sounded till he
had left her at home--and after.

Early on the next morning Abel heard a noise at his door, and on going
out saw Eric walking rapidly away: a small canvas bag full of gold and
silver lay on the threshold; on a small slip of paper pinned to it was
written:

'Take the money and go. I stay. God for you! The Devil for me!
Remember the 11th of April.--ERIC SANSON.' That afternoon Abel went
off to Bristol, and a week later sailed on the _Star of the Sea_ bound
for Pahang. His money--including that which had been Eric's--was on
board in the shape of a venture of cheap toys. He had been advised by
a shrewd old mariner of Bristol whom he knew, and who knew the ways of
the Chersonese, who predicted that every penny invested would be
returned with a shilling to boot.

As the year wore on Sarah became more and more disturbed in her mind.
Eric was always at hand to make love to her in his own persistent,
masterful manner, and to this she did not object. Only one letter came
from Abel, to say that his venture had proved successful, and that he
had sent some two hundred pounds to the bank at Bristol, and was
trading with fifty pounds still remaining in goods for China, whither
the _Star of the Sea_ was bound and whence she would return to
Bristol. He suggested that Eric's share of the venture should be
returned to him with his share of the profits. This proposition was
treated with anger by Eric, and as simply childish by Sarah's mother.

More than six months had since then elapsed, but no other letter had
come, and Eric's hopes which had been dashed down by the letter from
Pahang, began to rise again. He perpetually assailed Sarah with an
'if!' If Abel did not return, would she then marry him? If the 11th
April went by without Abel being in the port, would she give him over?
If Abel had taken his fortune, and married another girl on the head of
it, would she marry him, Eric, as soon as the truth were known? And so
on in an endless variety of possibilities. The power of the strong
will and the determined purpose over the woman's weaker nature became
in time manifest. Sarah began to lose her faith in Abel and to regard
Eric as a possible husband; and a possible husband is in a woman's eye
different to all other men. A new affection for him began to arise in
her breast, and the daily familiarities of permitted courtship
furthered the growing affection. Sarah began to regard Abel as rather
a rock in the road of her life, and had it not been for her mother's
constantly reminding her of the good fortune already laid by in the
Bristol Bank she would have tried to have shut her eyes altogether to
the fact of Abel's existence.

The 11th April was Saturday, so that in order to have the marriage on
that day it would be necessary that the banns should be called on
Sunday, 22nd March. From the beginning of that month Eric kept
perpetually on the subject of Abel's absence, and his outspoken
opinion that the latter was either dead or married began to become a
reality to the woman's mind. As the first half of the month wore on
Eric became more jubilant, and after church on the 15th he took Sarah
for a walk to the Flagstaff Rock. There he asserted himself strongly:

'I told Abel, and you too, that if he was not here to put up his banns
in time for the eleventh, I would put up mine for the twelfth. Now the
time has come when I mean to do it. He hasn't kept his word'--here
Sarah struck in out of her weakness and indecision:

'He hasn't broken it yet!' Eric ground his teeth with anger.

'If you mean to stick up for him,' he said, as he smote his hands
savagely on the flagstaff, which sent forth a shivering murmur, 'well
and good. I'll keep my part of the bargain. On Sunday I shall give
notice of the banns, and you can deny them in the church if you will.
If Abel is in Pencastle on the eleventh, he can have them cancelled,
and his own put up; but till then, I take my course, and woe to anyone
who stands in my way!' With that he flung himself down the rocky
pathway, and Sarah could not but admire his Viking strength and
spirit, as, crossing the hill, he strode away along the cliffs towards
Bude.

During the week no news was heard of Abel, and on Saturday Eric gave
notice of the banns of marriage between himself and Sarah Trefusis.
The clergyman would have remonstrated with him, for although nothing
formal had been told to the neighbours, it had been understood since
Abel's departure that on his return he was to marry Sarah; but Eric
would not discuss the question.

'It is a painful subject, sir,' he said with a firmness which the
parson, who was a very young man, could not but be swayed by. 'Surely
there is nothing against Sarah or me. Why should there be any bones
made about the matter?' The parson said no more, and on the next day
he read out the banns for the first time amidst an audible buzz from
the congregation. Sarah was present, contrary to custom, and though
she blushed furiously enjoyed her triumph over the other girls whose
banns had not yet come. Before the week was over she began to make her
wedding dress. Eric used to come and look at her at work and the sight
thrilled through him. He used to say all sorts of pretty things to her
at such times, and there were to both delicious moments of
love-making.

The banns were read a second time on the 29th, and Eric's hope grew
more and more fixed though there were to him moments of acute despair
when he realised that the cup of happiness might be dashed from his
lips at any moment, right up to the last. At such times he was full of
passion--desperate and remorseless--and he ground his teeth and
clenched his hands in a wild way as though some taint of the old
Berserker fury of his ancestors still lingered in his blood. On the
Thursday of that week he looked in on Sarah and found her, amid a
flood of sunshine, putting finishing touches to her white wedding
gown. His own heart was full of gaiety, and the sight of the woman who
was so soon to be his own so occupied, filled him with a joy
unspeakable, and he felt faint with languorous ecstasy. Bending over
he kissed Sarah on the mouth, and then whispered in her rosy ear--

'Your wedding dress, Sarah! And for me!' As he drew back to admire her
she looked up saucily, and said to him--

'Perhaps not for you. There is more than a week yet for Abel!' and
then cried out in dismay, for with a wild gesture and a fierce oath
Eric dashed out of the house, banging the door behind him. The
incident disturbed Sarah more than she could have thought possible,
for it awoke all her fears and doubts and indecision afresh. She cried
a little, and put by her dress, and to soothe herself went out to sit
for a while on the summit of the Flagstaff Rock. When she arrived she
found there a little group anxiously discussing the weather. The sea
was calm and the sun bright, but across the sea were strange lines of
darkness and light, and close in to shore the rocks were fringed with
foam, which spread out in great white curves and circles as the
currents drifted. The wind had backed, and came in sharp, cold puffs.
The blow-hole, which ran under the Flagstaff Rock, from the rocky bay
without to the harbour within, was booming at intervals, and the
seagulls were screaming ceaselessly as they wheeled about the entrance
of the port.

'It looks bad,' she heard an old fisherman say to the coastguard. 'I
seen it just like this once before, when the East Indiaman
_Coromandel_ went to pieces in Dizzard Bay!' Sarah did not wait to
hear more. She was of a timid nature where danger was concerned, and
could not bear to hear of wrecks and disasters. She went home and
resumed the completion of her dress, secretly determined to appease
Eric when she should meet him with a sweet apology--and to take the
earliest opportunity of being even with him after her marriage. The
old fisherman's weather prophecy was justified. That night at dusk a
wild storm came on. The sea rose and lashed the western coasts from
Skye to Scilly and left a tale of disaster everywhere. The sailors and
fishermen of Pencastle all turned out on the rocks and cliffs and
watched eagerly. Presently, by a flash of lightning, a 'ketch' was
seen drifting under only a jib about half-a-mile outside the port. All
eyes and all glasses were concentrated on her, waiting for the next
flash, and when it came a chorus went up that it was the _Lovely
Alice_, trading between Bristol and Penzance, and touching at all the
little ports between. 'God help them!' said the harbour-master, 'for
nothing in this world can save them when they are between Bude and
Tintagel and the wind on shore!' The coastguards exerted themselves,
and, aided by brave hearts and willing hands, they brought the rocket
apparatus up on the summit of the Flagstaff Rock. Then they burned
blue lights so that those on board might see the harbour opening in
case they could make any effort to reach it. They worked gallantly
enough on board; but no skill or strength of man could avail. Before
many minutes were over the _Lovely Alice_ rushed to her doom on the
great island rock that guarded the mouth of the port. The screams of
those on board were faintly borne on the tempest as they flung
themselves into the sea in a last chance for life. The blue lights
were kept burning, and eager eyes peered into the depths of the waters
in case any face could be seen; and ropes were held ready to fling out
in aid. But never a face was seen, and the willing arms rested idle.
Eric was there amongst his fellows. His old Icelandic origin was
never more apparent than in that wild hour. He took a rope, and
shouted in the ear of the harbour-master:

'I shall go down on the rock over the seal cave. The tide is running
up, and someone may drift in there!'

'Keep back, man!' came the answer. 'Are you mad? One slip on that rock
and you are lost: and no man could keep his feet in the dark on such a
place in such a tempest!'

'Not a bit,' came the reply. 'You remember how Abel Behenna saved me
there on a night like this when my boat went on the Gull Rock. He
dragged me up from the deep water in the seal cave, and now someone
may drift in there again as I did,' and he was gone into the darkness.
The projecting rock hid the light on the Flagstaff Rock, but he knew
his way too well to miss it. His boldness and sureness of foot
standing to him, he shortly stood on the great round-topped rock cut
away beneath by the action of the waves over the entrance of the seal
cave, where the water was fathomless. There he stood in comparative
safety, for the concave shape of the rock beat back the waves with
their own force, and though the water below him seemed to boil like a
seething cauldron, just beyond the spot there was a space of almost
calm. The rock, too, seemed here to shut off the sound of the gale,
and he listened as well as watched. As he stood there ready, with his
coil of rope poised to throw, he thought he heard below him, just
beyond the whirl of the water, a faint, despairing cry. He echoed it
with a shout that rang into the night. Then he waited for the flash of
lightning, and as it passed flung his rope out into the darkness where
he had seen a face rising through the swirl of the foam. The rope was
caught, for he felt a pull on it, and he shouted again in his mighty
voice:

'Tie it round your waist, and I shall pull you up.' Then when he felt
that it was fast he moved along the rock to the far side of the sea
cave, where the deep water was something stiller, and where he could
get foothold secure enough to drag the rescued man on the overhanging
rock. He began to pull, and shortly he knew from the rope taken in
that the man he was now rescuing must soon be close to the top of the
rock. He steadied himself for a moment, and drew a long breath, that
he might at the next effort complete the rescue. He had just bent his
back to the work when a flash of lightning revealed to each other the
two men--the rescuer and the rescued.

Eric Sanson and Abel Behenna were face to face--and none knew of the
meeting save themselves; and God.

On the instant a wave of passion swept through Eric's heart. All his
hopes were shattered, and with the hatred of Cain his eyes looked out.
He saw in the instant of recognition the joy in Abel's face that his
was the hand to succour him, and this intensified his hate. Whilst the
passion was on him he started back, and the rope ran out between his
hands. His moment of hate was followed by an impulse of his better
manhood, but it was too late.

Before he could recover himself, Abel encumbered with the rope that
should have aided him, was plunged with a despairing cry back into the
darkness of the devouring sea.

Then, feeling all the madness and the doom of Cain upon him, Eric
rushed back over the rocks, heedless of the danger and eager only for
one thing--to be amongst other people whose living noises would shut
out that last cry which seemed to ring still in his ears. When he
regained the Flagstaff Rock the men surrounded him, and through the
fury of the storm he heard the harbour-master say:--

'We feared you were lost when we heard a cry! How white you are! Where
is your rope? Was there anyone drifted in?'

'No one,' he shouted in answer, for he felt that he could never
explain that he had let his old comrade slip back into the sea, and at
the very place and under the very circumstances in which that comrade
had saved his own life. He hoped by one bold lie to set the matter at
rest for ever. There was no one to bear witness--and if he should have
to carry that still white face in his eyes and that despairing cry in
his ears for evermore--at least none should know of it. 'No one,' he
cried, more loudly still. 'I slipped on the rock, and the rope fell
into the sea!' So saying he left them, and, rushing down the steep
path, gained his own cottage and locked himself within.

The remainder of that night he passed lying on his bed--dressed and
motionless--staring upwards, and seeming to see through the darkness a
pale face gleaming wet in the lightning, with its glad recognition
turning to ghastly despair, and to hear a cry which never ceased to
echo in his soul.

In the morning the storm was over and all was smiling again, except
that the sea was still boisterous with its unspent fury. Great pieces
of wreck drifted into the port, and the sea around the island rock was
strewn with others. Two bodies also drifted into the harbour--one the
master of the wrecked ketch, the other a strange seaman whom no one
knew.

Sarah saw nothing of Eric till the evening, and then he only looked
in for a minute. He did not come into the house, but simply put his
head in through the open window.

'Well, Sarah,' he called out in a loud voice, though to her it did not
ring truly, 'is the wedding dress done? Sunday week, mind! Sunday
week!'

Sarah was glad to have the reconciliation so easy; but, womanlike,
when she saw the storm was over and her own fears groundless, she at
once repeated the cause of offence.

'Sunday so be it,' she said without looking up, 'if Abel isn't there
on Saturday!' Then she looked up saucily, though her heart was full of
fear of another outburst on the part of her impetuous lover. But the
window was empty; Eric had taken himself off, and with a pout she
resumed her work. She saw Eric no more till Sunday afternoon, after
the banns had been called the third time, when he came up to her
before all the people with an air of proprietorship which half-pleased
and half-annoyed her.

'Not yet, mister!' she said, pushing him away, as the other girls
giggled. 'Wait till Sunday next, if you please--the day after
Saturday!' she added, looking at him saucily. The girls giggled again,
and the young men guffawed. They thought it was the snub that touched
him so that he became as white as a sheet as he turned away. But
Sarah, who knew more than they did, laughed, for she saw triumph
through the spasm of pain that overspread his face.

The week passed uneventfully; however, as Saturday drew nigh Sarah had
occasional moments of anxiety, and as to Eric he went about at
night-time like a man possessed. He restrained himself when others
were by, but now and again he went down amongst the rocks and caves
and shouted aloud. This seemed to relieve him somewhat, and he was
better able to restrain himself for some time after. All Saturday he
stayed in his own house and never left it. As he was to be married on
the morrow, the neighbours thought it was shyness on his part, and did
not trouble or notice him. Only once was he disturbed, and that was
when the chief boatman came to him and sat down, and after a pause
said:

'Eric, I was over in Bristol yesterday. I was in the ropemaker's
getting a coil to replace the one you lost the night of the storm, and
there I saw Michael Heavens of this place, who is a salesman there. He
told me that Abel Behenna had come home the week ere last on the _Star
of the Sea_ from Canton, and that he had lodged a sight of money in
the Bristol Bank in the name of Sarah Behenna. He told Michael so
himself--and that he had taken passage on the _Lovely Alice_ to
Pencastle. 'Bear up, man,' for Eric had with a groan dropped his head
on his knees, with his face between his hands. 'He was your old
comrade, I know, but you couldn't help him. He must have gone down
with the rest that awful night. I thought I'd better tell you, lest it
might come some other way, and you might keep Sarah Trefusis from
being frightened. They were good friends once, and women take these
things to heart. It would not do to let her be pained with such a
thing on her wedding day!' Then he rose and went away, leaving Eric
still sitting disconsolately with his head on his knees.

'Poor fellow!' murmured the chief boatman to himself; 'he takes it to
heart. Well, well! right enough! They were true comrades once, and
Abel saved him!'

The afternoon of that day, when the children had left school, they
strayed as usual on half-holidays along' the quay and the paths by the
cliffs. Presently some of them came running in a state of great
excitement to the harbour, where a few men were unloading a coal
ketch, and a great many were superintending the operation. One of the
children called out:

'There is a porpoise in the harbour mouth! We saw it come through the
blow-hole! It had a long tail, and was deep under the water!'

'It was no porpoise,' said another; 'it was a seal; but it had a long
tail! It came out of the seal cave!' The other children bore various
testimony, but on two points they were unanimous--it, whatever 'it'
was, had come through the blow-hole deep under the water, and had a
long, thin tail--a tail so long that they could not see the end of it.
There was much unmerciful chaffing of the children by the men on this
point, but as it was evident that they had seen something, quite a
number of persons, young and old, male and female, went along the high
paths on either side of the harbour mouth to catch a glimpse of this
new addition to the fauna of the sea, a long-tailed porpoise or seal.
The tide was now coming in. There was a slight breeze, and the surface
of the water was rippled so that it was only at moments that anyone
could see clearly into the deep water. After a spell of watching a
woman called out that she saw something moving up the channel, just
below where she was standing. There was a stampede to the spot, but by
the time the crowd had gathered the breeze had freshened, and it was
impossible to see with any distinctness below the surface of the
water. On being questioned the woman described what she had seen, but
in such an incoherent way that the whole thing was put down as an
effect of imagination; had it not been for the children's report she
would not have been credited at all. Her semi-hysterical statement
that what she saw was 'like a pig with the entrails out' was only
thought anything of by an old coastguard, who shook his head but did
not make any remark. For the remainder of the daylight this man was
seen always on the bank, looking into the water, but always with
disappointment manifest on his face.

Eric arose early on the next morning--he had not slept all night, and
it was a relief to him to move about in the light. He shaved himself
with a hand that did not tremble, and dressed himself in his wedding
clothes. There was a haggard look on his face, and he seemed as though
he had grown years older in the last few days. Still there was a wild,
uneasy light of triumph in his eyes, and he kept murmuring to himself
over and over again:

'This is my wedding-day! Abel cannot claim her now--living or
dead!--living or dead! Living or dead!' He sat in his arm-chair,
waiting with an uncanny quietness for the church hour to arrive. When
the bell began to ring he arose and passed out of his house, closing
the door behind him. He looked at the river and saw the tide had just
turned. In the church he sat with Sarah and her mother, holding
Sarah's hand tightly in his all the time, as though he feared to lose
her. When the service was over they stood up together, and were
married in the presence of the entire congregation; for no one left
the church. Both made the responses clearly--Eric's being even on the
defiant side. When the wedding was over Sarah took her husband's arm,
and they walked away together, the boys and younger girls being cuffed
by their elders into a decorous behaviour, for they would fain have
followed close behind their heels.

The way from the church led down to the back of Eric's cottage, a
narrow passage being between it and that of his next neighbour. When
the bridal couple had passed through this the remainder of the
congregation, who had followed them at a little distance, were
startled by a long, shrill scream from the bride. They rushed through
the passage and found her on the bank with wild eyes, pointing to the
river bed opposite Eric Sanson's door.

The falling tide had deposited there the body of Abel Behenna stark
upon the broken rocks. The rope trailing from its waist had been
twisted by the current round the mooring post, and had held it back
whilst the tide had ebbed away from it. The right elbow had fallen in
a chink in the rock, leaving the hand outstretched toward Sarah, with
the open palm upward as though it were extended to receive hers, the
pale drooping fingers open to the clasp.

All that happened afterwards was never quite known to Sarah Sanson.
Whenever she would try to recollect there would become a buzzing in
her ears and a dimness in her eyes, and all would pass away. The only
thing that she could remember of it all--and this she never
forgot--was Eric's breathing heavily, with his face whiter than that
of the dead man, as he muttered under his breath:

'Devil's help! Devil's faith! Devil's price!'




The Burial of the Rats


Leaving Paris by the Orleans road, cross the Enceinte, and, turning to
the right, you find yourself in a somewhat wild and not at all savoury
district. Right and left, before and behind, on every side rise great
heaps of dust and waste accumulated by the process of time.

Paris has its night as well as its day life, and the sojourner who
enters his hotel in the Rue de Rivoli or the Rue St. Honore late at
night or leaves it early in the morning, can guess, in coming near
Montrouge--if he has not done so already--the purpose of those great
waggons that look like boilers on wheels which he finds halting
everywhere as he passes.

Every city has its peculiar institutions created out of its own needs;
and one of the most notable institutions of Paris is its rag-picking
population. In the early morning--and Parisian life commences at an
early hour--may be seen in most streets standing on the pathway
opposite every court and alley and between every few houses, as still
in some American cities, even in parts of New York, large wooden boxes
into which the domestics or tenement-holders empty the accumulated
dust of the past day. Round these boxes gather and pass on, when the
work is done, to fresh fields of labour and pastures new, squalid
hungry-looking men and women, the implements of whose craft consist
of a coarse bag or basket slung over the shoulder and a little rake
with which they turn over and probe and examine in the minutest manner
the dustbins. They pick up and deposit in their baskets, by aid of
their rakes, whatever they may find, with the same facility as a
Chinaman uses his chopsticks.

Paris is a city of centralisation--and centralisation and
classification are closely allied. In the early times, when
centralisation is becoming a fact, its forerunner is classification.
All things which are similar or analogous become grouped together, and
from the grouping of groups rises one whole or central point. We see
radiating many long arms with innumerable tentaculae, and in the
centre rises a gigantic head with a comprehensive brain and keen eyes
to look on every side and ears sensitive to hear--and a voracious
mouth to swallow.

Other cities resemble all the birds and beasts and fishes whose
appetites and digestions are normal. Paris alone is the analogical
apotheosis of the octopus. Product of centralisation carried to an _ad
absurdum_, it fairly represents the devil fish; and in no respects is
the resemblance more curious than in the similarity of the digestive
apparatus.

Those intelligent tourists who, having surrendered their individuality
into the hands of Messrs. Cook or Gaze, 'do' Paris in three days, are
often puzzled to know how it is that the dinner which in London would
cost about six shillings, can be had for three francs in a caf in the
Palais Royal. They need have no more wonder if they will but consider
the classification which is a theoretic speciality of Parisian life,
and adopt all round the fact from which the chiffonier has his
genesis.

The Paris of 1850 was not like the Paris of to-day, and those who see
the Paris of Napoleon and Baron Hausseman can hardly realise the
existence of the state of things forty-five years ago.

Amongst other things, however, which have not changed are those
districts where the waste is gathered. Dust is dust all the world
over, in every age, and the family likeness of dust-heaps is perfect.
The traveller, therefore, who visits the environs of Montrouge can go
go back in fancy without difficulty to the year 1850.

In this year I was making a prolonged stay in Paris. I was very much
in love with a young lady who, though she returned my passion, so far
yielded to the wishes of her parents that she had promised not to see
me or to correspond with me for a year. I, too, had been compelled to
accede to these conditions under a vague hope of parental approval.
During the term of probation I had promised to remain out of the
country and not to write to my dear one until the expiration of the
year.

Naturally the time went heavily with me. There was not one of my own
family or circle who could tell me of Alice, and none of her own folk
had, I am sorry to say, sufficient generosity to send me even an
occasional word of comfort regarding her health and well-being. I
spent six months wandering about Europe, but as I could find no
satisfactory distraction in travel, I determined to come to Paris,
where, at least, I would be within easy hail of London in case any
good fortune should call me thither before the appointed time. That
'hope deferred maketh the heart sick' was never better exemplified
than in my case, for in addition to the perpetual longing to see the
face I loved there was always with me a harrowing anxiety lest some
accident should prevent me showing Alice in due time that I had,
throughout the long period of probation, been faithful to her trust
and my own love. Thus, every adventure which I undertook had a fierce
pleasure of its own, for it was fraught with possible consequences
greater than it would have ordinarily borne.

Like all travellers I exhausted the places of most interest in the
first month of my stay, and was driven in the second month to look for
amusement whithersoever I might. Having made sundry journeys to the
better-known suburbs, I began to see that there was a _terra
incognita_, in so far as the guide book was concerned, in the social
wilderness lying between these attractive points. Accordingly I began
to systematise my researches, and each day took up the thread of my
exploration at the place where I had on the previous day dropped it.

In the process of time my wanderings led me near Montrouge, and I saw
that hereabouts lay the Ultima Thule of social exploration--a country
as little known as that round the source of the White Nile. And so I
determined to investigate philosophically the chiffonier--his habitat,
his life, and his means of life.

The job was an unsavoury one, difficult of accomplishment, and with
little hope of adequate reward. However, despite reason, obstinacy
prevailed, and I entered into my new investigation with a keener
energy than I could have summoned to aid me in any investigation
leading to any end, valuable or worthy.

One day, late in a fine afternoon, toward the end of September, I
entered the holy of holies of the city of dust. The place was
evidently the recognised abode of a number of chiffoniers, for some
sort of arrangement was manifested in the formation of the dust heaps
near the road. I passed amongst these heaps, which stood like orderly
sentries, determined to penetrate further and trace dust to its
ultimate location.

As I passed along I saw behind the dust heaps a few forms that flitted
to and fro, evidently watching with interest the advent of any
stranger to such a place. The district was like a small Switzerland,
and as I went forward my tortuous course shut out the path behind me.

Presently I got into what seemed a small city or community of
chiffoniers. There were a number of shanties or huts, such as may be
met with in the remote parts of the Bog of Allan--rude places with
wattled walls, plastered with mud and roofs of rude thatch made from
stable refuse--such places as one would not like to enter for any
consideration, and which even in water-colour could only look
picturesque if judiciously treated. In the midst of these huts was one
of the strangest adaptations--I cannot say habitations--I had ever
seen. An immense old wardrobe, the colossal remnant of some boudoir of
Charles VII, or Henry II, had been converted into a dwelling-house.
The double doors lay open, so that the entire mnage was open to
public view. In the open half of the wardrobe was a common
sitting-room of some four feet by six, in which sat, smoking their
pipes round a charcoal brazier, no fewer than six old soldiers of the
First Republic, with their uniforms torn and worn threadbare.
Evidently they were of the _mauvais sujet_ class; their bleary eyes
and limp jaws told plainly of a common love of absinthe; and their
eyes had that haggard, worn look of slumbering ferocity which follows
hard in the wake of drink. The other side stood as of old, with its
shelves intact, save that they were cut to half their depth, and in
each shelf of which there were six, was a bed made with rags and
straw. The half-dozen of worthies who inhabited this structure looked
at me curiously as I passed; and when I looked back after going a
little way I saw their heads together in a whispered conference. I did
not like the look of this at all, for the place was very lonely, and
the men looked very, very villainous. However, I did not see any cause
for fear, and went on my way, penetrating further and further into the
Sahara. The way was tortuous to a degree, and from going round in a
series of semi-circles, as one goes in skating with the Dutch roll, I
got rather confused with regard to the points of the compass.

When I had penetrated a little way I saw, as I turned the corner of a
half-made heap, sitting on a heap of straw an old soldier with
threadbare coat.

'Hallo!' said I to myself; 'the First Republic is well represented
here in its soldiery.'

As I passed him the old man never even looked up at me, but gazed on
the ground with stolid persistency. Again I remarked to myself: 'See
what a life of rude warfare can do! This old man's curiosity is a
thing of the past.'

When I had gone a few steps, however, I looked back suddenly, and saw
that curiosity was not dead, for the veteran had raised his head and
was regarding me with a very queer expression. He seemed to me to look
very like one of the six worthies in the press. When he saw me looking
he dropped his head; and without thinking further of him I went on my
way, satisfied that there was a strange likeness between these old
warriors.

Presently I met another old soldier in a similar manner. He, too, did
not notice me whilst I was passing.

By this time it was getting late in the afternoon, and I began to
think of retracing my steps. Accordingly I turned to go back, but
could see a number of tracks leading between different mounds and
could not ascertain which of them I should take. In my perplexity I
wanted to see someone of whom to ask the way, but could see no one. I
determined to go on a few mounds further and so try to see
someone--not a veteran.

I gained my object, for after going a couple of hundred yards I saw
before me a single shanty such as I had seen before--with, however,
the difference that this was not one for living in, but merely a roof
with three walls open in front. From the evidences which the
neighbourhood exhibited I took it to be a place for sorting. Within it
was an old woman wrinkled and bent with age; I approached her to ask
the way.

She rose as I came close and I asked her my way. She immediately
commenced a conversation; and it occurred to me that here in the very
centre of the Kingdom of Dust was the place to gather details of the
history of Parisian rag-picking--particularly as I could do so from
the lips of one who looked like the oldest inhabitant.

I began my inquiries, and the old woman gave me most interesting
answers--she had been one of the ceteuces who sat daily before the
guillotine and had taken an active part among the women who signalised
themselves by their violence in the revolution. While we were talking
she said suddenly: 'But m'sieur must be tired standing,' and dusted a
rickety old stool for me to sit down. I hardly liked to do so for many
reasons; but the poor old woman was so civil that I did not like to
run the risk of hurting her by refusing, and moreover the conversation
of one who had been at the taking of the Bastille was so interesting
that I sat down and so our conversation went on.

While we were talking an old man--older and more bent and wrinkled
even than the woman--appeared from behind the shanty. 'Here is
Pierre,' said she. 'M'sieur can hear stories now if he wishes, for
Pierre was in everything, from the Bastille to Waterloo.' The old man
took another stool at my request and we plunged into a sea of
revolutionary reminiscences. This old man, albeit clothed like a
scarecrow, was like any one of the six veterans.

I was now sitting in the centre of the low hut with the woman on my
left hand and the man on my right, each of them being somewhat in
front of me. The place was full of all sorts of curious objects of
lumber, and of many things that I wished far away. In one corner was a
heap of rags which seemed to move from the number of vermin it
contained, and in the other a heap of bones whose odour was something
shocking. Every now and then, glancing at the heaps, I could see the
gleaming eyes of some of the rats which infested the place. These
loathsome objects were bad enough, but what looked even more dreadful
was an old butcher's axe with an iron handle stained with clots of
blood leaning up against the wall on the right hand side. Still, these
things did not give me much concern. The talk of the two old people
was so fascinating that I stayed on and on, till the evening came and
the dust heaps threw dark shadows over the vales between them.

After a time I began to grow uneasy. I could not tell how or why, but
somehow I did not feel satisfied. Uneasiness is an instinct and means
warning. The psychic faculties are often the sentries of the
intellect, and when they sound alarm the reason begins to act,
although perhaps not consciously.

This was so with me. I began to bethink me where I was and by what
surrounded, and to wonder how I should fare in case I should be
attacked; and then the thought suddenly burst upon me, although
without any overt cause, that I was in danger. Prudence whispered: 'Be
still and make no sign,' and so I was still and made no sign, for I
knew that four cunning eyes were on me. 'Four eyes--if not more.' My
God, what a horrible thought! The whole shanty might be surrounded on
three sides with villains! I might be in the midst of a band of such
desperadoes as only half a century of periodic revolution can produce.

With a sense of danger my intellect and observation quickened, and I
grew more watchful than was my wont. I noticed that the old woman's
eyes were constantly wandering towards my hands. I looked at them too,
and saw the cause--my rings. On my left little finger I had a large
signet and on the right a good diamond.

I thought that if there was any danger my first care was to avert
suspicion. Accordingly I began to work the conversation round to
rag-picking--to the drains--of the things found there; and so by easy
stages to jewels. Then, seizing a favourable opportunity, I asked the
old woman if she knew anything of such things. She answered that she
did, a little. I held out my right hand, and, showing her the diamond,
asked her what she thought of that. She answered that her eyes were
bad, and stooped over my hand. I said as nonchalantly as I could:
'Pardon me! You will see better thus!' and taking it off handed it to
her. An unholy light came into her withered old face, as she touched
it. She stole one glance at me swift and keen as a flash of lightning.

She bent over the ring for a moment, her face quite concealed as
though examining it. The old man looked straight out of the front of
the shanty before him, at the same time fumbling in his pockets and
producing a screw of tobacco in a paper and a pipe, which he proceeded
to fill. I took advantage of the pause and the momentary rest from the
searching eyes on my face to look carefully round the place, now dim
and shadowy in the gloaming. There still lay all the heaps of varied
reeking foulness; there the terrible blood-stained axe leaning against
the wall in the right hand corner, and everywhere, despite the gloom,
the baleful glitter of the eyes of the rats. I could see them even
through some of the chinks of the boards at the back low down close to
the ground. But stay! these latter eyes seemed more than usually large
and bright and baleful!

For an instant my heart stood still, and I felt in that whirling
condition of mind in which one feels a sort of spiritual drunkenness,
and as though the body is only maintained erect in that there is no
time for it to fall before recovery. Then, in another second, I was
calm--coldly calm, with all my energies in full vigour, with a
self-control which I felt to be perfect and with all my feeling and
instincts alert.

Now I knew the full extent of my danger: I was watched and surrounded
by desperate people! I could not even guess at how many of them were
lying there on the ground behind the shanty, waiting for the moment to
strike. I knew that I was big and strong, and they knew it, too. They
knew also, as I did, that I was an Englishman and would make a fight
for it; and so we waited. I had, I felt, gained an advantage in the
last few seconds, for I knew my danger and understood the situation.
Now, I thought, is the test of my courage--the enduring test: the
fighting test may come later!

The old woman raised her head and said to me in a satisfied kind of
way:

'A very fine ring, indeed--a beautiful ring! Oh, me! I once had such
rings, plenty of them, and bracelets and earrings! Oh! for in those
fine days I led the town a dance! But they've forgotten me now!
They've forgotten me! They? Why they never heard of me! Perhaps their
grandfathers remember me, some of them!' and she laughed a harsh,
croaking laugh. And then I am bound to say that she astonished me, for
she handed me back the ring with a certain suggestion of old-fashioned
grace which was not without its pathos.

The old man eyed her with a sort of sudden ferocity, half rising from
his stool, and said to me suddenly and hoarsely:

'Let me see!'

I was about to hand the ring when the old woman said:

'No! no, do not give it to Pierre! Pierre is eccentric. He loses
things; and such a pretty ring!'

'Cat!' said the old man, savagely. Suddenly the old woman said, rather
more loudly than was necessary:

'Wait! I shall tell you something about a ring.' There was something
in the sound of her voice that jarred upon me. Perhaps it was my
hyper-sensitiveness, wrought up as I was to such a pitch of nervous
excitement, but I seemed to think that she was not addressing me. As I
stole a glance round the place I saw the eyes of the rats in the bone
heaps, but missed the eyes along the back. But even as I looked I saw
them again appear. The old woman's 'Wait!' had given me a respite from
attack, and the men had sunk back to their reclining posture.

'I once lost a ring--a beautiful diamond hoop that had belonged to a
queen, and which was given to me by a farmer of the taxes, who
afterwards cut his throat because I sent him away. I thought it must
have been stolen, and taxed my people; but I could get no trace. The
police came and suggested that it had found its way to the drain. We
descended--I in my fine clothes, for I would not trust them with my
beautiful ring! I know more of the drains since then, and of rats,
too! but I shall never forget the horror of that place--alive with
blazing eyes, a wall of them just outside the light of our torches.
Well, we got beneath my house. We searched the outlet of the drain,
and there in the filth found my ring, and we came out.

'But we found something else also before we came! As we were coming
toward the opening a lot of sewer rats--human ones this time--came
towards us. They told the police that one of their number had gone
into the drain, but had not returned. He had gone in only shortly
before we had, and, if lost, could hardly be far off. They asked help
to seek him, so we turned back. They tried to prevent me going, but I
insisted. It was a new excitement, and had I not recovered my ring?
Not far did we go till we came on something. There was but little
water, and the bottom of the drain was raised with brick, rubbish, and
much matter of the kind. He had made a fight for it, even when his
torch had gone out. But they were too many for him! They had not been
long about it! The bones were still warm; but they were picked clean.
They had even eaten their own dead ones and there were bones of rats
as well as of the man. They took it cool enough those other--the human
ones--and joked of their comrade when they found him dead, though they
would have helped him living. Bah! what matters it--life or death?'

'And had you no fear?' I asked her.

'Fear!' she said with a laugh. 'Me have fear? Ask Pierre! But I was
younger then, and, as I came through that horrible drain with its wall
of greedy eyes, always moving with the circle of the light from the
torches, I did not feel easy. I kept on before the men, though! It is
a way I have! I never let the men get it before me. All I want is a
chance and a means! And they ate him up--took every trace away except
the bones; and no one knew it, nor no sound of him was ever heard!'
Here she broke into a chuckling fit of the ghastliest merriment which
it was ever my lot to hear and see. A great poetess describes her
heroine singing: 'Oh! to see or hear her singing! Scarce I know which
is the divinest.'

And I can apply the same idea to the old crone--in all save the
divinity, for I scarce could tell which was the most hellish--the
harsh, malicious, satisfied, cruel laugh, or the leering grin, and the
horrible square opening of the mouth like a tragic mask, and the
yellow gleam of the few discoloured teeth in the shapeless gums. In
that laugh and with that grin and the chuckling satisfaction I knew as
well as if it had been spoken to me in words of thunder that my murder
was settled, and the murderers only bided the proper time for its
accomplishment. I could read between the lines of her gruesome story
the commands to her accomplices. 'Wait,' she seemed to say, 'bide your
time. I shall strike the first blow. Find the weapon for me, and I
shall make the opportunity! He shall not escape! Keep him quiet, and
then no one will be wiser. There will be no outcry, and the rats will
do their work!'

It was growing darker and darker; the night was coming. I stole a
glance round the shanty, still all the same! The bloody axe in the
corner, the heaps of filth, and the eyes on the bone heaps and in the
crannies of the floor.

Pierre had been still ostensibly filling his pipe; he now struck a
light and began to puff away at it. The old woman said:

'Dear heart, how dark it is! Pierre, like a good lad, light the lamp!'

Pierre got up and with the lighted match in his hand touched the wick
of a lamp which hung at one side of the entrance to the shanty, and
which had a reflector that threw the light all over the place. It was
evidently that which was used for their sorting at night.

'Not that, stupid! Not that! the lantern!' she called out to him.

He immediately blew it out, saying: 'All right, mother I'll find it,'
and he hustled about the left corner of the room--the old woman saying
through the darkness:

'The lantern! the lantern! Oh! That is the light that is most useful to
us poor folks. The lantern was the friend of the revolution! It is the
friend of the chiffonier! It helps us when all else fails.'

Hardly had she said the word when there was a kind of creaking of the
whole place, and something was steadily dragged over the roof.

Again I seemed to read between the lines of her words. I knew the
lesson of the lantern.

'One of you get on the roof with a noose and strangle him as he passes
out if we fail within.'

As I looked out of the opening I saw the loop of a rope outlined black
against the lurid sky. I was now, indeed, beset!

Pierre was not long in finding the lantern. I kept my eyes fixed
through the darkness on the old woman. Pierre struck his light, and by
its flash I saw the old woman raise from the ground beside her where
it had mysteriously appeared, and then hide in the folds of her gown,
a long sharp knife or dagger. It seemed to be like a butcher's
sharpening iron fined to a keen point.

The lantern was lit.

'Bring it here, Pierre,' she said. 'Place it in the doorway where we
can see it. See how nice it is! It shuts out the darkness from us; it
is just right!'

Just right for her and her purposes! It threw all its light on my
face, leaving in gloom the faces of both Pierre and the woman, who sat
outside of me on each side.

I felt that the time of action was approaching, but I knew now that
the first signal and movement would come from the woman, and so
watched her.

I was all unarmed, but I had made up my mind what to do. At the first
movement I would seize the butcher's axe in the right-hand corner and
fight my way out. At least, I would die hard. I stole a glance round
to fix its exact locality so that I could not fail to seize it at the
first effort, for then, if ever, time and accuracy would be precious.

Good God! It was gone! All the horror of the situation burst upon me;
but the bitterest thought of all was that if the issue of the terrible
position should be against me Alice would infallibly suffer. Either
she would believe me false--and any lover, or any one who has ever
been one, can imagine the bitterness of the thought--or else she would
go on loving long after I had been lost to her and to the world, so
that her life would be broken and embittered, shattered with
disappointment and despair. The very magnitude of the pain braced me
up and nerved me to bear the dread scrutiny of the plotters.

I think I did not betray myself. The old woman was watching me as a
cat does a mouse; she had her right hand hidden in the folds of her
gown, clutching, I knew, that long, cruel-looking dagger. Had she seen
any disappointment in my face she would, I felt, have known that the
moment had come, and would have sprung on me like a tigress, certain
of taking me unprepared.

I looked out into the night, and there I saw new cause for danger.
Before and around the hut were at a little distance some shadowy
forms; they were quite still, but I knew that they were all alert and
on guard. Small chance for me now in that direction.

Again I stole a glance round the place. In moments of great excitement
and of great danger, which is excitement, the mind works very quickly,
and the keenness of the faculties which depend on the mind grows in
proportion. I now felt this. In an instant I took in the whole
situation. I saw that the axe had been taken through a small hole made
in one of the rotten boards. How rotten they must be to allow of such
a thing being done without a particle of noise.

The hut was a regular murder-trap, and was guarded all around. A
garroter lay on the roof ready to entangle me with his noose if I
should escape the dagger of the old hag. In front the way was guarded
by I know not how many watchers. And at the back was a row of
desperate men--I had seen their eyes still through the crack in the
boards of the floor, when last I looked--as they lay prone waiting for
the signal to start erect. If it was to be ever, now for it!

As nonchalantly as I could I turned slightly on my stool so as to get
my right leg well under me. Then with a sudden jump, turning my head,
and guarding it with my hands, and with the fighting instinct of the
knights of old, I breathed my lady's name, and hurled myself against
the back wall of the hut.

Watchful as they were, the suddenness of my movement surprised both
Pierre and the old woman. As I crashed through the rotten timbers I
saw the old woman rise with a leap like a tiger and heard her low gasp
of baffled rage. My feet lit on something that moved, and as I jumped
away I knew that I had stepped on the back of one of the row of men
lying on their faces outside the hut. I was torn with nails and
splinters, but otherwise unhurt. Breathless I rushed up the mound in
front of me, hearing as I went the dull crash of the shanty as it
collapsed into a mass.

It was a nightmare climb. The mound, though but low, was awfully
steep, and with each step I took the mass of dust and cinders tore
down with me and gave way under my feet. The dust rose and choked me;
it was sickening, foetid, awful; but my climb was, I felt, for life or
death, and I struggled on. The seconds seemed hours; but the few
moments I had in starting, combined with my youth and strength, gave
me a great advantage, and, though several forms struggled after me in
deadly silence which was more dreadful than any sound, I easily
reached the top. Since then I have climbed the cone of Vesuvius, and
as I struggled up that dreary steep amid the sulphurous fumes the
memory of that awful night at Montrouge came back to me so vividly
that I almost grew faint.

The mound was one of the tallest in the region of dust, and as I
struggled to the top, panting for breath and with my heart beating
like a sledge-hammer, I saw away to my left the dull red gleam of the
sky, and nearer still the flashing of lights. Thank God! I knew where
I was now and where lay the road to Paris!

For two or three seconds I paused and looked back. My pursuers were
still well behind me, but struggling up resolutely, and in deadly
silence. Beyond, the shanty was a wreck--a mass of timber and moving
forms. I could see it well, for flames were already bursting out; the
rags and straw had evidently caught fire from the lantern. Still
silence there! Not a sound! These old wretches could die game, anyhow.

I had no time for more than a passing glance, for as I cast an eye
round the mound preparatory to making my descent I saw several dark
forms rushing round on either side to cut me off on my way. It was now
a race for life. They were trying to head me on my way to Paris, and
with the instinct of the moment I dashed down to the right-hand side.
I was just in time, for, though I came as it seemed to me down the
steep in a few steps, the wary old men who were watching me turned
back, and one, as I rushed by into the opening between the two mounds
in front, almost struck me a blow with that terrible butcher's axe.
There could surely not be two such weapons about!

Then began a really horrible chase. I easily ran ahead of the old men,
and even when some younger ones and a few women joined in the hunt I
easily distanced them. But I did not know the way, and I could not
even guide myself by the light in the sky, for I was running away from
it. I had heard that, unless of conscious purpose, hunted men turn
always to the left, and so I found it now; and so, I suppose, knew
also my pursuers, who were more animals than men, and with cunning or
instinct had found out such secrets for themselves: for on finishing
a quick spurt, after which I intended to take a moment's breathing
space, I suddenly saw ahead of me two or three forms swiftly passing
behind a mound to the right.

I was in the spider's web now indeed! But with the thought of this new
danger came the resource of the hunted, and so I darted down the next
turning to the right. I continued in this direction for some hundred
yards, and then, making a turn to the left again, felt certain that I
had, at any rate, avoided the danger of being surrounded.

But not of pursuit, for on came the rabble after me, steady, dogged,
relentless, and still in grim silence.

In the greater darkness the mounds seemed now to be somewhat smaller
than before, although--for the night was closing--they looked bigger
in proportion. I was now well ahead of my pursuers, so I made a dart
up the mound in front.

Oh joy of joys! I was close to the edge of this inferno of dustheaps.
Away behind me the red light of Paris was in the sky, and towering up
behind rose the heights of Montmarte--a dim light, with here and there
brilliant points like stars.

Restored to vigour in a moment, I ran over the few remaining mounds of
decreasing size, and found myself on the level land beyond. Even then,
however, the prospect was not inviting. All before me was dark and
dismal, and I had evidently come on one of those dank, low-lying waste
places which are found here and there in the neighbourhood of great
cities. Places of waste and desolation, where the space is required
for the ultimate agglomeration of all that is noxious, and the ground
is so poor as to create no desire of occupancy even in the lowest
squatter. With eyes accustomed to the gloom of the evening, and away
now from the shadows of those dreadful dustheaps, I could see much
more easily than I could a little while ago. It might have been, of
course, that the glare in the sky of the lights of Paris, though the
city was some miles away, was reflected here. Howsoever it was, I saw
well enough to take bearings for certainly some little distance around
me.

In front was a bleak, flat waste that seemed almost dead level, with
here and there the dark shimmering of stagnant pools. Seemingly far
off on the right, amid a small cluster of scattered lights, rose a
dark mass of Fort Montrouge, and away to the left in the dim distance,
pointed with stray gleams from cottage windows, the lights in the sky
showed the locality of Bictre. A moment's thought decided me to take
to the right and try to reach Montrouge. There at least would be some
sort of safety, and I might possibly long before come on some of the
cross roads which I knew. Somewhere, not far off, must lie the
strategic road made to connect the outlying chain of forts circling
the city.

Then I looked back. Coming over the mounds, and outlined black against
the glare of the Parisian horizon, I saw several moving figures, and
still a way to the right several more deploying out between me and my
destination. They evidently meant to cut me off in this direction, and
so my choice became constricted; it lay now between going straight
ahead or turning to the left. Stooping to the ground, so as to get the
advantage of the horizon as a line of sight, I looked carefully in
this direction, but could detect no sign of my enemies. I argued that
as they had not guarded or were not trying to guard that point, there
was evidently danger to me there already. So I made up my mind to go
straight on before me.

It was not an inviting prospect, and as I went on the reality grew
worse. The ground became soft and oozy, and now and again gave way
beneath me in a sickening kind of way. I seemed somehow to be going
down, for I saw round me places seemingly more elevated than where I
was, and this in a place which from a little way back seemed dead
level. I looked around, but could see none of my pursuers. This was
strange, for all along these birds of the night had followed me
through the darkness as well as though it was broad daylight. How I
blamed myself for coming out in my light-coloured tourist suit of
tweed. The silence, and my not being able to see my enemies, whilst I
felt that they were watching me, grew appalling, and in the hope of
some one not of this ghastly crew hearing me I raised my voice and
shouted several times. There was not the slightest response; not even
an echo rewarded my efforts. For a while I stood stock still and kept
my eyes in one direction. On one of the rising places around me I saw
something dark move along, then another, and another. This was to my
left, and seemingly moving to head me off.

I thought that again I might with my skill as a runner elude my
enemies at this game, and so with all my speed darted forward.

Splash!

My feet had given way in a mass of slimy rubbish, and I had fallen
headlong into a reeking, stagnant pool. The water and the mud in which
my arms sank up to the elbows was filthy and nauseous beyond
description, and in the suddenness of my fall I had actually swallowed
some of the filthy stuff, which nearly choked me, and made me gasp
for breath. Never shall I forget the moments during which I stood
trying to recover myself almost fainting from the foetid odour of the
filthy pool, whose white mist rose ghostlike around. Worst of all,
with the acute despair of the hunted animal when he sees the pursuing
pack closing on him, I saw before my eyes whilst I stood helpless the
dark forms of my pursuers moving swiftly to surround me.

It is curious how our minds work on odd matters even when the energies
of thought are seemingly concentrated on some terrible and pressing
need. I was in momentary peril of my life: my safety depended on my
action, and my choice of alternatives coming now with almost every
step I took, and yet I could not but think of the strange dogged
persistency of these old men. Their silent resolution, their
steadfast, grim, persistency even in such a cause commanded, as well
as fear, even a measure of respect. What must they have been in the
vigour of their youth. I could understand now that whirlwind rush on
the bridge of Arcola, that scornful exclamation of the Old Guard at
Waterloo! Unconscious cerebration has its own pleasures, even at such
moments; but fortunately it does not in any way clash with the thought
from which action springs.

I realised at a glance that so far I was defeated in my object, my
enemies as yet had won. They had succeeded in surrounding me on three
sides, and were bent on driving me off to the left-hand, where there
was already some danger for me, for they had left no guard. I accepted
the alternative--it was a case of Hobson's choice and run. I had to
keep the lower ground, for my pursuers were on the higher places.
However, though the ooze and broken ground impeded me my youth and
training made me able to hold my ground, and by keeping a diagonal
line I not only kept them from gaining on me but even began to
distance them. This gave me new heart and strength, and by this time
habitual training was beginning to tell and my second wind had come.
Before me the ground rose slightly. I rushed up the slope and found
before me a waste of watery slime, with a low dyke or bank looking
black and grim beyond. I felt that if I could but reach that dyke in
safety I could there, with solid ground under my feet and some kind of
path to guide me, find with comparative ease a way out of my troubles.
After a glance right and left and seeing no one near, I kept my eyes
for a few minutes to their rightful work of aiding my feet whilst I
crossed the swamp. It was rough, hard work, but there was little
danger, merely toil; and a short time took me to the dyke. I rushed up
the slope exulting; but here again I met a new shock. On either side
of me rose a number of crouching figures. From right and left they
rushed at me. Each body held a rope.

The cordon was nearly complete. I could pass on neither side, and the
end was near.

There was only one chance, and I took it. I hurled myself across the
dyke, and escaping out of the very clutches of my foes threw myself
into the stream.

At any other time I should have thought that water foul and filthy,
but now it was as welcome as the most crystal stream to the parched
traveller. It was a highway of safety!

My pursuers rushed after me. Had only one of them held the rope it
would have been all up with me, for he could have entangled me before
I had time to swim a stroke; but the many hands holding it embarrassed
and delayed them, and when the rope struck the water I heard the
splash well behind me. A few minutes' hard swimming took me across
the stream. Refreshed with the immersion and encouraged by the escape,
I climbed the dyke in comparative gaiety of spirits.

From the top I looked back. Through the darkness I saw my assailants
scattering up and down along the dyke. The pursuit was evidently not
ended, and again I had to choose my course. Beyond the dyke where I
stood was a wild, swampy space very similar to that which I had
crossed. I determined to shun such a place, and thought for a moment
whether I would take up or down the dyke. I thought I heard a
sound--the muffled sound of oars, so I listened, and then shouted.

No response; but the sound ceased. My enemies had evidently got a boat
of some kind. As they were on the up side of me I took the down path
and began to run. As I passed to the left of where I had entered the
water I heard several splashes, soft and stealthy, like the sound a
rat makes as he plunges into the stream, but vastly greater; and as I
looked I saw the dark sheen of the water broken by the ripples of
several advancing heads. Some of my enemies were swimming the stream
also.

And now behind me, up the stream, the silence was broken by the quick
rattle and creak of oars; my enemies were in hot pursuit. I put my
best leg foremost and ran on. After a break of a couple of minutes I
looked back, and by a gleam of light through the ragged clouds I saw
several dark forms climbing the bank behind me. The wind had now begun
to rise, and the water beside me was ruffled and beginning to break in
tiny waves on the bank. I had to keep my eyes pretty well on the
ground before me, lest I should stumble, for I knew that to stumble
was death. After a few minutes I looked back behind me. On the dyke
were only a few dark figures, but crossing the waste, swampy ground
were many more. What new danger this portended I did not know--could
only guess. Then as I ran it seemed to me that my track kept ever
sloping away to the right. I looked up ahead and saw that the river
was much wider than before, and that the dyke on which I stood fell
quite away, and beyond it was another stream on whose near bank I saw
some of the dark forms now across the marsh. I was on an island of
some kind.

My situation was now indeed terrible, for my enemies had hemmed me in
on every side. Behind came the quickening roll of the oars, as though
my pursuers knew that the end was close. Around me on every side was
desolation; there was not a roof or light, as far as I could see. Far
off to the right rose some dark mass, but what it was I knew not. For
a moment I paused to think what I should do, not for more, for my
pursuers were drawing closer. Then my mind was made up. I slipped down
the bank and took to the water. I struck out straight ahead so as to
gain the current by clearing the backwater of the island, for such I
presume it was, when I had passed into the stream. I waited till a
cloud came driving across the moon and leaving all in darkness. Then I
took off my hat and laid it softly on the water floating with the
stream, and a second after dived to the right and struck out under
water with all my might. I was, I suppose, half a minute under water,
and when I rose came up as softly as I could, and turning, looked
back. There went my light brown hat floating merrily away. Close
behind it came a rickety old boat, driven furiously by a pair of oars.
The moon was still partly obscured by the drifting clouds, but in the
partial light I could see a man in the bows holding aloft ready to
strike what appeared to me to be that same dreadful pole-axe which I
had before escaped. As I looked the boat drew closer, closer, and the
man struck savagely. The hat disappeared. The man fell forward, almost
out of the boat. His comrades dragged him in but without the axe, and
then as I turned with all my energies bent on reaching the further
bank, I heard the fierce whirr of the muttered 'Sacre!' which marked
the anger of my baffled pursuers.

That was the first sound I had heard from human lips during all this
dreadful chase, and full as it was of menace and danger to me it was a
welcome sound for it broke that awful silence which shrouded and
appalled me. It was as though an overt sign that my opponents were men
and not ghosts, and that with them I had, at least, the chance of a
man, though but one against many.

But now that the spell of silence was broken the sounds came thick and
fast. From boat to shore and back from shore to boat came quick
question and answer, all in the fiercest whispers. I looked back--a
fatal thing to do--for in the instant someone caught sight of my face,
which showed white on the dark water, and shouted. Hands pointed to
me, and in a moment or two the boat was under weigh, and following
hard after me. I had but a little way to go, but quicker and quicker
came the boat after me. A few more strokes and I would be on the
shore, but I felt the oncoming of the boat, and expected each second
to feel the crash of an oar or other weapon on my head. Had I not seen
that dreadful axe disappear in the water I do not think that I could
have won the shore. I heard the muttered curses of those not rowing
and the laboured breath of the rowers. With one supreme effort for
life or liberty I touched the bank and sprang up it. There was not a
single second to spare, for hard behind me the boat grounded and
several dark forms sprang after me. I gained the top of the dyke, and
keeping to the left ran on again. The boat put off and followed down
the stream. Seeing this I feared danger in this direction, and quickly
turning, ran down the dyke on the other side, and after passing a
short stretch of marshy ground gained a wild, open flat country and
sped on.

Still behind me came on my relentless pursuers. Far away, below me, I
saw the same dark mass as before, but now grown closer and greater. My
heart gave a great thrill of delight, for I knew that it must be the
fortress of Bictre, and with new courage I ran on. I had heard that
between each and all of the protecting forts of Paris there are
strategic ways, deep sunk roads where soldiers marching should be
sheltered from an enemy. I knew that if I could gain this road I would
be safe, but in the darkness I could not see any sign of it, so, in
blind hope of striking it, I ran on.

Presently I came to the edge of a deep cut, and found that down below
me ran a road guarded on each side by a ditch of water fenced on
either side by a straight, high wall.

Getting fainter and dizzier, I ran on; the ground got more
broken--more and more still, till I staggered and fell, and rose
again, and ran on in the blind anguish of the hunted. Again the
thought of Alice nerved me. I would not be lost and wreck her life: I
would fight and struggle for life to the bitter end. With a great
effort I caught the top of the wall. As, scrambling like a catamount,
I drew myself up, I actually felt a hand touch the sole of my foot. I
was now on a sort of causeway, and before me I saw a dim light. Blind
and dizzy, I ran on, staggered, and fell, rising, covered with dust
and blood.

'Halt la!'

The words sounded like a voice from heaven. A blaze of light seemed to
enwrap me, and I shouted with joy.

'Qui va la?' The rattle of musketry, the flash of steel before my
eyes. Instinctively I stopped, though close behind me came a rush of
my pursuers.

Another word or two, and out from a gateway poured, as it seemed to
me, a tide of red and blue, as the guard turned out. All around seemed
blazing with light, and the flash of steel, the clink and rattle of
arms, and the loud, harsh voices of command. As I fell forward,
utterly exhausted, a soldier caught me. I looked back in dreadful
expectation, and saw the mass of dark forms disappearing into the
night. Then I must have fainted. When I recovered my senses I was in
the guard room. They gave me brandy, and after a while I was able to
tell them something of what had passed. Then a commissary of police
appeared, apparently out of the empty air, as is the way of the
Parisian police officer. He listened attentively, and then had a
moment's consultation with the officer in command. Apparently they
were agreed, for they asked me if I were ready now to come with them.

'Where to?' I asked, rising to go.

'Back to the dust heaps. We shall, perhaps, catch them yet!'

'I shall try!' said I.

He eyed me for a moment keenly, and said suddenly:

'Would you like to wait a while or till tomorrow, young Englishman?'
This touched me to the quick, as, perhaps, he intended, and I jumped
to my feet.

'Come now!' I said; 'now! now! An Englishman is always ready for his
duty!'

The commissary was a good fellow, as well as a shrewd one; he slapped
my shoulder kindly. 'Brave garon!' he said. 'Forgive me, but I knew
what would do you most good. The guard is ready. Come!'

And so, passing right through the guard room, and through a long
vaulted passage, we were out into the night. A few of the men in front
had powerful lanterns. Through courtyards and down a sloping way we
passed out through a low archway to a sunken road, the same that I had
seen in my flight. The order was given to get at the double, and with
a quick, springing stride, half run, half walk, the soldiers went
swiftly along. I felt my strength renewed again--such is the
difference between hunter and hunted. A very short distance took us to
a low-lying pontoon bridge across the stream, and evidently very
little higher up than I had struck it. Some effort had evidently been
made to damage it, for the ropes had all been cut, and one of the
chains had been broken. I heard the officer say to the commissary:

'We are just in time! A few more minutes, and they would have
destroyed the bridge. Forward, quicker still!' and on we went. Again
we reached a pontoon on the winding stream; as we came up we heard the
hollow boom of the metal drums as the efforts to destroy the bridge
was again renewed. A word of command was given, and several men raised
their rifles.

'Fire!' A volley rang out. There was a muffled cry, and the dark forms
dispersed. But the evil was done, and we saw the far end of the
pontoon swing into the stream. This was a serious delay, and it was
nearly an hour before we had renewed ropes and restored the bridge
sufficiently to allow us to cross.

We renewed the chase. Quicker, quicker we went towards the dust
heaps.

After a time we came to a place that I knew. There were the remains of
a fire--a few smouldering wood ashes still cast a red glow, but the
bulk of the ashes were cold. I knew the site of the hut and the hill
behind it up which I had rushed, and in the flickering glow the eyes
of the rats still shone with a sort of phosphorescence. The commissary
spoke a word to the officer, and he cried:

'Halt!'

The soldiers were ordered to spread around and watch, and then we
commenced to examine the ruins. The commissary himself began to lift
away the charred boards and rubbish. These the soldiers took and piled
together. Presently he started back, then bent down and rising
beckoned me.

'See!' he said.

It was a gruesome sight. There lay a skeleton face downwards, a woman
by the lines--an old woman by the coarse fibre of the bone. Between
the ribs rose a long spike-like dagger made from a butcher's
sharpening knife, its keen point buried in the spine.

'You will observe,' said the commissary to the officer and to me as he
took out his note book, 'that the woman must have fallen on her
dagger. The rats are many here--see their eyes glistening among that
heap of bones--and you will also notice'--I shuddered as he placed his
hand on the skeleton--'that but little time was lost by them, for the
bones are scarcely cold!'

There was no other sign of any one near, living or dead; and so
deploying again into line the soldiers passed on. Presently we came to
the hut made of the old wardrobe. We approached. In five of the six
compartments was an old man sleeping--sleeping so soundly that even
the glare of the lanterns did not wake them. Old and grim and grizzled
they looked, with their gaunt, wrinkled, bronzed faces and their white
moustaches.

The officer called out harshly and loudly a word of command, and in an
instant each one of them was on his feet before us and standing at
'attention!'

'What do you here?'

'We sleep,' was the answer.

'Where are the other chiffoniers?' asked the commissary.

'Gone to work.'

'And you?'

'We are on guard!'

'Peste!' laughed the officer grimly, as he looked at the old men one
after the other in the face and added with cool deliberate cruelty:
'Asleep on duty! Is this the manner of the Old Guard? No wonder, then,
a Waterloo!'

By the gleam of the lantern I saw the grim old faces grow deadly pale,
and almost shuddered at the look in the eyes of the old men as the
laugh of the soldiers echoed the grim pleasantry of the officer.

I felt in that moment that I was in some measure avenged.

For a moment they looked as if they would throw themselves on the
taunter, but years of their life had schooled them and they remained
still.

'You are but five,' said the commissary; 'where is the sixth?' The
answer came with a grim chuckle.

'He is there!' and the speaker pointed to the bottom of the wardrobe.
'He died last night. You won't find much of him. The burial of the
rats is quick!'

The commissary stooped and looked in. Then he turned to the officer
and said calmly:

'We may as well go back. No trace here now; nothing to prove that man
was the one wounded by your soldiers' bullets! Probably they murdered
him to cover up the trace. See!' again he stooped and placed his hands
on the skeleton. 'The rats work quickly and they are many. These bones
are warm!'

I shuddered, and so did many more of those around me.

'Form!' said the officer, and so in marching order, with the lanterns
swinging in front and the manacled veterans in the midst, with steady
tramp we took ourselves out of the dustheaps and turned backward to
the fortress of Bictre.

       *       *       *       *       *

My year of probation has long since ended, and Alice is my wife. But
when I look back upon that trying twelvemonth one of the most vivid
incidents that memory recalls is that associated with my visit to the
City of Dust.




A Dream of Red Hands


The first opinion given to me regarding Jacob Settle was a simple
descriptive statement, 'He's a down-in-the-mouth chap': but I found
that it embodied the thoughts and ideas of all his fellow-workmen.
There was in the phrase a certain easy tolerance, an absence of
positive feeling of any kind, rather than any complete opinion, which
marked pretty accurately the man's place in public esteem. Still,
there was some dissimilarity between this and his appearance which
unconsciously set me thinking, and by degrees, as I saw more of the
place and the workmen, I came to have a special interest in him. He
was, I found, for ever doing kindnesses, not involving money expenses
beyond his humble means, but in the manifold ways of forethought and
forbearance and self-repression which are of the truer charities of
life. Women and children trusted him implicitly, though, strangely
enough, he rather shunned them, except when anyone was sick, and then
he made his appearance to help if he could, timidly and awkwardly. He
led a very solitary life, keeping house by himself in a tiny cottage,
or rather hut, of one room, far on the edge of the moorland. His
existence seemed so sad and solitary that I wished to cheer it up, and
for the purpose took the occasion when we had both been sitting up
with a child, injured by me through accident, to offer to lend him
books. He gladly accepted, and as we parted in the grey of the dawn I
felt that something of mutual confidence had been established between
us.

The books were always most carefully and punctually returned, and in
time Jacob Settle and I became quite friends. Once or twice as I
crossed the moorland on Sundays I looked in on him; but on such
occasions he was shy and ill at ease so that I felt diffident about
calling to see him. He would never under any circumstances come into
my own lodgings.

One Sunday afternoon, I was coming back from a long walk beyond the
moor, and as I passed Settle's cottage stopped at the door to say 'How
do you do?' to him. As the door was shut, I thought that he was out,
and merely knocked for form's sake, or through habit, not expecting to
get any answer. To my surprise, I heard a feeble voice from within,
though what was said I could not hear. I entered at once, and found
Jacob lying half-dressed upon his bed. He was as pale as death, and
the sweat was simply rolling off his face. His hands were
unconsciously gripping the bedclothes as a drowning man holds on to
whatever he may grasp. As I came in he half arose, with a wild, hunted
look in his eyes, which were wide open and staring, as though
something of horror had come before him; but when he recognised me he
sank back on the couch with a smothered sob of relief and closed his
eyes. I stood by him for a while, quite a minute or two, while he
gasped. Then he opened his eyes and looked at me, but with such a
despairing, woeful expression that, as I am a living man, I would have
rather seen that frozen look of horror. I sat down beside him and
asked after his health. For a while he would not answer me except to
say that he was not ill; but then, after scrutinising me closely, he
half arose on his elbow and said:

'I thank you kindly, sir, but I'm simply telling you the truth. I am
not ill, as men call it, though God knows whether there be not worse
sicknesses than doctors know of. I'll tell you, as you are so kind,
but I trust that you won't even mention such a thing to a living soul,
for it might work me more and greater woe. I am suffering from a bad
dream.'

'A bad dream!' I said, hoping to cheer him; 'but dreams pass away with
the light--even with waking.' There I stopped, for before he spoke I
saw the answer in his desolate look round the little place.

'No! no! that's all well for people that live in comfort and with
those they love around them. It is a thousand times worse for those
who live alone and have to do so. What cheer is there for me, waking
here in the silence of the night, with the wide moor around me full of
voices and full of faces that make my waking a worse dream than my
sleep? Ah, young sir, you have no past that can send its legions to
people the darkness and the empty space, and I pray the good God that
you may never have!' As he spoke, there was such an almost
irresistible gravity of conviction in his manner that I abandoned my
remonstrance about his solitary life. I felt that I was in the
presence of some secret influence which I could not fathom. To my
relief, for I knew not what to say, he went on:

'Two nights past have I dreamed it. It was hard enough the first
night, but I came through it. Last night the expectation was in itself
almost worse than the dream--until the dream came, and then it swept
away every remembrance of lesser pain. I stayed awake till just
before the dawn, and then it came again, and ever since I have been in
such an agony as I am sure the dying feel, and with it all the dread
of tonight.' Before he had got to the end of the sentence my mind was
made up, and I felt that I could speak to him more cheerfully.

'Try and get to sleep early tonight--in fact, before the evening has
passed away. The sleep will refresh you, and I promise you there will
not be any bad dreams after tonight.' He shook his head hopelessly, so
I sat a little longer and then left him.

When I got home I made my arrangements for the night, for I had made
up my mind to share Jacob Settle's lonely vigil in his cottage on the
moor. I judged that if he got to sleep before sunset he would wake
well before midnight, and so, just as the bells of the city were
striking eleven, I stood opposite his door armed with a bag, in which
were my supper, an extra large flask, a couple of candles, and a book.
The moonlight was bright, and flooded the whole moor, till it was
almost as light as day; but ever and anon black clouds drove across
the sky, and made a darkness which by comparison seemed almost
tangible. I opened the door softly, and entered without waking Jacob,
who lay asleep with his white face upward. He was still, and again
bathed in sweat. I tried to imagine what visions were passing before
those closed eyes which could bring with them the misery and woe which
were stamped on the face, but fancy failed me, and I waited for the
awakening. It came suddenly, and in a fashion which touched me to the
quick, for the hollow groan that broke from the man's white lips as he
half arose and sank back was manifestly the realisation or completion
of some train of thought which had gone before.

'If this be dreaming,' said I to myself, 'then it must be based on
some very terrible reality. What can have been that unhappy fact that
he spoke of?'

While I thus spoke, he realised that I was with him. It struck me as
strange that he had no period of that doubt as to whether dream or
reality surrounded him which commonly marks an expected environment of
waking men. With a positive cry of joy, he seized my hand and held it
in his two wet, trembling hands, as a frightened child clings on to
someone whom it loves. I tried to soothe him:

'There, there! it is all right. I have come to stay with you tonight,
and together we will try to fight this evil dream.' He let go my hand
suddenly, and sank back on his bed and covered his eyes with his
hands.

'Fight it?--the evil dream! Ah! no, sir, no! No mortal power can fight
that dream, for it comes from God--and is burned in here;' and he beat
upon his forehead. Then he went on:

'It is the same dream, ever the same, and yet it grows in its power to
torture me every time it comes.'

'What is the dream?' I asked, thinking that the speaking of it might
give him some relief, but he shrank away from me, and after a long
pause said:

'No, I had better not tell it. It may not come again.'

There was manifestly something to conceal from me--something that lay
behind the dream, so I answered:

'All right. I hope you have seen the last of it. But if it should come
again, you will tell me, will you not? I ask, not out of curiosity,
but because I think it may relieve you to speak.' He answered with
what I thought was almost an undue amount of solemnity:

'If it comes again, I shall tell you all.'

Then I tried to get his mind away from the subject to more mundane
things, so I produced supper, and made him share it with me, including
the contents of the flask. After a little he braced up, and when I lit
my cigar, having given him another, we smoked a full hour, and talked
of many things. Little by little the comfort of his body stole over
his mind, and I could see sleep laying her gentle hands on his
eyelids. He felt it, too, and told me that now he felt all right, and
I might safely leave him; but I told him that, right or wrong, I was
going to see in the daylight. So I lit my other candle, and began to
read as he fell asleep.

By degrees I got interested in my book, so interested that presently I
was startled by its dropping out of my hands. I looked and saw that
Jacob was still asleep, and I was rejoiced to see that there was on
his face a look of unwonted happiness, while his lips seemed to move
with unspoken words. Then I turned to my work again, and again woke,
but this time to feel chilled to my very marrow by hearing the voice
from the bed beside me:

'Not with those red hands! Never! never!' On looking at him, I found
that he was still asleep. He woke, however, in an instant, and did not
seem surprised to see me; there was again that strange apathy as to
his surroundings. Then I said:

'Settle, tell me your dream. You may speak freely, for I shall hold
your confidence sacred. While we both live I shall never mention what
you may choose to tell me.'

He replied:

'I said I would; but I had better tell you first what goes before the
dream, that you may understand. I was a schoolmaster when I was a very
young man; it was only a parish school in a little village in the
West Country. No need to mention any names. Better not. I was engaged
to be married to a young girl whom I loved and almost reverenced. It
was the old story. While we were waiting for the time when we could
afford to set up house together, another man came along. He was nearly
as young as I was, and handsome, and a gentleman, with all a
gentleman's attractive ways for a woman of our class. He would go
fishing, and she would meet him while I was at my work in school. I
reasoned with her and implored her to give him up. I offered to get
married at once and go away and begin the world in a strange country;
but she would not listen to anything I could say, and I could see that
she was infatuated with him. Then I took it on myself to meet the man
and ask him to deal well with the girl, for I thought he might mean
honestly by her, so that there might be no talk or chance of talk on
the part of others. I went where I should meet him with none by, and
we met!' Here Jacob Settle had to pause, for something seemed to rise
in his throat, and he almost gasped for breath. Then he went on:

'Sir, as God is above us, there was no selfish thought in my heart
that day, I loved my pretty Mabel too well to be content with a part
of her love, and I had thought of my own unhappiness too often not to
have come to realise that, whatever might come to her, my hope was
gone. He was insolent to me--you, sir, who are a gentleman, cannot
know, perhaps, how galling can be the insolence of one who is above
you in station--but I bore with that. I implored him to deal well with
the girl, for what might be only a pastime of an idle hour with him
might be the breaking of her heart. For I never had a thought of her
truth, or that the worst of harm could come to her--it was only the
unhappiness to her heart I feared. But when I asked him when he
intended to marry her his laughter galled me so that I lost my temper
and told him that I would not stand by and see her life made unhappy.
Then he grew angry too, and in his anger said such cruel things of her
that then and there I swore he should not live to do her harm. God
knows how it came about, for in such moments of passion it is hard to
remember the steps from a word to a blow, but I found myself standing
over his dead body, with my hands crimson with the blood that welled
from his torn throat. We were alone and he was a stranger, with none
of his kin to seek for him and murder does not always out--not all at
once. His bones may be whitening still, for all I know, in the pool of
the river where I left him. No one suspected his absence, or why it
was, except my poor Mabel, and she dared not speak. But it was all in
vain, for when I came back again after an absence of months--for I
could not live in the place--I learned that her shame had come and
that she had died in it. Hitherto I had been borne up by the thought
that my ill deed had saved her future, but now, when I learned that I
had been too late, and that my poor love was smirched with that man's
sin, I fled away with the sense of my useless guilt upon me more
heavily than I could bear. Ah! sir, you that have not done such a sin
don't know what it is to carry it with you. You may think that custom
makes it easy to you, but it is not so. It grows and grows with every
hour, till it becomes intolerable, and with it growing, too, the
feeling that you must for ever stand outside Heaven. You don't know
what that means, and I pray God that you never may. Ordinary men, to
whom all things are possible, don't often, if ever, think of Heaven.
It is a name, and nothing more, and they are content to wait and let
things be, but to those who are doomed to be shut out for ever you
cannot think what it means, you cannot guess or measure the terrible
endless longing to see the gates opened, and to be able to join the
white figures within.

'And this brings me to my dream. It seemed that the portal was before
me, with great gates of massive steel with bars of the thickness of a
mast, rising to the very clouds, and so close that between them was
just a glimpse of a crystal grotto, on whose shining walls were
figured many white-clad forms with faces radiant with joy. When I
stood before the gate my heart and my soul were so full of rapture and
longing that I forgot. And there stood at the gate two mighty angels
with sweeping wings, and, oh! so stern of countenance. They held each
in one hand a flaming sword, and in the other the latchet, which moved
to and fro at their lightest touch. Nearer were figures all draped in
black, with heads covered so that only the eyes were seen, and they
handed to each who came white garments such as the angels wear. A low
murmur came that told that all should put on their own robes, and
without soil, or the angels would not pass them in, but would smite
them down with the flaming swords. I was eager to don my own garment,
and hurriedly threw it over me and stepped swiftly to the gate; but it
moved not, and the angels, loosing the latchet, pointed to my dress, I
looked down, and was aghast, for the whole robe was smeared with
blood. My hands were red; they glittered with the blood that dripped
from them as on that day by the river bank. And then the angels raised
their flaming swords to smite me down, and the horror was complete--I
awoke. Again, and again, and again, that awful dream comes to me. I
never learn from the experience, I never remember, but at the
beginning the hope is ever there to make the end more appalling; and I
know that the dream does not come out of the common darkness where the
dreams abide, but that it is sent from God as a punishment! Never,
never shall I be able to pass the gate, for the soil on the angel
garments must ever come from these bloody hands!'

I listened as in a spell as Jacob Settle spoke. There was something so
far away in the tone of his voice--something so dreamy and mystic in
the eyes that looked as if through me at some spirit beyond--something
so lofty in his very diction and in such marked contrast to his
workworn clothes and his poor surroundings that I wondered if the
whole thing were not a dream.

We were both silent for a long time. I kept looking at the man before
me in growing wonderment. Now that his confession had been made, his
soul, which had been crushed to the very earth, seemed to leap back
again to uprightness with some resilient force. I suppose I ought to
have been horrified with his story, but, strange to say, I was not. It
certainly is not pleasant to be made the recipient of the confidence
of a murderer, but this poor fellow seemed to have had, not only so
much provocation, but so much self-denying purpose in his deed of
blood that I did not feel called upon to pass judgment upon him. My
purpose was to comfort, so I spoke out with what calmness I could, for
my heart was beating fast and heavily:

'You need not despair, Jacob Settle. God is very good, and His mercy
is great. Live on and work on in the hope that some day you may feel
that you have atoned for the past.' Here I paused, for I could see
that deep, natural sleep this time, was creeping upon him. 'Go to
sleep,' I said; 'I shall watch with you here and we shall have no more
evil dreams tonight.'

He made an effort to pull himself together, and answered:

'I don't know how to thank you for your goodness to me this night, but
I think you had best leave me now. I'll try and sleep this out; I feel
a weight off my mind since I have told you all. If there's anything of
the man left in me, I must try and fight out life alone.'

'I'll go tonight, as you wish it,' I said; 'but take my advice, and do
not live in such a solitary way. Go among men and women; live among
them. Share their joys and sorrows, and it will help you to forget.
This solitude will make you melancholy mad.'

'I will!' he answered, half unconsciously, for sleep was overmastering
him.

I turned to go, and he looked after me. When I had touched the latch I
dropped it, and, coming back to the bed, held out my hand. He grasped
it with both his as he rose to a sitting posture, and I said my
goodnight, trying to cheer him:

'Heart, man, heart! There is work in the world for you to do, Jacob
Settle. You can wear those white robes yet and pass through that gate
of steel!'

Then I left him.

A week after I found his cottage deserted, and on asking at the works
was told that he had 'gone north', no one exactly knew whither.

Two years afterwards, I was staying for a few days with my friend Dr.
Munro in Glasgow. He was a busy man, and could not spare much time for
going about with me, so I spent my days in excursions to the Trossachs
and Loch Katrine and down the Clyde. On the second last evening of my
stay I came back somewhat later than I had arranged, but found that
my host was late too. The maid told me that he had been sent for to
the hospital--a case of accident at the gas-works, and the dinner was
postponed an hour; so telling her I would stroll down to find her
master and walk back with him, I went out. At the hospital I found him
washing his hands preparatory to starting for home. Casually, I asked
him what his case was.

'Oh, the usual thing! A rotten rope and men's lives of no account. Two
men were working in a gasometer, when the rope that held their
scaffolding broke. It must have occurred just before the dinner hour,
for no one noticed their absence till the men had returned. There was
about seven feet of water in the gasometer, so they had a hard fight
for it, poor fellows. However, one of them was alive, just alive, but
we have had a hard job to pull him through. It seems that he owes his
life to his mate, for I have never heard of greater heroism. They swam
together while their strength lasted, but at the end they were so done
up that even the lights above, and the men slung with ropes, coming
down to help them, could not keep them up. But one of them stood on
the bottom and held up his comrade over his head, and those few
breaths made all the difference between life and death. They were a
shocking sight when they were taken out, for that water is like a
purple dye with the gas and the tar. The man upstairs looked as if he
had been washed in blood. Ugh!'

'And the other?'

'Oh, he's worse still. But he must have been a very noble fellow. That
struggle under the water must have been fearful; one can see that by
the way the blood has been drawn from the extremities. It makes the
idea of the _Stigmata_ possible to look at him. Resolution like this
could, you would think, do anything in the world. Ay! it might almost
unbar the gates of Heaven. Look here, old man, it is not a very
pleasant sight, especially just before dinner, but you are a writer,
and this is an odd case. Here is something you would not like to miss,
for in all human probability you will never see anything like it
again.' While he was speaking he had brought me into the mortuary of
the hospital.

On the bier lay a body covered with a white sheet, which was wrapped
close round it.

'Looks like a chrysalis, don't it? I say, Jack, if there be anything
in the old myth that a soul is typified by a butterfly, well, then the
one that this chrysalis sent forth was a very noble specimen and took
all the sunlight on its wings. See here!' He uncovered the face.
Horrible, indeed, it looked, as though stained with blood. But I knew
him at once, Jacob Settle! My friend pulled the winding sheet further
down.

The hands were crossed on the purple breast as they had been
reverently placed by some tender-hearted person. As I saw them my
heart throbbed with a great exultation, for the memory of his
harrowing dream rushed across my mind. There was no stain now on those
poor, brave hands, for they were blanched white as snow.

And somehow as I looked I felt that the evil dream was all over. That
noble soul had won a way through the gate at last. The white robe had
now no stain from the hands that had put it on.




Crooken Sands


Mr Arthur Fernlee Markam, who took what was known as the Red House
above the Mains of Crooken, was a London merchant, and being
essentially a cockney, thought it necessary when he went for the
summer holidays to Scotland to provide an entire rig-out as a Highland
chieftain, as manifested in chromolithographs and on the music-hall
stage. He had once seen in the Empire the Great Prince--'The Bounder
King'--bring down the house by appearing as 'The MacSlogan of that
Ilk,' and singing the celebrated Scotch song, 'There's naething like
haggis to mak a mon dry!' and he had ever since preserved in his mind
a faithful image of the picturesque and warlike appearance which he
presented. Indeed, if the true inwardness of Mr. Markam's mind on the
subject of his selection of Aberdeenshire as a summer resort were
known, it would be found that in the foreground of the holiday
locality which his fancy painted stalked the many hued figure of the
MacSlogan of that Ilk. However, be this as it may, a very kind
fortune--certainly so far as external beauty was concerned--led him to
the choice of Crooken Bay. It is a lovely spot, between Aberdeen and
Peterhead, just under the rock-bound headland whence the long,
dangerous reefs known as The Spurs run out into the North Sea.
Between this and the 'Mains of Crooken'--a village sheltered by the
northern cliffs--lies the deep bay, backed with a multitude of
bent-grown dunes where the rabbits are to be found in thousands. Thus
at either end of the bay is a rocky promontory, and when the dawn or
the sunset falls on the rocks of red syenite the effect is very
lovely. The bay itself is floored with level sand and the tide runs
far out, leaving a smooth waste of hard sand on which are dotted here
and there the stake nets and bag nets of the salmon fishers. At one
end of the bay there is a little group or cluster of rocks whose heads
are raised something above high water, except when in rough weather
the waves come over them green. At low tide they are exposed down to
sand level; and here is perhaps the only little bit of dangerous sand
on this part of the eastern coast. Between the rocks, which are apart
about some fifty feet, is a small quicksand, which, like the Goodwins,
is dangerous only with the incoming tide. It extends outwards till it
is lost in the sea, and inwards till it fades away in the hard sand of
the upper beach. On the slope of the hill which rises beyond the
dunes, midway between the Spurs and the Port of Crooken, is the Red
House. It rises from the midst of a clump of fir-trees which protect
it on three sides, leaving the whole sea front open. A trim
old-fashioned garden stretches down to the roadway, on crossing which
a grassy path, which can be used for light vehicles, threads a way to
the shore, winding amongst the sand hills.

When the Markam family arrived at the Red House after their thirty-six
hours of pitching on the Aberdeen steamer _Ban Righ_ from Blackwall,
with the subsequent train to Yellon and drive of a dozen miles, they
all agreed that they had never seen a more delightful spot. The
general satisfaction was more marked as at that very time none of the
family were, for several reasons, inclined to find favourable anything
or any place over the Scottish border. Though the family was a large
one, the prosperity of the business allowed them all sorts of personal
luxuries, amongst which was a wide latitude in the way of dress. The
frequency of the Markam girls' new frocks was a source of envy to
their bosom friends and of joy to themselves.

Arthur Fernlee Markam had not taken his family into his confidence
regarding his new costume. He was not quite certain that he should be
free from ridicule, or at least from sarcasm, and as he was sensitive
on the subject, he thought it better to be actually in the suitable
environment before he allowed the full splendour to burst upon them.
He had taken some pains, to insure the completeness of the Highland
costume. For the purpose he had paid many visits to 'The Scotch
All-Wool Tartan Clothing Mart' which had been lately established in
Copthall-court by the Messrs. MacCallum More and Roderick MacDhu. He
had anxious consultations with the head of the firm--MacCallum as he
called himself, resenting any such additions as 'Mr.' or 'Esquire.'
The known stock of buckles, buttons, straps, brooches and ornaments of
all kinds were examined in critical detail; and at last an eagle's
feather of sufficiently magnificent proportions was discovered, and
the equipment was complete. It was only when he saw the finished
costume, with the vivid hues of the tartan seemingly modified into
comparative sobriety by the multitude of silver fittings, the
cairngorm brooches, the philibeg, dirk and sporran that he was fully
and absolutely satisfied with his choice. At first he had thought of
the Royal Stuart dress tartan, but abandoned it on the MacCallum
pointing out that if he should happen to be in the neighbourhood of
Balmoral it might lead to complications. The MacCallum, who, by the
way, spoke with a remarkable cockney accent, suggested other plaids in
turn; but now that the other question of accuracy had been raised, Mr.
Markam foresaw difficulties if he should by chance find himself in the
locality of the clan whose colours he had usurped. The MacCallum at
last undertook to have, at Markam's expense, a special pattern woven
which would not be exactly the same as any existing tartan, though
partaking of the characteristics of many. It was based on the Royal
Stuart, but contained suggestions as to simplicity of pattern from the
Macalister and Ogilvie clans, and as to neutrality of colour from the
clans of Buchanan, Macbeth, Chief of Macintosh and Macleod. When the
specimen had been shown to Markam he had feared somewhat lest it
should strike the eye of his domestic circle as gaudy; but as Roderick
MacDhu fell into perfect ecstasies over its beauty he did not make any
objection to the completion of the piece. He thought, and wisely, that
if a genuine Scotchman like MacDhu liked it, it must be
right--especially as the junior partner was a man very much of his own
build and appearance. When the MacCallum was receiving his
cheque--which, by the way, was a pretty stiff one--he remarked:

'I've taken the liberty of having some more of the stuff woven in case
you or any of your friends should want it.' Markam was gratified, and
told him that he should be only too happy if the beautiful stuff which
they had originated between them should become a favourite, as he had
no doubt it would in time. He might make and sell as much as he would.

Markam tried the dress on in his office one evening after the clerks
had all gone home. He was pleased, though a little frightened, at the
result. The MacCallum had done his work thoroughly, and there was
nothing omitted that could add to the martial dignity of the wearer.

'I shall not, of course, take the claymore and the pistols with me on
ordinary occasions,' said Markam to himself as he began to undress. He
determined that he would wear the dress for the first time on landing
in Scotland, and accordingly on the morning when the _Ban Righ_ was
hanging off the Girdle Ness lighthouse, waiting for the tide to enter
the port of Aberdeen, he emerged from his cabin in all the gaudy
splendour of his new costume. The first comment he heard was from one
of his own sons, who did not recognise him at first.

'Here's a guy! Great Scott! It's the governor!' And the boy fled
forthwith and tried to bury his laughter under a cushion in the
saloon. Markam was a good sailor and had not suffered from the
pitching of the boat, so that his naturally rubicund face was even
more rosy by the conscious blush which suffused his cheeks when he had
found himself at once the cynosure of all eyes. He could have wished
that he had not been so bold for he knew from the cold that there was
a big bare spot under one side of his jauntily worn Glengarry cap.
However, he faced the group of strangers boldly. He was not,
outwardly, upset even when some of the comments reached his ears.

'He's off his bloomin' chump,' said a cockney in a suit of exaggerated
plaid.

'There's flies on him,' said a tall thin Yankee, pale with
sea-sickness, who was on his way to take up his residence for a time
as close as he could get to the gates of Balmoral.

'Happy thought! Let us fill our mulls; now's the chance!' said a
young Oxford man on his way home to Inverness. But presently Mr.
Markam heard the voice of his eldest daughter.

'Where is he? Where is he?' and she came tearing along the deck with
her hat blowing behind her. Her face showed signs of agitation, for
her mother had just been telling her of her father's condition; but
when she saw him she instantly burst into laughter so violent that it
ended in a fit of hysterics. Something of the same kind happened to
each of the other children. When they had all had their turn Mr.
Markam went to his cabin and sent his wife's maid to tell each member
of the family that he wanted to see them at once. They all made their
appearance, suppressing their feelings as well as they could. He said
to them very quietly:

'My dears, don't I provide you all with ample allowances?'

'Yes, father!' they all answered gravely, 'no one could be more
generous!'

'Don't I let you dress as you please?'

'Yes, father!'--this a little sheepishly.

'Then, my dears, don't you think it would be nicer and kinder of you
not to try and make me feel uncomfortable, even if I do assume a dress
which is ridiculous in your eyes, though quite common enough in the
country where we are about to sojourn?' There was no answer except
that which appeared in their hanging heads. He was a good father and
they all knew it. He was quite satisfied and went on:

'There, now, run away and enjoy yourselves! We shan't have another
word about it.' Then he went on deck again and stood bravely the fire
of ridicule which he recognised around him, though nothing more was
said within his hearing.

The astonishment and the amusement which his get-up occasioned on the
_Ban Righ_ was, however, nothing to that which it created in Aberdeen.
The boys and loafers, and women with babies, who waited at the landing
shed, followed _en masse_ as the Markam party took their way to the
railway station; even the porters with their old-fashioned knots and
their new-fashioned barrows, who await the traveller at the foot of
the gang-plank, followed in wondering delight. Fortunately the
Peterhead train was just about to start, so that the martyrdom was not
unnecessarily prolonged. In the carriage the glorious Highland costume
was unseen, and as there were but few persons at the station at
Yellon, all went well there. When, however, the carriage drew near the
Mains of Crooken and the fisher folk had run to their doors to see who
it was that was passing, the excitement exceeded all bounds. The
children with one impulse waved their bonnets and ran shouting behind
the carriage; the men forsook their nets and their baiting and
followed; the women clutched their babies, and followed also. The
horses were tired after their long journey to Yellon and back, and the
hill was steep, so that there was ample time for the crowd to gather
and even to pass on ahead.

Mrs. Markam and the elder girls would have liked to make some protest
or to do something to relieve their feelings of chagrin at the
ridicule which they saw on all faces, but there was a look of fixed
determination on the face of the seeming Highlander which awed them a
little, and they were silent. It might have been that the eagle's
feather, even when arising above the bald head, the cairngorm brooch
even on the fat shoulder, and the claymore, dirk and pistols, even
when belted round the extensive paunch and protruding from the
stocking on the sturdy calf, fulfilled their existence as symbols of
martial and terrifying import! When the party arrived at the gate of
the Red House there awaited them a crowd of Crooken inhabitants,
hatless and respectfully silent; the remainder of the population was
painfully toiling up the hill. The silence was broken by only one
sound, that of a man with a deep voice.

'Man! but he's forgotten the pipes!'

The servants had arrived some days before, and all things were in
readiness. In the glow consequent on a good lunch after a hard journey
all the disagreeables of travel and all the chagrin consequent on the
adoption of the obnoxious costume were forgotten.

That afternoon Markam, still clad in full array, walked through the
Mains of Crooken. He was all alone, for, strange to say, his wife and
both daughters had sick headaches, and were, as he was told, lying
down to rest after the fatigue of the journey. His eldest son, who
claimed to be a young man, had gone out by himself to explore the
surroundings of the place, and one of the boys could not be found. The
other boy, on being told that his father had sent for him to come for
a walk, had managed--by accident, of course--to fall into the water
butt, and had to be dried and rigged out afresh. His clothes not
having been as yet unpacked this was of course impossible without
delay.

Mr. Markam was not quite satisfied with his walk. He could not meet
any of his neighbours. It was not that there were not enough people
about, for every house and cottage seemed to be full; but the people
when in the open were either in their doorways some distance behind
him, or on the roadway a long distance in front. As he passed he
could see the tops of heads and the whites of eyes in the windows or
round the corners of doors. The only interview which he had was
anything but a pleasant one. This was with an odd sort of old man who
was hardly ever heard to speak except to join in the 'Amens' in the
meeting-house. His sole occupation seemed to be to wait at the window
of the post-office from eight o'clock in the morning till the arrival
of the mail at one, when he carried the letter-bag to a neighbouring
baronial castle. The remainder of his day was spent on a seat in a
draughty part of the port, where the offal of the fish, the refuse of
the bait, and the house rubbish was thrown, and where the ducks were
accustomed to hold high revel.

When Saft Tammie beheld him coming he raised his eyes, which were
generally fixed on the nothing which lay on the roadway opposite his
seat, and, seeming dazzled as if by a burst of sunshine, rubbed them
and shaded them with his hand. Then he started up and raised his hand
aloft in a denunciatory manner as he spoke:--

'"Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher. All is vanity." Mon, be
warned in time! "Behold the lilies of the field, they toil not,
neither do they spin, yet Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
like one of these." Mon! Mon! Thy vanity is as the quicksand which
swallows up all which comes within its spell. Beware vanity! Beware
the quicksand, which yawneth for thee, and which will swallow thee up!
See thyself! Learn thine own vanity! Meet thyself face to face, and
then in that moment thou shalt learn the fatal force of thy vanity.
Learn it, know it, and repent ere the quicksand swallow thee!' Then
without another word he went back to his seat and sat there immovable
and expressionless as before.

Markam could not but feel a little upset by this tirade. Only that it
was spoken by a seeming madman, he would have put it down to some
eccentric exhibition of Scottish humour or impudence; but the gravity
of the message--for it seemed nothing else--made such a reading
impossible. He was, however, determined not to give in to ridicule,
and although he had not yet seen anything in Scotland to remind him
even of a kilt, he determined to wear his Highland dress. When he
returned home, in less than half-an-hour, he found that every member
of the family was, despite the headaches, out taking a walk. He took
the opportunity afforded by their absence of locking himself in his
dressing-room, took off the Highland dress, and, putting on a suit of
flannels, lit a cigar and had a snooze. He was awakened by the noise
of the family coming in, and at once donning his dress made his
appearance in the drawing-room for tea.

He did not go out again that afternoon; but after dinner he put on his
dress again--he had, of course dressed for dinner as usual--and went
by himself for a walk on the sea-shore. He had by this time come to
the conclusion that he would get by degrees accustomed to the Highland
dress before making it his ordinary wear. The moon was up and he
easily followed the path through the sand-hills, and shortly struck
the shore. The tide was out and the beach firm as a rock, so he
strolled southwards to nearly the end of the bay. Here he was
attracted by two isolated rocks some little way out from the edge of
the dunes, so he strolled towards them. When he reached the nearest
one he climbed it, and, sitting there elevated some fifteen or twenty
feet over the waste of sand, enjoyed the lovely, peaceful prospect.
The moon was rising behind the headland of Pennyfold, and its light
was just touching the top of the furthermost rock of the Spurs some
three-quarters of a mile out; the rest of the rocks were in dark
shadow. As the moon rose over the headland, the rocks of the Spurs and
then the beach by degrees became flooded with light.

For a good while Mr. Markam sat and looked at the rising moon and the
growing area of light which followed its rise. Then he turned and
faced eastwards and sat with his chin in his hand looking seawards,
and revelling in the peace and beauty and freedom of the scene. The
roar of London--the darkness and the strife and weariness of London
life--seemed to have passed quite away, and he lived at the moment a
freer and higher life. He looked at the glistening water as it stole
its way over the flat waste of sand, coming closer and closer
insensibly--the tide had turned. Presently he heard a distant shouting
along the beach very far off.

'The fishermen calling to each other,' he said to himself and looked
around. As he did so he got a horrible shock, for though just then a
cloud sailed across the moon he saw, in spite of the sudden darkness
around him, his own image. For an instant, on the top of the opposite
rock he could see the bald back of the head and the Glengarry cap with
the immense eagle's feather. As he staggered back his foot slipped,
and he began to slide down towards the sand between the two rocks. He
took no concern as to falling, for the sand was really only a few feet
below him, and his mind was occupied with the figure or simulacrum of
himself, which had already disappeared. As the easiest way of reaching
_terra firma_ he prepared to jump the remainder of the distance. All
this had taken but a second, but the brain works quickly, and even as
he gathered himself for the spring he saw the sand below him lying so
marbly level shake and shiver in an odd way. A sudden fear overcame
him; his knees failed, and instead of jumping he slid miserably down
the rock, scratching his bare legs as he went. His feet touched the
sand--went through it like water--and he was down below his knees
before he realised that he was in a quicksand. Wildly he grasped at
the rock to keep himself from sinking further, and fortunately there
was a jutting spur or edge which he was able to grasp instinctively.
To this he clung in grim desperation. He tried to shout, but his
breath would not come, till after a great effort his voice rang out.
Again he shouted, and it seemed as if the sound of his own voice gave
him new courage, for he was able to hold on to the rock for a longer
time than he thought possible--though he held on only in blind
desperation. He was, however, beginning to find his grasp weakening,
when, joy of joys! his shout was answered by a rough voice from just
above him.

'God be thankit, I'm nae too late!' and a fisherman with great
thigh-boots came hurriedly climbing over the rock. In an instant he
recognised the gravity of the danger, and with a cheering 'Haud fast,
mon! I'm comin'!' scrambled down till he found a firm foothold. Then
with one strong hand holding the rock above, he leaned down, and
catching Markam's wrist, called out to him, 'Haud to me, mon! Haud to
me wi' ither hond!'

Then he lent his great strength, and with a steady, sturdy pull,
dragged him out of the hungry quicksand and placed him safe upon the
rock. Hardly giving him time to draw breath, he pulled and pushed
him--never letting him go for an instant--over the rock into the firm
sand beyond it, and finally deposited him, still shaking from the
magnitude of his danger, high upon the beach. Then he began to speak:

'Mon! but I was just in time. If I had no laucht at yon foolish lads
and begun to rin at the first you'd a bin sinkin' doon to the bowels
o' the airth be the noo! Wully Beagrie thocht you was a ghaist, and
Tom MacPhail swore ye was only like a goblin on a puddick-steel! "Na!"
said I. "Yon's but the daft Englishman--the loony that had escapit
frae the waxwarks." I was thinkin' that bein' strange and silly--if
not a whole-made feel--ye'd no ken the ways o' the quicksan'! I
shouted till warn ye, and then ran to drag ye aff, if need be. But God
be thankit, be ye fule or only half-daft wi' yer vanity, that I was no
that late!' and he reverently lifted his cap as he spoke.

Mr. Markam was deeply touched and thankful for his escape from a
horrible death; but the sting of the charge of vanity thus made once
more against him came through his humility. He was about to reply
angrily, when suddenly a great awe fell upon him as he remembered the
warning words of the half-crazy letter-carrier: 'Meet thyself face to
face, and repent ere the quicksand shall swallow thee!'

Here, too, he remembered the image of himself that he had seen and the
sudden danger from the deadly quicksand that had followed. He was
silent a full minute, and then said:

'My good fellow, I owe you my life!'

The answer came with reverence from the hardy fisherman, 'Na! Na! Ye
owe that to God; but, as for me, I'm only too glad till be the humble
instrument o' His mercy.'

'But you will let me thank you,' said Mr. Markam, taking both the
great hands of his deliverer in his and holding them tight. 'My heart
is too full as yet, and my nerves are too much shaken to let me say
much; but, believe me, I am very, very grateful!' It was quite evident
that the poor old fellow was deeply touched, for the tears were
running down his cheeks.

The fisherman said, with a rough but true courtesy:

'Ay, sir! thank me and ye will--if it'll do yer poor heart good. An'
I'm thinking that if it were me I'd be thankful too. But, sir, as for
me I need no thanks. I am glad, so I am!'

That Arthur Fernlee Markam was really thankful and grateful was shown
practically later on. Within a week's time there sailed into Port
Crooken the finest fishing smack that had ever been seen in the
harbour of Peterhead. She was fully found with sails and gear of all
kinds, and with nets of the best. Her master and men went away by the
coach, after having left with the salmon-fisher's wife the papers
which made her over to him.

As Mr. Markam and the salmon-fisher walked together along the shore
the former asked his companion not to mention the fact that he had
been in such imminent danger, for that it would only distress his dear
wife and children. He said that he would warn them all of the
quicksand, and for that purpose he, then and there, asked questions
about it till he felt that his information on the subject was
complete. Before they parted he asked his companion if he had happened
to see a second figure, dressed like himself on the other rock as he
had approached to succour him.

'Na! Na!' came the answer, 'there is nae sic another fule in these
parts. Nor has there been since the time o' Jamie Fleeman--him that
was fule to the Laird o' Udny. Why, mon! sic a heathenish dress as ye
have on till ye has nae been seen in these pairts within the memory o'
mon. An' I'm thinkin' that sic a dress never was for sittin' on the
cauld rock, as ye done beyont. Mon! but do ye no fear the rheumatism
or the lumbagy wi' floppin' doon on to the cauld stanes wi' yer bare
flesh? I was thinking that it was daft ye waur when I see ye the
mornin' doon be the port, but it's fule or eediot ye maun be for the
like o' thot!' Mr. Markam did not care to argue the point, and as they
were now close to his own home he asked the salmon-fisher to have a
glass of whisky--which he did--and they parted for the night. He took
good care to warn all his family of the quicksand, telling them that
he had himself been in some danger from it.

All that night he never slept. He heard the hours strike one after the
other; but try how he would he could not get to sleep. Over and over
again he went through the horrible episode of the quicksand, from the
time that Saft Tammie had broken his habitual silence to preach to him
of the sin of vanity and to warn him. The question kept ever arising
in his mind: 'Am I then so vain as to be in the ranks of the foolish?'
and the answer ever came in the words of the crazy prophet: '"Vanity
of vanities! All is vanity." Meet thyself face to face, and repent ere
the quicksand shall swallow thee!' Somehow a feeling of doom began to
shape itself in his mind that he would yet perish in that same
quicksand, for there he had already met himself face to face.

In the grey of the morning he dozed off, but it was evident that he
continued the subject in his dreams, for he was fully awakened by his
wife, who said:

'Do sleep quietly! That blessed Highland suit has got on your brain.
Don't talk in your sleep, if you can help it!' He was somehow
conscious of a glad feeling, as if some terrible weight had been
lifted from him, but he did not know any cause of it. He asked his
wife what he had said in his sleep, and she answered:

'You said it often enough, goodness knows, for one to remember
it--"Not face to face! I saw the eagle plume over the bald head! There
is hope yet! Not face to face!" Go to sleep! Do!' And then he did go
to sleep, for he seemed to realise that the prophecy of the crazy man
had not yet been fulfilled. He had not met himself face to face--as
yet at all events.

He was awakened early by a maid who came to tell him that there was a
fisherman at the door who wanted to see him. He dressed himself as
quickly as he could--for he was not yet expert with the Highland
dress--and hurried down, not wishing to keep the salmon-fisher
waiting. He was surprised and not altogether pleased to find that his
visitor was none other than Saft Tammie, who at once opened fire on
him:

'I maun gang awa' t' the post; but I thocht that I would waste an hour
on ye, and ca' roond just to see if ye waur still that fou wi' vanity
as on the nicht gane by. An I see that ye've no learned the lesson.
Well! the time is comin', sure eneucht! However I have all the time i'
the marnins to my ain sel', so I'll aye look roond jist till see how
ye gang yer ain gait to the quicksan', and then to the de'il! I'm aff
till ma wark the noo!' And he went straightway, leaving Mr. Markam
considerably vexed, for the maids within earshot were vainly trying to
conceal their giggles. He had fairly made up his mind to wear on that
day ordinary clothes, but the visit of Saft Tammie reversed his
decision. He would show them all that he was not a coward, and he
would go on as he had begun--come what might. When he came to
breakfast in full martial panoply the children, one and all, held down
their heads and the backs of their necks became very red indeed. As,
however, none of them laughed--except Titus, the youngest boy, who was
seized with a fit of hysterical choking and was promptly banished from
the room--he could not reprove them, but began to break his egg with a
sternly determined air. It was unfortunate that as his wife was
handing him a cup of tea one of the buttons of his sleeve caught in
the lace of her morning wrapper, with the result that the hot tea was
spilt over his bare knees. Not unnaturally, he made use of a swear
word, whereupon his wife, somewhat nettled, spoke out:

'Well, Arthur, if you will make such an idiot of yourself with that
ridiculous costume what else can you expect? You are not accustomed to
it--and you never will be!' In answer he began an indignant speech
with: 'Madam!' but he got no further, for now that the subject was
broached, Mrs. Markam intended to have her say out. It was not a
pleasant say, and, truth to tell, it was not said in a pleasant
manner. A wife's manner seldom is pleasant when she undertakes to tell
what she considers 'truths' to her husband. The result was that Arthur
Fernlee Markam undertook, then and there, that during his stay in
Scotland he would wear no other costume than the one she abused.
Woman-like his wife had the last word--given in this case with tears:

'Very well, Arthur! Of course you will do as you choose. Make me as
ridiculous as you can, and spoil the poor girls' chances in life.
Young men don't seem to care, as a general rule, for an idiot
father-in-law! But I must warn you that your vanity will some day get
a rude shock--if indeed you are not before then in an asylum or dead!'

It was manifest after a few days that Mr. Markam would have to take
the major part of his outdoor exercise by himself. The girls now and
again took a walk with him, chiefly in the early morning or late at
night, or on a wet day when there would be no one about; they
professed to be willing to go out at all times, but somehow something
always seemed to occur to prevent it. The boys could never be found at
all on such occasions, and as to Mrs. Markam she sternly refused to go
out with him on any consideration so long as he should continue to
make a fool of himself. On the Sunday he dressed himself in his
habitual broadcloth, for he rightly felt that church was not a place
for angry feelings; but on Monday morning he resumed his Highland
garb. By this time he would have given a good deal if he had never
thought of the dress, but his British obstinacy was strong, and he
would not give in. Saft Tammie called at his house every morning, and,
not being able to see him nor to have any message taken to him, used
to call back in the afternoon when the letter-bag had been delivered
and watched for his going out. On such occasions he never failed to
warn him against his vanity in the same words which he had used at the
first. Before many days were over Mr. Markam had come to look upon him
as little short of a scourge.

By the time the week was out the enforced partial solitude, the
constant chagrin, and the never-ending brooding which was thus
engendered, began to make Mr. Markam quite ill. He was too proud to
take any of his family into his confidence since they had in his view
treated him very badly. Then he did not sleep well at night, and when
he did sleep he had constantly bad dreams. Merely to assure himself
that his pluck was not failing him he made it a practice to visit the
quicksand at least once every day; he hardly ever failed to go there
the last thing at night. It was perhaps this habit that wrought the
quicksand with its terrible experience so perpetually into his dreams.
More and more vivid these became, till on waking at times he could
hardly realise that he had not been actually in the flesh to visit the
fatal spot. He sometimes thought that he might have been walking in
his sleep.

One night his dream was so vivid that when he awoke he could not
believe that it had only been a dream. He shut his eyes again and
again, but each time the vision, if it was a vision, or the reality,
if it was a reality, would rise before him. The moon was shining full
and yellow over the quicksand as he approached it; he could see the
expanse of light shaken and disturbed and full of black shadows as the
liquid sand quivered and trembled and wrinkled and eddied as was its
wont between its pauses of marble calm. As he drew close to it another
figure came towards it from the opposite side with equal footsteps. He
saw that it was his own figure, his very self, and in silent terror,
compelled by what force he knew not, he advanced--charmed as the bird
is by the snake, mesmerised or hypnotised--to meet this other self. As
he felt the yielding sand closing over him he awoke in the agony of
death, trembling with fear, and, strange to say, with the silly man's
prophecy seeming to sound in his ears: '"Vanity of vanities! All is
vanity!" See thyself and repent ere the quicksand swallow thee!'

So convinced was he that this was no dream that he arose, early as it
was, and dressing himself without disturbing his wife took his way to
the shore. His heart fell when he came across a series of footsteps on
the sands, which he at once recognised as his own. There was the same
wide heel, the same square toe; he had no doubt now that he had
actually been there, and half horrified, and half in a state of dreamy
stupor, he followed the footsteps, and found them lost in the edge of
the yielding quicksand. This gave him a terrible shock, for there were
no return steps marked on the sand, and he felt that there was some
dread mystery which he could not penetrate, and the penetration of
which would, he feared, undo him.

In this state of affairs he took two wrong courses. Firstly he kept
his trouble to himself, and, as none of his family had any clue to it,
every innocent word or expression which they used supplied fuel to the
consuming fire of his imagination. Secondly he began to read books
professing to bear upon the mysteries of dreaming and of mental
phenomena generally, with the result that every wild imagination of
every crank or half-crazy philosopher became a living germ of unrest
in the fertilising soil of his disordered brain. Thus negatively and
positively all things began to work to a common end. Not the least of
his disturbing causes was Saft Tammie, who had now become at certain
times of the day a fixture at his gate. After a while, being
interested in the previous state of this individual, he made inquiries
regarding his past with the following result.

Saft Tammie was popularly believed to be the son of a laird in one of
the counties round the Firth of Forth. He had been partially educated
for the ministry, but for some cause which no one ever knew threw up
his prospects suddenly, and, going to Peterhead in its days of whaling
prosperity, had there taken service on a whaler. Here off and on he
had remained for some years, getting gradually more and more silent in
his habits, till finally his shipmates protested against so taciturn a
mate, and he had found service amongst the fishing smacks of the
northern fleet. He had worked for many years at the fishing with
always the reputation of being 'a wee bit daft,' till at length he had
gradually settled down at Crooken, where the laird, doubtless knowing
something of his family history, had given him a job which practically
made him a pensioner. The minister who gave the information finished
thus:--

'It is a very strange thing, but the man seems to have some odd kind
of gift. Whether it be that "second sight" which we Scotch people are
so prone to believe in, or some other occult form of knowledge, I know
not, but nothing of a disastrous tendency ever occurs in this place
but the men with whom he lives are able to quote after the event some
saying of his which certainly appears to have foretold it. He gets
uneasy or excited--wakes up, in fact--when death is in the air!'

This did not in any way tend to lessen Mr. Markam's concern, but on
the contrary seemed to impress the prophecy more deeply on his mind.
Of all the books which he had read on his new subject of study none
interested him so much as a German one _Die Dppleganger_, by Dr.
Heinrich von Aschenberg, formerly of Bonn. Here he learned for the
first time of cases where men had led a double existence--each nature
being quite apart from the other--the body being always a reality with
one spirit, and a simulacrum with the other. Needless to say that Mr.
Markam realised this theory as exactly suiting his own case. The
glimpse which he had of his own back the night of his escape from the
quicksand--his own footmarks disappearing into the quicksand with no
return steps visible--the prophecy of Saft Tammie about his meeting
himself and perishing in the quicksand--all lent aid to the conviction
that he was in his own person an instance of the dppleganger. Being
then conscious of a double life he took steps to prove its existence
to his own satisfaction. To this end on one night before going to bed
he wrote his name in chalk on the soles of his shoes. That night he
dreamed of the quicksand, and of his visiting it--dreamed so vividly
that on walking in the grey of the dawn he could not believe that he
had not been there. Arising, without disturbing his wife, he sought
his shoes.

The chalk signatures were undisturbed! He dressed himself and stole
out softly. This time the tide was in, so he crossed the dunes and
struck the shore on the further side of the quicksand. There, oh,
horror of horrors! he saw his own footprints dying into the abyss!

He went home a desperately sad man. It seemed incredible that he, an
elderly commercial man, who had passed a long and uneventful life in
the pursuit of business in the midst of roaring, practical London,
should thus find himself enmeshed in mystery and horror, and that he
should discover that he had two existences. He could not speak of his
trouble even to his own wife, for well he knew that she would at once
require the fullest particulars of that other life--the one which she
did not know; and that she would at the start not only imagine but
charge him with all manner of infidelities on the head of it. And so
his brooding grew deeper and deeper still. One evening--the tide then
going out and the moon being at the full--he was sitting waiting for
dinner when the maid announced that Saft Tammie was making a
disturbance outside because he would not be let in to see him. He was
very indignant, but did not like the maid to think that he had any
fear on the subject, and so told her to bring him in. Tammie entered,
walking more briskly than ever with his head up and a look of vigorous
decision in the eyes that were so generally cast down. As soon as he
entered he said:

'I have come to see ye once again--once again; and there ye sit, still
just like a cockatoo on a pairch. Weel, mon, I forgie ye! Mind ye
that, I forgie ye!' And without a word more he turned and walked out
of the house, leaving the master in speechless indignation.

After dinner he determined to pay another visit to the quicksand--he
would not allow even to himself that he was afraid to go. And so,
about nine o'clock, in full array, he marched to the beach, and
passing over the sands sat on the skirt of the nearer rock. The full
moon was behind him and its light lit up the bay so that its fringe of
foam, the dark outline of the headland, and the stakes of the
salmon-nets were all emphasised. In the brilliant yellow glow the
lights in the windows of Port Crooken and in those of the distant
castle of the laird trembled like stars through the sky. For a long
time he sat and drank in the beauty of the scene, and his soul seemed
to feel a peace that it had not known for many days. All the pettiness
and annoyance and silly fears of the past weeks seemed blotted out,
and a new holy calm took the vacant place. In this sweet and solemn
mood he reviewed his late action calmly, and felt ashamed of himself
for his vanity and for the obstinacy which had followed it. And then
and there he made up his mind that the present would be the last time
he would wear the costume which had estranged him from those whom he
loved, and which had caused him so many hours and days of chagrin,
vexation, and pain.

But almost as soon as he arrived at this conclusion another voice
seemed to speak within him and mockingly to ask him if he should ever
get the chance to wear the suit again--that it was too late--he had
chosen his course and must now abide the issue.

'It is not too late,' came the quick answer of his better self; and
full of the thought, he rose up to go home and divest himself of the
now hateful costume right away. He paused for one look at the
beautiful scene. The light lay pale and mellow, softening every
outline of rock and tree and house-top, and deepening the shadows into
velvety-black, and lighting, as with a pale flame, the incoming tide,
that now crept fringe-like across the flat waste of sand. Then he left
the rock and stepped out for the shore.

But as he did so a frightful spasm of horror shook him, and for an
instant the blood rushing to his head shut out all the light of the
full moon. Once more he saw that fatal image of himself moving beyond
the quicksand from the opposite rock to the shore. The shock was all
the greater for the contrast with the spell of peace which he had just
enjoyed; and, almost paralysed in every sense, he stood and watched
the fatal vision and the wrinkly, crawling quicksand that seemed to
writhe and yearn for something that lay between. There could be no
mistake this time, for though the moon behind threw the face into
shadow he could see there the same shaven cheeks as his own, and the
small stubby moustache of a few weeks' growth. The light shone on the
brilliant tartan, and on the eagle's plume. Even the bald space at one
side of the Glengarry cap glistened, as did the cairngorm brooch on
the shoulder and the tops of the silver buttons. As he looked he felt
his feet slightly sinking, for he was still near the edge of the belt
of quicksand, and he stepped back. As he did so the other figure
stepped forward, so that the space between them was preserved.

So the two stood facing each other, as though in some weird
fascination; and in the rushing of the blood through his brain Markam
seemed to hear the words of the prophecy: 'See thyself face to face,
and repent ere the quicksand swallow thee.' He did stand face to face
with himself, he had repented--and now he was sinking in the
quicksand! The warning and prophecy were coming true.

Above him the seagulls screamed, circling round the fringe of the
incoming tide, and the sound being entirely mortal recalled him to
himself. On the instant he stepped back a few quick steps, for as yet
only his feet were merged in the soft sand. As he did so the other
figure stepped forward, and coming within the deadly grip of the
quicksand began to sink. It seemed to Markam that he was looking at
himself going down to his doom, and on the instant the anguish of his
soul found vent in a terrible cry. There was at the same instant a
terrible cry from the other figure, and as Markam threw up his hands
the figure did the same. With horror-struck eyes he saw him sink
deeper into the quicksand; and then, impelled by what power he knew
not, he advanced again towards the sand to meet his fate. But as his
more forward foot began to sink he heard again the cries of the
seagulls which seemed to restore his benumbed faculties. With a mighty
effort he drew his foot out of the sand which seemed to clutch it,
leaving his shoe behind, and then in sheer terror he turned and ran
from the place, never stopping till his breath and strength failed
him, and he sank half swooning on the grassy path through the
sandhills.

       *       *       *       *       *

Arthur Markam made up his mind not to tell his family of his terrible
adventure--until at least such time as he should be complete master of
himself. Now that the fatal double--his other self--had been engulfed
in the quicksand he felt something like his old peace of mind.

That night he slept soundly and did not dream at all; and in the
morning was quite his old self. It really seemed as though his newer
and worser self had disappeared for ever; and strangely enough Saft
Tammie was absent from his post that morning and never appeared there
again, but sat in his old place watching nothing, as of old, with
lack-lustre eye. In accordance with his resolution he did not wear his
Highland suit again, but one evening tied it up in a bundle, claymore,
dirk and philibeg and all, and bringing it secretly with him threw it
into the quicksand. With a feeling of intense pleasure he saw it
sucked below the sand, which closed above it into marble smoothness.
Then he went home and announced cheerily to his family assembled for
evening prayers:

'Well! my dears, you will be glad to hear that I have abandoned my
idea of wearing the Highland dress. I see now what a vain old fool I
was and how ridiculous I made myself! You shall never see it again!'

'Where is it, father?' asked one of the girls, wishing to say
something so that such a self-sacrificing announcement as her father's
should not be passed in absolute silence. His answer was so sweetly
given that the girl rose from her seat and came and kissed him. It
was:

'In the quicksand, my dear! and I hope that my worser self is buried
there along with it--for ever.'

       *       *       *       *       *

The remainder of the summer was passed at Crooken with delight by all
the family, and on his return to town Mr. Markam had almost forgotten
the whole of the incident of the quicksand, and all touching on it,
when one day he got a letter from the MacCallum More which caused him
much thought, though he said nothing of it to his family, and left it,
for certain reasons, unanswered. It ran as follows:--

      'The MacCallum More and Roderick MacDhu.
        'The Scotch All-Wool Tartan Clothing Mart.
          Copthall Court, E.C.,
            30th September, 1892.

'Dear Sir,--I trust you will pardon the liberty which I take in
writing to you, but I am desirous of making an inquiry, and I am
informed that you have been sojourning during the summer in
Aberdeenshire (Scotland, N.B.). My partner, Mr. Roderick MacDhu--as he
appears for business reasons on our bill-heads and in our
advertisements, his real name being Emmanuel Moses Marks of
London--went early last month to Scotland (N.B.) for a tour, but as I
have only once heard from him, shortly after his departure, I am
anxious lest any misfortune may have befallen him. As I have been
unable to obtain any news of him on making all inquiries in my power,
I venture to appeal to you. His letter was written in deep dejection
of spirit, and mentioned that he feared a judgment had come upon him
for wishing to appear as a Scotchman on Scottish soil, as he had one
moonlight night shortly after his arrival seen his 'wraith'. He
evidently alluded to the fact that before his departure he had
procured for himself a Highland costume similar to that which we had
the honour to supply to you, with which, as perhaps you will remember,
he was much struck. He may, however, never have worn it, as he was, to
my own knowledge, diffident about putting it on, and even went so far
as to tell me that he would at first only venture to wear it late at
night or very early in the morning, and then only in remote places,
until such time as he should get accustomed to it. Unfortunately he
did not advise me of his route so that I am in complete ignorance of
his whereabouts; and I venture to ask if you may have seen or heard of
a Highland costume similar to your own having been seen anywhere in
the neighbourhood in which I am told you have recently purchased the
estate which you temporarily occupied. I shall not expect an answer to
this letter unless you can give me some information regarding my
friend and partner, so pray do not trouble to reply unless there be
cause. I am encouraged to think that he may have been in your
neighbourhood as, though his letter is not dated, the envelope is
marked with the postmark of "Yellon" which I find is in Aberdeenshire,
and not far from the Mains of Crooken.

  'I have the honour to be, dear sir,
      'Yours very respectfully,
          'JOSHUA SHEENY COHEN BENJAMIN
            '(The MacCallum More.)'

hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I
got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the
streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived
late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The
impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the
East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is
here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish
rule.

We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.
Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or
rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was
very good but thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the
waiter, and he said it was called "paprika hendl," and that, as it was a
national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the
Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I
don't know how I should be able to get on without it.

Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the
British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library
regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the
country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a
nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the
extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,
Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian
mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was
not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the
Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare
with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post
town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter
here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my
travels with Mina.

In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:
Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the
descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the
East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended
from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered
the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I
read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the
horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of
imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (_Mem._, I
must ask the Count all about them.)

I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had
all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my
window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been
the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was
still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous
knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.
I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour
which they said was "mamaliga," and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a
very excellent dish, which they call "impletata." (_Mem._, get recipe
for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little
before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to
the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour
before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the
more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?

All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of
beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the
top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by
rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side
of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and
running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every
station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts
of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I
saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats
and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women
looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy
about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,
and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something
fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there
were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the
Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy
hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous
heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass
nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and
had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very
picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be
set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,
however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural
self-assertion.

It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a
very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the
Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy
existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series
of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate
occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent
a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war
proper being assisted by famine and disease.

Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I
found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of
course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was
evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a
cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white
undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff
fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and
said, "The Herr Englishman?" "Yes," I said, "Jonathan Harker." She
smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,
who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with
a letter:--

     "My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting
     you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will
     start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo
     Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust
     that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you
     will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.

"Your friend,

"DRACULA."


_4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,
directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on
making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and
pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be
true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he
answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old
lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of
way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that
was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could
tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,
and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak
further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask
any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means
comforting.

Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a
very hysterical way:

"Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?" She was in such an excited
state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and
mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I
was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her
that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,
she asked again:

"Do you know what day it is?" I answered that it was the fourth of May.
She shook her head as she said again:

"Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?" On
my saying that I did not understand, she went on:

"It is the eve of St. George's Day. Do you not know that to-night, when
the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have
full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?"
She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but
without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not
to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very
ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business
to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore
tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked
her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and
dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I
did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been
taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it
seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a
state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the
rosary round my neck, and said, "For your mother's sake," and went out
of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting
for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still
round my neck. Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly
traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I
am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should
ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the
coach!

       *       *       *       *       *

_5 May. The Castle._--The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is
high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or
hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are
mixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake,
naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put
down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I
left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they
called "robber steak"--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red
pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple
style of the London cat's meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which
produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not
disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.

When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him
talking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every
now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting
on the bench outside the door--which they call by a name meaning
"word-bearer"--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them
pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for
there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot
dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not
cheering to me, for amongst them were "Ordog"--Satan, "pokol"--hell,
"stregoica"--witch, "vrolok" and "vlkoslak"--both of which mean the same
thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is
either were-wolf or vampire. (_Mem._, I must ask the Count about these
superstitions)

When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time
swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and
pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a
fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at
first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a
charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me,
just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one
seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I
could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I
had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing
themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of
rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the
centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered
the whole front of the box-seat--"gotza" they call them--cracked his big
whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on
our journey.

I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the
scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather
languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have
been able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping
land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned
with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the
road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple,
plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under
the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these
green hills of what they call here the "Mittel Land" ran the road,
losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the
straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the
hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we
seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then
what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no
time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime
excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter
snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in
the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept
in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the
Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,
and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.

Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes
of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right
and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon
them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,
deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where
grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and
pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where
the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the
mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again
the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as
we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered
peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to
be right before us:--

"Look! Isten szek!"--"God's seat!"--and he crossed himself reverently.

As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind
us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was
emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the
sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there
we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed
that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,
and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there
was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even
turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of
devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were
many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here
and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems
shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and
again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant's cart--with its
long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the
road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming
peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their
coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long
staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,
and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the
gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which
ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the
Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of
late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods
that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of
greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a
peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and
grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset
threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the
Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the
hills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could
only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,
but the driver would not hear of it. "No, no," he said; "you must not
walk here; the dogs are too fierce"; and then he added, with what he
evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the
approving smile of the rest--"and you may have enough of such matters
before you go to sleep." The only stop he would make was a moment's
pause to light his lamps.

When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the
passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as
though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully
with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on
to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of
patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the
hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach
rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a
stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared
to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each
side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One
by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed
upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were
certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good
faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of
fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at
Bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.
Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the
passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the
darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either
happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would
give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for
some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on
the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the
air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the
mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got
into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance
which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the
glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light
was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our
hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy
road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.
The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock
my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when
the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I
could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I
thought it was "An hour less than the time." Then turning to me, he said
in German worse than my own:--

"There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will
now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better
the next day." Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and
snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,
amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing
of themselves, a calche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook
us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our
lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and
splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown
beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I
could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red
in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:--

"You are early to-night, my friend." The man stammered in reply:--

"The English Herr was in a hurry," to which the stranger replied:--

"That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot
deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift." As he
spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with
very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my
companions whispered to another the line from Burger's "Lenore":--

    "Denn die Todten reiten schnell"--
    ("For the dead travel fast.")

The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a
gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time
putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. "Give me the Herr's
luggage," said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were
handed out and put in the calche. Then I descended from the side of the
coach, as the calche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a
hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been
prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we
swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam
from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected
against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then
the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept
on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a
strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown
over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in
excellent German:--

"The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all
care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the
country) underneath the seat, if you should require it." I did not take
any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a
little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been
any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that
unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,
then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It
seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground
again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was
so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but
I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any
protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to
delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was
passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was
within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I
suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my
recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.

Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a
long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by
another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which
now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed
to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp
it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to
strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they
quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from
sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each
side of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which
affected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to
jump from the calche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged
madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them
from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to
the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able
to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and
whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers
doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became
quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again
took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This
time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a
narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.

Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the
roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning
rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we
could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the
rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.
It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,
so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The
keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew
fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer
and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I
grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver,
however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to
left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.

Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The
driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,
jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know
what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while
I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took
his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep
and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated
endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.
Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness
around us I could watch the driver's motions. He went rapidly to where
the blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem
to illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones,
formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical
effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,
for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but
as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me
straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue
flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the
wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.

At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he
had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse
than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause
for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just
then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the
jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw
around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,
with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more
terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.
For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man
feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand
their true import.

All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had
some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and
looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;
but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they
had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for
it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the
ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the
calche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as
to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know
not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and
looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his
long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves
fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across
the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.

When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calche, and the
wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a
dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time
seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete
darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on
ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main
always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the
driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a
vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,
and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit
sky.




CHAPTER II

JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL--_continued_


_5 May._--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully
awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In
the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark
ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than
it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.

When the calche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand
to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious
strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have
crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed
them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and
studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of
massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was
massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and
weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the
reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one
of the dark openings.

I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell
or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark
window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The
time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon
me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?
What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a
customary incident in the life of a solicitor's clerk sent out to
explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor's
clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor--for just before leaving
London I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a
full-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if
I were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I
expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with
the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt
in the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the
pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake
and among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to
wait the coming of the morning.

Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching
behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming
light. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of
massive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise
of long disuse, and the great door swung back.

Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white
moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck
of colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver
lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,
throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the
open door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly
gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--

"Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!" He made no
motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his
gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that
I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and
holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,
an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as
ice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:--

"Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the
happiness you bring!" The strength of the handshake was so much akin to
that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that
for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was
speaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:--

"Count Dracula?" He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--

"I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;
the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest." As he was
speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,
took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I
protested but he insisted:--

"Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not
available. Let me see to your comfort myself." He insisted on carrying
my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and
along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang
heavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced
to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,
and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,
flamed and flared.

The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing
the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit
by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing
through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a
welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with
another log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were
fresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself
left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the
door:--

"You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your
toilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come
into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared."

The light and warmth and the Count's courteous welcome seemed to have
dissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state,
I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty
toilet, I went into the other room.

I found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the
great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of
his hand to the table, and said:--

"I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse
me that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup."

I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.
He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed
it to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of
pleasure.

"I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant
sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to
come; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in
whom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy
and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is
discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall
be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take
your instructions in all matters."

The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I
fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese
and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was
my supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many
questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had
experienced.

By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host's desire had drawn
up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me,
at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an
opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked
physiognomy.

His face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the
thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and
hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His
eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy
hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I
could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather
cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over
the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a
man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops
extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm
though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.

Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees
in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing
them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather
coarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in
the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp
point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not
repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a
horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could
not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a
grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his
protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the
fireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the
window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a
strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from
down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count's eyes
gleamed, and he said:--

"Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make!"
Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he
added:--

"Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the
hunter." Then he rose and said:--

"But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you
shall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon;
so sleep well and dream well!" With a courteous bow, he opened for me
himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....

I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things,
which I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the
sake of those dear to me!

       *       *       *       *       *

_7 May._--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the
last twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my
own accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had
supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the
pot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which
was written:--

"I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.--D." I set to and
enjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I
might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.
There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the
extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service
is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.
The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of
my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have
been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,
though in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court,
but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of
the rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my
table, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I
could either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant
anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.
Some time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it
breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o'clock when I had
it--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about
the castle until I had asked the Count's permission. There was
absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing
materials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of
library. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.

In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English
books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and
newspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines
and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books
were of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political
economy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life
and customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the
London Directory, the "Red" and "Blue" books, Whitaker's Almanac, the
Army and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the
Law List.

Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count
entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good
night's rest. Then he went on:--

"I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that
will interest you. These companions"--and he laid his hand on some of
the books--"have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever
since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours
of pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to
know her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of
your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of
humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes
it what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books.
To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak."

"But, Count," I said, "you know and speak English thoroughly!" He bowed
gravely.

"I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I
fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know
the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them."

"Indeed," I said, "you speak excellently."

"Not so," he answered. "Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your
London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not
enough for me. Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me,
and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men
know him not--and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am
like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his
speaking if he hear my words, 'Ha, ha! a stranger!' I have been so long
master that I would be master still--or at least that none other should
be master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter
Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You
shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may
learn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make
error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be
away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many
important affairs in hand."

Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might
come into that room when I chose. He answered: "Yes, certainly," and
added:--

"You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are
locked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that
all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with
my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand." I said I was sure of
this, and then he went on:--

"We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are
not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from
what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of
what strange things there may be."

This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to
talk, if only for talking's sake, I asked him many questions regarding
things that had already happened to me or come within my notice.
Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by
pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most
frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked
him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for
instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue
flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a
certain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits
are supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place
where treasure has been concealed. "That treasure has been hidden," he
went on, "in the region through which you came last night, there can be
but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the
Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil
in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,
patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the
Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out
to meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited
their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep
destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader
was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been
sheltered in the friendly soil."

"But how," said I, "can it have remained so long undiscovered, when
there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?"
The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,
sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:--

"Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only
appear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he
can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he
would not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who
marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight
even for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to
find these places again?"

"There you are right," I said. "I know no more than the dead where even
to look for them." Then we drifted into other matters.

"Come," he said at last, "tell me of London and of the house which you
have procured for me." With an apology for my remissness, I went into my
own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in
order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I
passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp
lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit
in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa,
reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw's Guide. When I
came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I
went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in
everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its
surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the
subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much
more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:--

"Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there
I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me, I
fall into my country's habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend
Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be
in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my
other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!"

We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at
Purfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the
necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to
Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a
place. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I
inscribe here:--

"At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to
be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place
was for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure,
built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of
years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with
rust.

"The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _Quatre
Face_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of
the compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by
the solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which
make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or
small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and
flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all
periods back, I should say, to medival times, for one part is of stone
immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with
iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or
church. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading
to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from
various points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling
way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must
be very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very
large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic
asylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds."

When I had finished, he said:--

"I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to
live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a
day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice
also that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love
not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not
gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and
sparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young;
and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not
attuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the
shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken
battlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would
be alone with my thoughts when I may." Somehow his words and his look
did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his
smile look malignant and saturnine.

Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers
together. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of
the books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at
England, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in
certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed
that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new
estate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the
Yorkshire coast.

It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. "Aha!" he
said; "still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I
am informed that your supper is ready." He took my arm, and we went into
the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The
Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from
home. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.
After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with
me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour
after hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not
say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host's wishes in
every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified
me; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at
the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.
They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to
the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and
tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere
can well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up
with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count
Dracula, jumping to his feet, said:--

"Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so
long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of
England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by
us," and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.

I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to
notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the
warm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have
written of this day.

       *       *       *       *       *

_8 May._--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too
diffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for
there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I
cannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had
never come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on
me; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I
could bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with,
and he!--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let
me be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and
imagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say
at once how I stand--or seem to.

I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could
not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window,
and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,
and heard the Count's voice saying to me, "Good-morning." I started, for
it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass
covered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly,
but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count's
salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.
This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I
could see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in
the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no
sign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on
the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague
feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at
the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was
trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half
round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his
eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at
my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which
held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed
so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.

"Take care," he said, "take care how you cut yourself. It is more
dangerous than you think in this country." Then seizing the shaving
glass, he went on: "And this is the wretched thing that has done the
mischief. It is a foul bauble of man's vanity. Away with it!" and
opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung
out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones
of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very
annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or
the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.

When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could
not find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that
as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very
peculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I
went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The
view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity
of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A
stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without
touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree
tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and
there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through
the forests.

But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I
explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and
bolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there
an available exit.

The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!




CHAPTER III

JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL--_continued_


When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.
I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of
every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my
helplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a
few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much
as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me
that I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever done
anything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done. I
am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of
one thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to
the Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it
himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive
me if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only
plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes
open. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears,
or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and
shall need, all my brains to get through.

I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below
shut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into
the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making
the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along
thought--that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him
through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the
dining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these
menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.
This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it
must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that
brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it
mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his
hand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the
coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the
crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless
that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a
comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing
which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous
should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there
is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium,
a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some
time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my
mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count
Dracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk of
himself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful,
however, not to awake his suspicion.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Midnight._--I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few
questions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject
wonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of
battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he
afterwards explained by saying that to a _boyar_ the pride of his house
and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their
fate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said "we,"
and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could put
down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most
fascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He
grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great
white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as
though he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I
shall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of
his race:--

"We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood
of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here,
in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from
Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their
Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay,
and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the
were-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found
the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame,
till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those
old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the
desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as
Attila, whose blood is in these veins?" He held up his arms. "Is it a
wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the
Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his
thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when
Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us
here when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed
there? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were
claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries
was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more
than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say,
'water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.' Who more gladly than we
throughout the Four Nations received the 'bloody sword,' or at its
warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was
redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the
flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who
was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat
the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that
his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the
Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula,
indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and
again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who,
when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had
to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being
slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They
said that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants
without a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to
conduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Mohcs, we threw off the
Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for
our spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the
Szekelys--and the Dracula as their heart's blood, their brains, and
their swords--can boast a record that mushroom growths like the
Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over.
Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and
the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told."

It was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (_Mem._, this
diary seems horribly like the beginning of the "Arabian Nights," for
everything has to break off at cockcrow--or like the ghost of Hamlet's
father.)

       *       *       *       *       *

_12 May._--Let me begin with facts--bare, meagre facts, verified by
books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must not
confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own
observation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from
his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the
doing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over
books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the
matters I had been examined in at Lincoln's Inn. There was a certain
method in the Count's inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in
sequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.

First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I
told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be
wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only
one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate
against his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to
ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to
attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case
local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking
solicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any
chance mislead him, so he said:--

"I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under
the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from
London, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Now
here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have
sought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one
resident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be
served save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps,
have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to
seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose
I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or
Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more
ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?" I answered that
certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of
agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on
instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing
himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by
him without further trouble.

"But," said he, "I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?"

"Of course," I replied; and "such is often done by men of business, who
do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person."

"Good!" he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making
consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of
difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded
against. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,
and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a
wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or
foresee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not
evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were
wonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had
spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books
available, he suddenly stood up and said:--

"Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter
Hawkins, or to any other?" It was with some bitterness in my heart that
I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of
sending letters to anybody.

"Then write now, my young friend," he said, laying a heavy hand on my
shoulder: "write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will
please you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now."

"Do you wish me to stay so long?" I asked, for my heart grew cold at the
thought.

"I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master,
employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,
it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not
stinted. Is it not so?"

What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins's interest, not
mine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count
Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing
which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I
could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his
mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but
in his own smooth, resistless way:--

"I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things
other than business in your letters. It will doubtless please your
friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting
home to them. Is it not so?" As he spoke he handed me three sheets of
note-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign
post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,
with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood
as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for
he would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes
now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for
to her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he
did see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a
book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to
some books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them with his
own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door
had closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which
were face down on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, for
under the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way
I could.

One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The
Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to
Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth,
bankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just
about to look at them when I saw the door-handle move. I sank back in my
seat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and
to resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his
hand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and stamped
them carefully, and then turning to me, said:--

"I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this
evening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish." At the door he
turned, and after a moment's pause said:--

"Let me advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let me warn you with all
seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any
chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and has
many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be
warned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then
haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be
safe. But if you be not careful in this respect, then"--He finished his
speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were
washing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any
dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom
and mystery which seemed closing around me.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no
doubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is
not. I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed--I imagine that
my rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.

When he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing any
sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out
towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse,
inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness
of the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in
prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of
the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.
It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all
sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my
terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful
expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as
day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows
in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed
to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I
leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey
below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of
the rooms, that the windows of the Count's own room would look out. The
window at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though
weatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since
the case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked
carefully out.

What I saw was the Count's head coming out from the window. I did not
see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his
back and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had
so many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and
somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest
and amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to
repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the
window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss,
_face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At
first I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the
moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could
be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the
stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus
using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable
speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.

What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the
semblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering
me; I am in fear--in awful fear--and there is no escape for me; I am
encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....

       *       *       *       *       *

_15 May._--Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion.
He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good
deal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his head
had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without
avail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I
knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to
explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and
taking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had
expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the
stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could
pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the
door was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count's
room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and
escape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs
and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two
small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in
them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last,
however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it
seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder,
and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came
from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door
rested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have
again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that
I could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right
than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could
see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the
windows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter
side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle
was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was
quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or
bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,
impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the
west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged
mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with
mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and
crannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle
occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of
comfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the
yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to
see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over
all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My
lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was
glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place
which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better
than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the
presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I
found a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak
table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much
thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my
diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is
nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my
senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own
which mere "modernity" cannot kill.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later: the Morning of 16 May._--God preserve my sanity, for to this I
am reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.
Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not
go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely it
is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this
hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone I
can look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his
purpose. Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of that way
lies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things which
have puzzled me. Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant
when he made Hamlet say:--

    "My tablets! quick, my tablets!
    'Tis meet that I put it down," etc.,

for now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock
had come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose.
The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.

The Count's mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens
me more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon
me. I shall fear to doubt what he may say!

When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and
pen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The Count's warning came into my mind,
but I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me,
and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft
moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom
which refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to the
gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat
and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for
their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great
couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look
at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for
the dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen
asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly
real--so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the
morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.

I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I
came into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,
my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of
dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by
their dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming
when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw
no shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some
time, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline
noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be
almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was
fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes
like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it
in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the
moment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like
pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something
about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some
deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would
kiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some
day it should meet Mina's eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.
They whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such a
silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have
come through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable,
tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand.
The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her
on. One said:--

"Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to
begin." The other added:--

"He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all." I lay quiet,
looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.
The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement
of her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent
the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter
underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.

I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under
the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply
gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling
and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips
like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining
on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp
teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of
my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she
paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked
her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the
skin of my throat began to tingle as one's flesh does when the hand that
is to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer. I could feel the soft,
shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat,
and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.
I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating
heart.

But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as
lightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his
being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I
saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with
giant's power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the
white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with
passion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to
the demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light
in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His
face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires;
the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar
of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman
from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating
them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the
wolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to
cut through the air and then ring round the room he said:--

"How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when
I had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware
how you meddle with him, or you'll have to deal with me." The fair girl,
with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--

"You yourself never loved; you never love!" On this the other women
joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the
room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure
of fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,
and said in a soft whisper:--

"Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it
not so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall
kiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work
to be done."

"Are we to have nothing to-night?" said one of them, with a low laugh,
as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which
moved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he
nodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my
ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a
half-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with
horror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful
bag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me
without my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the
moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the
dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.

Then the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.




CHAPTER IV

JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL--_continued_


I awoke in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must
have carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but
could not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were
certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by
in a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I am
rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and
many such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have been
evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or
another, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one
thing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed
me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. I
am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not
have brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it. As I look round this
room, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of
sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who
were--who _are_--waiting to suck my blood.

       *       *       *       *       *

_18 May._--I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for
I _must_ know the truth. When I got to the doorway at the top of the
stairs I found it closed. It had been so forcibly driven against the
jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. I could see that the bolt
of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.
I fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.

       *       *       *       *       *

_19 May._--I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count asked me in
the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here
was nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days,
another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the
letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at
Bistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state
of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I
am so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his
suspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, and
that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to
prolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me a
chance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath
which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explained
to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would
ensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so much
impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would
be held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my
prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new
suspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked
him what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and
then said:--

"The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June
29."

I know now the span of my life. God help me!

       *       *       *       *       *

_28 May._--There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to
send word home. A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are
encamped in the courtyard. These Szgany are gipsies; I have notes of
them in my book. They are peculiar to this part of the world, though
allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are thousands
of them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law.
They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or _boyar_, and
call themselves by his name. They are fearless and without religion,
save superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the Romany
tongue.

I shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them
posted. I have already spoken them through my window to begin
acquaintanceship. They took their hats off and made obeisance and many
signs, which, however, I could not understand any more than I could
their spoken language....

       *       *       *       *       *

I have written the letters. Mina's is in shorthand, and I simply ask Mr.
Hawkins to communicate with her. To her I have explained my situation,
but without the horrors which I may only surmise. It would shock and
frighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her. Should the
letters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know my secret or the
extent of my knowledge....

       *       *       *       *       *

I have given the letters; I threw them through the bars of my window
with a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted. The
man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them
in his cap. I could do no more. I stole back to the study, and began to
read. As the Count did not come in, I have written here....

       *       *       *       *       *

The Count has come. He sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest
voice as he opened two letters:--

"The Szgany has given me these, of which, though I know not whence they
come, I shall, of course, take care. See!"--he must have looked at
it--"one is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other"--here
he caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, and
the dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly--"the
other is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It is
not signed. Well! so it cannot matter to us." And he calmly held letter
and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. Then he
went on:--

"The letter to Hawkins--that I shall, of course, send on, since it is
yours. Your letters are sacred to me. Your pardon, my friend, that
unknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?" He held
out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean
envelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. When
he went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly. A minute later
I went over and tried it, and the door was locked.

When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his
coming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was very
courteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been
sleeping, he said:--

"So, my friend, you are tired? Get to bed. There is the surest rest. I
may not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many labours
to me; but you will sleep, I pray." I passed to my room and went to bed,
and, strange to say, slept without dreaming. Despair has its own calms.

       *       *       *       *       *

_31 May._--This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself
with some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket, so
that I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again a
surprise, again a shock!

Every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda,
relating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that
might be useful to me were I once outside the castle. I sat and pondered
awhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and I made search of my
portmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had placed my clothes.

The suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and
rug; I could find no trace of them anywhere. This looked like some new
scheme of villainy....

       *       *       *       *       *

_17 June._--This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed
cudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and pounding
and scraping of horses' feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.
With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great
leiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of
each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty
sheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long staves in hand. I
ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the
main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them. Again a
shock: my door was fastened on the outside.

Then I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me
stupidly and pointed, but just then the "hetman" of the Szgany came out,
and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they
laughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised
entreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away.
The leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick
rope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks
handled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When
they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the
yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on
it for luck, lazily went each to his horse's head. Shortly afterwards, I
heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.

       *       *       *       *       *

_24 June, before morning._--Last night the Count left me early, and
locked himself into his own room. As soon as I dared I ran up the
winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. I
thought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.
The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of
some kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled sound
as of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some
ruthless villainy.

I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw
something coming out of the Count's window. I drew back and watched
carefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to
find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst
travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I
had seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest,
and in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he will
allow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave
evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own
letters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local
people be attributed to me.

It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up
here, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which
is even a criminal's right and consolation.

I thought I would watch for the Count's return, and for a long time sat
doggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were some
quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were
like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in
clusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of
soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the
embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more
fully the arial gambolling.

Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far
below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to
ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to
the sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to
awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling,
and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I
was becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the
moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom
beyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom
shapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my
senses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were
becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the
three ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat
safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp
was burning brightly.

When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the
Count's room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then
there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a
beating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and
could do nothing. I sat down and simply cried.

As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without--the agonised cry of a
woman. I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between
the bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her
hands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning
against a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face at the window she
threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:--

"Monster, give me my child!"

She threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same
words in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair and beat her
breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant
emotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see
her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.

Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the
Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to be
answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes
had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated,
through the wide entrance into the courtyard.

There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but
short. Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.

I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and
she was better dead.

What shall I do? what can I do? How can I escape from this dreadful
thing of night and gloom and fear?

       *       *       *       *       *

_25 June, morning._--No man knows till he has suffered from the night
how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be. When the
sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great
gateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me
as if the dove from the ark had lighted there. My fear fell from me as
if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. I must
take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. Last
night one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal
series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the
earth.

Let me not think of it. Action!

It has always been at night-time that I have been molested or
threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. I have not yet seen the
Count in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that
he may be awake whilst they sleep? If I could only get into his room!
But there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no way for me.

Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has gone
why may not another body go? I have seen him myself crawl from his
window. Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window? The
chances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still. I shall risk
it. At the worst it can only be death; and a man's death is not a
calf's, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me. God help me
in my task! Good-bye, Mina, if I fail; good-bye, my faithful friend and
second father; good-bye, all, and last of all Mina!

       *       *       *       *       *

_Same day, later._--I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have
come safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. I
went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south
side, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs
around the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut,
and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I
took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down
once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would
not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty
well the direction and distance of the Count's window, and made for it
as well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did
not feel dizzy--I suppose I was too excited--and the time seemed
ridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill and
trying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when
I bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked
around for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.
The room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which
seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same
style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked
for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it
anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one
corner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and
Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as
though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was
less than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments,
some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.

At one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I
could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which
was the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or
all my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone
passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended,
minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit
by loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark,
tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the
odour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell
grew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood
ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently
been used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were
steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and
the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been
brought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for
any further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of
the ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the
vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to
my very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments
of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made a
discovery.

There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a
pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asleep, I
could not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without the
glassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all
their pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of
movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him,
and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lain
there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours.
By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.
I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw
the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate,
though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and
leaving the Count's room by the window, crawled again up the castle
wall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried
to think....

       *       *       *       *       *

_29 June._--To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has
taken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the
castle by the same window, and in my clothes. As he went down the wall,
lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might
destroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man's hand would
have any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared
to see those weird sisters. I came back to the library, and read there
till I fell asleep.

I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can
look as he said:--

"To-morrow, my friend, we must part. You return to your beautiful
England, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never
meet. Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be
here, but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come the
Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some
Slovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall
bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to
Bistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle
Dracula." I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.
Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in
connection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:--

"Why may I not go to-night?"

"Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission."

"But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once." He smiled,
such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick
behind his smoothness. He said:--

"And your baggage?"

"I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time."

The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my
eyes, it seemed so real:--

"You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is
that which rules our _boyars_: 'Welcome the coming; speed the parting
guest.' Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an hour shall you wait
in my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that
you so suddenly desire it. Come!" With a stately gravity, he, with the
lamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he
stopped.

"Hark!"

Close at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the
sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great
orchestra seems to leap under the bton of the conductor. After a pause
of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back
the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it
open.

To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I
looked all round, but could see no key of any kind.

As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder
and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed
feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then that
to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With such
allies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still the door
continued slowly to open, and only the Count's body stood in the gap.
Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my
doom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There
was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and
as a last chance I cried out:--

"Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!" and covered my face with my
hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his
powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged
and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.

In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went
to my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand
to me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that
Judas in hell might be proud of.

When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a
whispering at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my ears
deceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:--

"Back, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have
patience! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!" There was a low,
sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw
without the three terrible women licking their lips. As I appeared they
all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.

I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then so near
the end? To-morrow! to-morrow! Lord, help me, and those to whom I am
dear!

       *       *       *       *       *

_30 June, morning._--These may be the last words I ever write in this
diary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself
on my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me
ready.

At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning
had come. Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe.
With a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall. I had seen
that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands
that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the
massive bolts.

But the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled, and pulled, at
the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its
casement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the
Count.

Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I
determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count's
room. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of
evils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled
down the wall, as before, into the Count's room. It was empty, but that
was as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold
remained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding
stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well
enough where to find the monster I sought.

The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid
was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their
places to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so
I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw
something which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count,
but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair
and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller,
and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than
ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the
corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep,
burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches
underneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were
simply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his
repletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in
me revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The
coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those
horrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the
key. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile
on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I
was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come
he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and
create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the
helpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me
to rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand,
but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the
cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the
hateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full
upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to
paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face,
merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my
hand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade
caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid
thing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face,
blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its
own in the nethermost hell.

I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed
on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I
waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming
closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the
cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had
spoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which
contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count's
room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.
With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the
key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must
have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of
the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and
dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to
run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance;
but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the
door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from
the lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was
hopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing
round me more closely.

As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet
and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,
with their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the
box being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again
along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.

The door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key
in the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and
shuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.

Hark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,
the crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the
distance.

I am alone in the castle with those awful women. Faugh! Mina is a woman,
and there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit!

I shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle wall
farther than I have yet attempted. I shall take some of the gold with
me, lest I want it later. I may find a way from this dreadful place.

And then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train! away
from this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his
children still walk with earthly feet!

At least God's mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the
precipice is steep and high. At its foot a man may sleep--as a man.
Good-bye, all! Mina!




CHAPTER V

_Letter from Miss Mina Murray to Miss Lucy Westenra._


"_9 May._

"My dearest Lucy,--

"Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmed
with work. The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying.
I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together
freely and build our castles in the air. I have been working very hard
lately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan's studies, and I have
been practising shorthand very assiduously. When we are married I shall
be able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I
can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for
him on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard. He
and I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a
stenographic journal of his travels abroad. When I am with you I
shall keep a diary in the same way. I don't mean one of those
two-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a
sort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do not
suppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not
intended for them. I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it
anything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall try
to do what I see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing
descriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told that, with
a little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears
said during a day. However, we shall see. I will tell you of my little
plans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan
from Transylvania. He is well, and will be returning in about a week. I
am longing to hear all his news. It must be so nice to see strange
countries. I wonder if we--I mean Jonathan and I--shall ever see them
together. There is the ten o'clock bell ringing. Good-bye.

"Your loving

"MINA.

"Tell me all the news when you write. You have not told me anything for
a long time. I hear rumours, and especially of a tall, handsome,
curly-haired man???"


_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray_.

"_17, Chatham Street_,

"_Wednesday_.

"My dearest Mina,--

"I must say you tax me _very_ unfairly with being a bad correspondent. I
wrote to you _twice_ since we parted, and your last letter was only your
_second_. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing
to interest you. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a good deal
to picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As to the
tall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at the
last Pop. Some one has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr.
Holmwood. He often comes to see us, and he and mamma get on very well
together; they have so many things to talk about in common. We met some
time ago a man that would just _do for you_, if you were not already
engaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent _parti_, being handsome, well
off, and of good birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! He
is only nine-and-twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under
his own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to
see us, and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute men
I ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I
can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has
a curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to
read one's thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter
myself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do
you ever try to read your own face? _I do_, and I can tell you it is not
a bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you
have never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious psychological
study, and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take sufficient
interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is a
bore. That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur says that every day.
There, it is all out. Mina, we have told all our secrets to each other
since we were _children_; we have slept together and eaten together, and
laughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would like
to speak more. Oh, Mina, couldn't you guess? I love him. I am blushing
as I write, for although I _think_ he loves me, he has not told me so in
words. But oh, Mina, I love him; I love him; I love him! There, that
does me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire
undressing, as we used to sit; and I would try to tell you what I feel.
I do not know how I am writing this even to you. I am afraid to stop,
or I should tear up the letter, and I don't want to stop, for I _do_ so
want to tell you all. Let me hear from you _at once_, and tell me all
that you think about it. Mina, I must stop. Good-night. Bless me in your
prayers; and, Mina, pray for my happiness.

"LUCY.

"P.S.--I need not tell you this is a secret. Good-night again.

"L."

_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray_.

"_24 May_.

"My dearest Mina,--

"Thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet letter. It was so
nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.

"My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are.
Here am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a
proposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had three.
Just fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn't it awful! I feel sorry,
really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so
happy that I don't know what to do with myself. And three proposals!
But, for goodness' sake, don't tell any of the girls, or they would be
getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured
and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at
least. Some girls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged and
are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can
despise vanity. Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keep
it a secret, dear, from _every one_, except, of course, Jonathan. You
will tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell
Arthur. A woman ought to tell her husband everything--don't you think
so, dear?--and I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives, to
be quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not always
quite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just
before lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic-asylum
man, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was very cool
outwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schooling
himself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he
almost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don't generally do
when they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept
playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to
me, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him,
though he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to
help and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I
did not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute
and would not add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if
I could love him in time; and when I shook my head his hands trembled,
and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one
else. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my
confidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman's heart was
free a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to
tell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he
stood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my
hands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever
wanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can't
help crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being
proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn't at
all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know
loves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to
know that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing
quite out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so
miserable, though I am so happy.

"_Evening._

"Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left
off, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number Two
came after lunch. He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, and
he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he
has been to so many places and has had such adventures. I sympathise
with poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her
ear, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards that
we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him. I know now
what I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I
don't, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never
told any, and yet---- My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey P.
Morris found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl
alone. No, he doesn't, for Arthur tried twice to _make_ a chance, and I
helping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell you
beforehand that Mr. Morris doesn't always speak slang--that is to say,
he never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well
educated and has exquisite manners--but he found out that it amused me
to hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there
was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid, my
dear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he
has to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself if I shall
ever speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never
heard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked
as happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he was
very nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:--

"'Miss Lucy, I know I ain't good enough to regulate the fixin's of your
little shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you
will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. Won't
you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road
together, driving in double harness?'

"Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn't seem
half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as
lightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I
wasn't broken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken in
a light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so
on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him. He
really did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn't help
feeling a bit serious too--I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid
flirt--though I couldn't help feeling a sort of exultation that he was
number two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word he
began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very
heart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall
never again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest,
because he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face
which checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of
manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free:--

"'Lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, I know. I should not be here
speaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, right
through to the very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow
to another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there is
I'll never trouble you a hair's breadth again, but will be, if you will
let me, a very faithful friend.'

"My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy
of them? Here was I almost making fun of this great-hearted, true
gentleman. I burst into tears--I am afraid, my dear, you will think
this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one--and I really felt very
badly. Why can't they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want
her, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must not say
it. I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into
Mr. Morris's brave eyes, and I told him out straight:--

"'Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he
even loves me.' I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a
light came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine--I
think I put them into his--and said in a hearty way:--

"'That's my brave girl. It's better worth being late for a chance of
winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don't
cry, my dear. If it's for me, I'm a hard nut to crack; and I take it
standing up. If that other fellow doesn't know his happiness, well, he'd
better look for it soon, or he'll have to deal with me. Little girl,
your honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that's rarer than a
lover; it's more unselfish anyhow. My dear, I'm going to have a pretty
lonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won't you give me one kiss?
It'll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. You can, you
know, if you like, for that other good fellow--he must be a good fellow,
my dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love him--hasn't spoken
yet.' That quite won me, Mina, for it _was_ brave and sweet of him, and
noble, too, to a rival--wasn't it?--and he so sad; so I leant over and
kissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down
into my face--I am afraid I was blushing very much--he said:--

"'Little girl, I hold your hand, and you've kissed me, and if these
things don't make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweet
honesty to me, and good-bye.' He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat,
went straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a
quiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby. Oh, why must a man like
that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would
worship the very ground he trod on? I know I would if I were free--only
I don't want to be free. My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I
cannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and I
don't wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy.

"Ever your loving

"LUCY.

"P.S.--Oh, about number Three--I needn't tell you of number Three, need
I? Besides, it was all so confused; it seemed only a moment from his
coming into the room till both his arms were round me, and he was
kissing me. I am very, very happy, and I don't know what I have done to
deserve it. I must only try in the future to show that I am not
ungrateful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a
lover, such a husband, and such a friend.

"Good-bye."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

(Kept in phonograph)

_25 May._--Ebb tide in appetite to-day. Cannot eat, cannot rest, so
diary instead. Since my rebuff of yesterday I have a sort of empty
feeling; nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth
the doing.... As I knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was
work, I went down amongst the patients. I picked out one who has
afforded me a study of much interest. He is so quaint that I am
determined to understand him as well as I can. To-day I seemed to get
nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery.

I questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with a view to making
myself master of the facts of his hallucination. In my manner of doing
it there was, I now see, something of cruelty. I seemed to wish to keep
him to the point of his madness--a thing which I avoid with the patients
as I would the mouth of hell.

(_Mem._, under what circumstances would I _not_ avoid the pit of hell?)
_Omnia Rom venalia sunt._ Hell has its price! _verb. sap._ If there be
anything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it afterwards
_accurately_, so I had better commence to do so, therefore--

R. M. Renfield, tat 59.--Sanguine temperament; great physical strength;
morbidly excitable; periods of gloom, ending in some fixed idea which I
cannot make out. I presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the
disturbing influence end in a mentally-accomplished finish; a possibly
dangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish. In selfish men caution
is as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves. What I think of
on this point is, when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is
balanced with the centrifugal; when duty, a cause, etc., is the fixed
point, the latter force is paramount, and only accident or a series of
accidents can balance it.


_Letter, Quincey P. Morris to Hon. Arthur Holmwood._

"_25 May._

"My dear Art,--

"We've told yarns by the camp-fire in the prairies; and dressed one
another's wounds after trying a landing at the Marquesas; and drunk
healths on the shore of Titicaca. There are more yarns to be told, and
other wounds to be healed, and another health to be drunk. Won't you let
this be at my camp-fire to-morrow night? I have no hesitation in asking
you, as I know a certain lady is engaged to a certain dinner-party, and
that you are free. There will only be one other, our old pal at the
Korea, Jack Seward. He's coming, too, and we both want to mingle our
weeps over the wine-cup, and to drink a health with all our hearts to
the happiest man in all the wide world, who has won the noblest heart
that God has made and the best worth winning. We promise you a hearty
welcome, and a loving greeting, and a health as true as your own right
hand. We shall both swear to leave you at home if you drink too deep to
a certain pair of eyes. Come!

CHAPTER VI

MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL


_24 July. Whitby._--Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and
lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in
which they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the
Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the
harbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the
view seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is
beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land
on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to
see down. The houses of the old town--the side away from us--are all
red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the
pictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby
Abbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of
"Marmion," where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble
ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is
a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and
the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big
graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in
Whitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the
harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness
stretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that
part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been
destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches
out over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside
them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long
looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and
sit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my
book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are
sitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and
talk.

The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall
stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in
the middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside
of it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely,
and its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a
narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.

It is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to
nothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between
banks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this
side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of
which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of
it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a
mournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is
lost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he
is coming this way....

He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all
gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he is
nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing
fleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical
person, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady
at the abbey he said very brusquely:--

"I wouldn't fash masel' about them, miss. Them things be all wore out.
Mind, I don't say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn't in
my time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an' the like,
but not for a nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks from York and
Leeds that be always eatin' cured herrin's an' drinkin' tea an' lookin'
out to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder masel' who'd be
bothered tellin' lies to them--even the newspapers, which is full of
fool-talk." I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting
things from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about
the whale-fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to begin
when the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said:--

"I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter doesn't like
to be kept waitin' when the tea is ready, for it takes me time to
crammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of 'em; an', miss, I lack
belly-timber sairly by the clock."

He hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down
the steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead from
the town up to the church, there are hundreds of them--I do not know how
many--and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that
a horse could easily walk up and down them. I think they must originally
have had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too. Lucy went
out visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did
not go. They will be home by this.

       *       *       *       *       *

_1 August._--I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most
interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come
and join him. He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should think
must have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admit
anything, and downfaces everybody. If he can't out-argue them he bullies
them, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucy
was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got a
beautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the old men did
not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down.
She is so sweet with old people; I think they all fell in love with her
on the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but
gave me double share instead. I got him on the subject of the legends,
and he went off at once into a sort of sermon. I must try to remember it
and put it down:--

"It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel; that's what it be, an'
nowt else. These bans an' wafts an' boh-ghosts an' barguests an' bogles
an' all anent them is only fit to set bairns an' dizzy women
a-belderin'. They be nowt but air-blebs. They, an' all grims an' signs
an' warnin's, be all invented by parsons an' illsome beuk-bodies an'
railway touters to skeer an' scunner hafflin's, an' to get folks to do
somethin' that they don't other incline to. It makes me ireful to think
o' them. Why, it's them that, not content with printin' lies on paper
an' preachin' them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin' them on the
tombstones. Look here all around you in what airt ye will; all them
steans, holdin' up their heads as well as they can out of their pride,
is acant--simply tumblin' down with the weight o' the lies wrote on
them, 'Here lies the body' or 'Sacred to the memory' wrote on all of
them, an' yet in nigh half of them there bean't no bodies at all; an'
the memories of them bean't cared a pinch of snuff about, much less
sacred. Lies all of them, nothin' but lies of one kind or another! My
gog, but it'll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when they
come tumblin' up in their death-sarks, all jouped together an' tryin' to
drag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was; some of them
trimmlin' and ditherin', with their hands that dozzened an' slippy from
lyin' in the sea that they can't even keep their grup o' them."

I could see from the old fellow's self-satisfied air and the way in
which he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was
"showing off," so I put in a word to keep him going:--

"Oh, Mr. Swales, you can't be serious. Surely these tombstones are not
all wrong?"

"Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin' where they make
out the people too good; for there be folk that do think a balm-bowl be
like the sea, if only it be their own. The whole thing be only lies. Now
look you here; you come here a stranger, an' you see this kirk-garth." I
nodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did not quite
understand his dialect. I knew it had something to do with the church.
He went on: "And you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be
happed here, snod an' snog?" I assented again. "Then that be just where
the lie comes in. Why, there be scores of these lay-beds that be toom as
old Dun's 'bacca-box on Friday night." He nudged one of his companions,
and they all laughed. "And my gog! how could they be otherwise? Look at
that one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank: read it!" I went over and
read:--

"Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of
Andres, April, 1854, t. 30." When I came back Mr. Swales went on:--

"Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murdered off the coast
of Andres! an' you consated his body lay under! Why, I could name ye a
dozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above"--he pointed
northwards--"or where the currents may have drifted them. There be the
steans around ye. Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small-print of
the lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowrey--I knew his father, lost in
the _Lively_ off Greenland in '20; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the
same seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year
later; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned
in the Gulf of Finland in '50. Do ye think that all these men will have
to make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have me antherums
aboot it! I tell ye that when they got here they'd be jommlin' an'
jostlin' one another that way that it 'ud be like a fight up on the ice
in the old days, when we'd be at one another from daylight to dark, an'
tryin' to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis." This was
evidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his
cronies joined in with gusto.

"But," I said, "surely you are not quite correct, for you start on the
assumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to
take their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment. Do you think
that will be really necessary?"

"Well, what else be they tombstones for? Answer me that, miss!"

"To please their relatives, I suppose."

"To please their relatives, you suppose!" This he said with intense
scorn. "How will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote
over them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?" He
pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab, on
which the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff. "Read the
lies on that thruff-stean," he said. The letters were upside down to me
from where I sat, but Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant over
and read:--

"Sacred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope of a
glorious resurrection, on July, 29, 1873, falling from the rocks at
Kettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly
beloved son. 'He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.'
Really, Mr. Swales, I don't see anything very funny in that!" She spoke
her comment very gravely and somewhat severely.

"Ye don't see aught funny! Ha! ha! But that's because ye don't gawm the
sorrowin' mother was a hell-cat that hated him because he was
acrewk'd--a regular lamiter he was--an' he hated her so that he
committed suicide in order that she mightn't get an insurance she put on
his life. He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that
they had for scarin' the crows with. 'Twarn't for crows then, for it
brought the clegs and the dowps to him. That's the way he fell off the
rocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I've often heard him
say masel' that he hoped he'd go to hell, for his mother was so pious
that she'd be sure to go to heaven, an' he didn't want to addle where
she was. Now isn't that stean at any rate"--he hammered it with his
stick as he spoke--"a pack of lies? and won't it make Gabriel keckle
when Geordie comes pantin' up the grees with the tombstean balanced on
his hump, and asks it to be took as evidence!"

I did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as she
said, rising up:--

"Oh, why did you tell us of this? It is my favourite seat, and I cannot
leave it; and now I find I must go on sitting over the grave of a
suicide."

"That won't harm ye, my pretty; an' it may make poor Geordie gladsome to
have so trim a lass sittin' on his lap. That won't hurt ye. Why, I've
sat here off an' on for nigh twenty years past, an' it hasn't done me
no harm. Don't ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn' lie
there either! It'll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see the
tombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as a stubble-field.
There's the clock, an' I must gang. My service to ye, ladies!" And off
he hobbled.

Lucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we
took hands as we sat; and she told me all over again about Arthur and
their coming marriage. That made me just a little heart-sick, for I
haven't heard from Jonathan for a whole month.

       *       *       *       *       *

_The same day._ I came up here alone, for I am very sad. There was no
letter for me. I hope there cannot be anything the matter with Jonathan.
The clock has just struck nine. I see the lights scattered all over the
town, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and sometimes singly;
they run right up the Esk and die away in the curve of the valley. To my
left the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next
the abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind
me, and there is a clatter of a donkey's hoofs up the paved road below.
The band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time, and further
along the quay there is a Salvation Army meeting in a back street.
Neither of the bands hears the other, but up here I hear and see them
both. I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me! I wish he
were here.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_5 June._--The case of Renfield grows more interesting the more I get to
understand the man. He has certain qualities very largely developed;
selfishness, secrecy, and purpose. I wish I could get at what is the
object of the latter. He seems to have some settled scheme of his own,
but what it is I do not yet know. His redeeming quality is a love of
animals, though, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that I
sometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His pets are of odd
sorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at present such a
quantity that I have had myself to expostulate. To my astonishment, he
did not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter in
simple seriousness. He thought for a moment, and then said: "May I have
three days? I shall clear them away." Of course, I said that would do. I
must watch him.

       *       *       *       *       *

_18 June._--He has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got several
very big fellows in a box. He keeps feeding them with his flies, and
the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although he
has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his
room.

       *       *       *       *       *

_1 July._--His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his
flies, and to-day I told him that he must get rid of them. He looked
very sad at this, so I said that he must clear out some of them, at all
events. He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same time
as before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when a
horrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room,
he caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger
and thumb, and, before I knew what he was going to do, put it in his
mouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it
was very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and
gave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one. I must
watch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep problem
in his mind, for he keeps a little note-book in which he is always
jotting down something. Whole pages of it are filled with masses of
figures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the
totals added in batches again, as though he were "focussing" some
account, as the auditors put it.

       *       *       *       *       *

_8 July._--There is a method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in
my mind is growing. It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh,
unconscious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to your
conscious brother. I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I
might notice if there were any change. Things remain as they were except
that he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one. He has
managed to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. His means
of taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. Those that
do remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings in the flies by
tempting them with his food.

       *       *       *       *       *

_19 July._--We are progressing. My friend has now a whole colony of
sparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated. When I came
in he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour--a very,
very great favour; and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog. I asked
him what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his voice and
bearing:--

"A kitten, a nice little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with,
and teach, and feed--and feed--and feed!" I was not unprepared for this
request, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and
vivacity, but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows
should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; so
I said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have a
cat than a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he answered:--

"Oh, yes, I would like a cat! I only asked for a kitten lest you should
refuse me a cat. No one would refuse me a kitten, would they?" I shook
my head, and said that at present I feared it would not be possible, but
that I would see about it. His face fell, and I could see a warning of
danger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant
killing. The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test him
with his present craving and see how it will work out; then I shall know
more.

       *       *       *       *       *

_10 p. m._--I have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner
brooding. When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and
implored me to let him have a cat; that his salvation depended upon it.
I was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereupon
he went without a word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the corner
where I had found him. I shall see him in the morning early.

       *       *       *       *       *

_20 July._--Visited Renfield very early, before the attendant went his
rounds. Found him up and humming a tune. He was spreading out his sugar,
which he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his
fly-catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace. I
looked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where they
were. He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away.
There were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of
blood. I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to me if
there were anything odd about him during the day.

       *       *       *       *       *

_11 a. m._--The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield has
been very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers. "My belief is,
doctor," he said, "that he has eaten his birds, and that he just took
and ate them raw!"

       *       *       *       *       *

_11 p. m._--I gave Renfield a strong opiate to-night, enough to make
even him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it. The thought
that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory
proved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have to
invent a new classification for him, and call him a zophagous
(life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he
can, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way. He
gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then
wanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later
steps? It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. It
might be done if there were only a sufficient cause. Men sneered at
vivisection, and yet look at its results to-day! Why not advance science
in its most difficult and vital aspect--the knowledge of the brain? Had
I even the secret of one such mind--did I hold the key to the fancy of
even one lunatic--I might advance my own branch of science to a pitch
compared with which Burdon-Sanderson's physiology or Ferrier's
brain-knowledge would be as nothing. If only there were a sufficient
cause! I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted; a good
cause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an
exceptional brain, congenitally?

How well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope. I
wonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one. He has
closed the account most accurately, and to-day begun a new record. How
many of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?

To me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope,
and that truly I began a new record. So it will be until the Great
Recorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to
profit or loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be
angry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I must only wait on
hopeless and work. Work! work!

If I only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there--a
good, unselfish cause to make me work--that would be indeed happiness.


_Mina Murray's Journal._

_26 July._--I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here; it
is like whispering to one's self and listening at the same time. And
there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it
different from writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. I
had not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned; but
yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from
him. I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed
had just been received. It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula,
and says that he is just starting for home. That is not like Jonathan;
I do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, Lucy,
although she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking in
her sleep. Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided
that I am to lock the door of our room every night. Mrs. Westenra has
got an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and
along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over
with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor dear, she is
naturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her husband, Lucy's
father, had the same habit; that he would get up in the night and dress
himself and go out, if he were not stopped. Lucy is to be married in the
autumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is
to be arranged. I sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathan
and I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try to
make both ends meet. Mr. Holmwood--he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only
son of Lord Godalming--is coming up here very shortly--as soon as he can
leave town, for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is
counting the moments till he comes. She wants to take him up to the seat
on the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby. I daresay it
is the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right when he
arrives.

       *       *       *       *       *

_27 July._--No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite uneasy about him,
though why I should I do not know; but I do wish that he would write, if
it were only a single line. Lucy walks more than ever, and each night I
am awakened by her moving about the room. Fortunately, the weather is so
hot that she cannot get cold; but still the anxiety and the perpetually
being wakened is beginning to tell on me, and I am getting nervous and
wakeful myself. Thank God, Lucy's health keeps up. Mr. Holmwood has been
suddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously
ill. Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touch
her looks; she is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks are a lovely
rose-pink. She has lost that anmic look which she had. I pray it will
all last.

       *       *       *       *       *

_3 August._--Another week gone, and no news from Jonathan, not even to
Mr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard. Oh, I do hope he is not ill. He
surely would have written. I look at that last letter of his, but
somehow it does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, and yet it is
his writing. There is no mistake of that. Lucy has not walked much in
her sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about her
which I do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watching
me. She tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room
searching for the key.

_6 August._--Another three days, and no news. This suspense is getting
dreadful. If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should
feel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last
letter. I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitable
than ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was very threatening, and
the fishermen say that we are in for a storm. I must try to watch it and
learn the weather signs. To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I write is
hidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is grey--except
the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock;
grey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the
grey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. The sea
is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar,
muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey
mist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and
there is a "brool" over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom.
Dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in
the mist, and seem "men like trees walking." The fishing-boats are
racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into
the harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is
making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that
he wants to talk....

I have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. When he sat
down beside me, he said in a very gentle way:--

"I want to say something to you, miss." I could see he was not at ease,
so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak
fully; so he said, leaving his hand in mine:--

"I'm afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked
things I've been sayin' about the dead, and such like, for weeks past;
but I didn't mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I'm gone. We
aud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don't
altogether like to think of it, and we don't want to feel scart of it;
an' that's why I've took to makin' light of it, so that I'd cheer up my
own heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain't afraid of dyin', not a
bit; only I don't want to die if I can help it. My time must be nigh at
hand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man to
expect; and I'm so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin' his
scythe. Ye see, I can't get out o' the habit of caffin' about it all at
once; the chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day soon the Angel of
Death will sound his trumpet for me. But don't ye dooal an' greet, my
deary!"--for he saw that I was crying--"if he should come this very
night I'd not refuse to answer his call. For life be, after all, only a
waitin' for somethin' else than what we're doin'; and death be all that
we can rightly depend on. But I'm content, for it's comin' to me, my
deary, and comin' quick. It may be comin' while we be lookin' and
wonderin'. Maybe it's in that wind out over the sea that's bringin' with
it loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. Look! look!" he
cried suddenly. "There's something in that wind and in the hoast beyont
that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It's in the
air; I feel it comin'. Lord, make me answer cheerful when my call
comes!" He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouth
moved as though he were praying. After a few minutes' silence, he got
up, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good-bye, and hobbled
off. It all touched me, and upset me very much.

I was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy-glass under his
arm. He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time
kept looking at a strange ship.

"I can't make her out," he said; "she's a Russian, by the look of her;
but she's knocking about in the queerest way. She doesn't know her mind
a bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can't decide whether to
run up north in the open, or to put in here. Look there again! She is
steered mighty strangely, for she doesn't mind the hand on the wheel;
changes about with every puff of wind. We'll hear more of her before
this time to-morrow."




CHAPTER VII

CUTTING FROM "THE DAILYGRAPH," 8 AUGUST


(_Pasted in Mina Murray's Journal._)

From a Correspondent.

_Whitby_.

One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been
experienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had
been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of
August. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great
body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods,
Robin Hood's Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in
the neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers _Emma_ and _Scarborough_ made
trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of
"tripping" both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the
afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff
churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of
sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of
"mares'-tails" high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then
blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical
language is ranked "No. 2: light breeze." The coastguard on duty at once
made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has
kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic
manner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very
beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that
there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old
churchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black
mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its
downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour--flame,
purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and
there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all
sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The
experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the
sketches of the "Prelude to the Great Storm" will grace the R. A. and R.
I. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and
there that his "cobble" or his "mule," as they term the different
classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.
The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there
was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on
the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There
were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers,
which usually "hug" the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but
few fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign
schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The
foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for
comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal
her to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she
was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating
swell of the sea,

    "As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean."

Shortly before ten o'clock the stillness of the air grew quite
oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep
inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the
band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the
great harmony of nature's silence. A little after midnight came a
strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to
carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.

Then without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the
time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize,
the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in
growing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes
the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.
White-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the
shelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept
the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier
of Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such
force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet,
or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary
to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the
fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to
the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came
drifting inland--white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion,
so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of
imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were
touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many
a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist
cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the
lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals
of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock
of the footsteps of the storm.

Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of
absorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with
each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to
snatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with
a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again
the white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the East
Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been
tried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in
the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.
Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat,
with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance
of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the
piers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of
joy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed
to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.

Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner
with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed
earlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east,
and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they
realized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the
port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time
to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,
it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the
harbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so
great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost
visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such
speed that, in the words of one old salt, "she must fetch up somewhere,
if it was only in hell." Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than
any hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things
like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing,
for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the
booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder
than before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour
mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited
breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant
of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between
the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,
swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and
gained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a
shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a
corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each
motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great
awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had
found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However,
all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The
schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on
that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many
storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East
Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.

There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on
the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the
"top-hammer" came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant
the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as
if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow
on the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard
hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat
tombstones--"thruff-steans" or "through-stones," as they call them in
the Whitby vernacular--actually project over where the sustaining cliff
has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed
intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.

It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as
all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were
out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern
side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the
first to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring
the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the
light on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and
when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at
once as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general
curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way
round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your
correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.
When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd,
whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the
courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted
to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman
whilst actually lashed to the wheel.

It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for
not often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened
by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between
the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it
was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by
the binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but
the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of
the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he
was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the
state of things, and a doctor--Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot
Place--who came immediately after me, declared, after making
examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his
pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of
paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said
the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his
teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some
complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot
claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a
derelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young
law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already
completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the
statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of
delegated possession, is held in a _dead hand_. It is needless to say
that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where
he held his honourable watch and ward till death--a steadfastness as
noble as that of the young Casabianca--and placed in the mortuary to
await inquest.

Already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating;
crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over
the Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue, further
details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into
harbour in the storm.

_Whitby_

_9 August._--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the
storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It
turns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the
_Demeter_. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a
small amount of cargo--a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.
This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington, of
7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took
possession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too,
acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and
paid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except
the strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been
most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with
existing regulations. As the matter is to be a "nine days' wonder," they
are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after
complaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which
landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the
S. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the
animal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found;
it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it
was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still
hiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a
possibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it
is evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred
mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found
dead in the roadway opposite to its master's yard. It had been fighting,
and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away,
and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been
permitted to look over the log-book of the _Demeter_, which was in order
up to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest
except as to facts of missing men. The greatest interest, however, is
with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced
at the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between them
unfold it has not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive for
concealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a
rescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and
supercargo. It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with
some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that
this had developed persistently throughout the voyage. Of course my
statement must be taken _cum grano_, since I am writing from the

                         LOG OF THE "DEMETER."


_Varna to Whitby._

_Written 18 July, things so strange happening, that I shall keep
accurate note henceforth till we land._

       *       *       *       *       *

On 6 July we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes of earth.
At noon set sail. East wind, fresh. Crew, five hands ... two mates,
cook, and myself (captain).

       *       *       *       *       *

On 11 July at dawn entered Bosphorus. Boarded by Turkish Customs
officers. Backsheesh. All correct. Under way at 4 p. m.

       *       *       *       *       *

On 12 July through Dardanelles. More Customs officers and flagboat of
guarding squadron. Backsheesh again. Work of officers thorough, but
quick. Want us off soon. At dark passed into Archipelago.

       *       *       *       *       *

On 13 July passed Cape Matapan. Crew dissatisfied about something.
Seemed scared, but would not speak out.

       *       *       *       *       *

On 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew. Men all steady fellows, who
sailed with me before. Mate could not make out what was wrong; they only
told him there was _something_, and crossed themselves. Mate lost temper
with one of them that day and struck him. Expected fierce quarrel, but
all was quiet.

       *       *       *       *       *

On 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of crew, Petrofsky, was
missing. Could not account for it. Took larboard watch eight bells last
night; was relieved by Abramoff, but did not go to bunk. Men more
downcast than ever. All said they expected something of the kind, but
would not say more than there was _something_ aboard. Mate getting very
impatient with them; feared some trouble ahead.

       *       *       *       *       *

On 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin, and in
an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange man
aboard the ship. He said that in his watch he had been sheltering
behind the deck-house, as there was a rain-storm, when he saw a tall,
thin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companion-way,
and go along the deck forward, and disappear. He followed cautiously,
but when he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were all closed.
He was in a panic of superstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic may
spread. To allay it, I shall to-day search entire ship carefully from
stem to stern.

       *       *       *       *       *

Later in the day I got together the whole crew, and told them, as they
evidently thought there was some one in the ship, we would search from
stem to stern. First mate angry; said it was folly, and to yield to such
foolish ideas would demoralise the men; said he would engage to keep
them out of trouble with a handspike. I let him take the helm, while the
rest began thorough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns: we left
no corner unsearched. As there were only the big wooden boxes, there
were no odd corners where a man could hide. Men much relieved when
search over, and went back to work cheerfully. First mate scowled, but
said nothing.

       *       *       *       *       *

_22 July_.--Rough weather last three days, and all hands busy with
sails--no time to be frightened. Men seem to have forgotten their dread.
Mate cheerful again, and all on good terms. Praised men for work in bad
weather. Passed Gibralter and out through Straits. All well.

       *       *       *       *       *

_24 July_.--There seems some doom over this ship. Already a hand short,
and entering on the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead, and yet last
night another man lost--disappeared. Like the first, he came off his
watch and was not seen again. Men all in a panic of fear; sent a round
robin, asking to have double watch, as they fear to be alone. Mate
angry. Fear there will be some trouble, as either he or the men will do
some violence.

       *       *       *       *       *

_28 July_.--Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of maelstrom,
and the wind a tempest. No sleep for any one. Men all worn out. Hardly
know how to set a watch, since no one fit to go on. Second mate
volunteered to steer and watch, and let men snatch a few hours' sleep.
Wind abating; seas still terrific, but feel them less, as ship is
steadier.

       *       *       *       *       *

_29 July_.--Another tragedy. Had single watch to-night, as crew too
tired to double. When morning watch came on deck could find no one
except steersman. Raised outcry, and all came on deck. Thorough search,
but no one found. Are now without second mate, and crew in a panic. Mate
and I agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause.

       *       *       *       *       *

_30 July_.--Last night. Rejoiced we are nearing England. Weather fine,
all sails set. Retired worn out; slept soundly; awaked by mate telling
me that both man of watch and steersman missing. Only self and mate and
two hands left to work ship.

       *       *       *       *       *

_1 August_.--Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted. Had hoped when in
the English Channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere.
Not having power to work sails, have to run before wind. Dare not lower,
as could not raise them again. We seem to be drifting to some terrible
doom. Mate now more demoralised than either of men. His stronger nature
seems to have worked inwardly against himself. Men are beyond fear,
working stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to worst. They are
Russian, he Roumanian.

       *       *       *       *       *

_2 August, midnight_.--Woke up from few minutes' sleep by hearing a cry,
seemingly outside my port. Could see nothing in fog. Rushed on deck, and
ran against mate. Tells me heard cry and ran, but no sign of man on
watch. One more gone. Lord, help us! Mate says we must be past Straits
of Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland, just as
he heard the man cry out. If so we are now off in the North Sea, and
only God can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us; and God
seems to have deserted us.

       *       *       *       *       *

_3 August_.--At midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel, and
when I got to it found no one there. The wind was steady, and as we ran
before it there was no yawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted for the
mate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He
looked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given
way. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my
ear, as though fearing the very air might hear: "_It_ is here; I know
it, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin,
and ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind
It, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the
air." And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into
space. Then he went on: "But It is here, and I'll find It. It is in the
hold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I'll unscrew them one by one and
see. You work the helm." And, with a warning look and his finger on his
lip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could
not leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest
and a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark,
raving mad, and it's no use my trying to stop him. He can't hurt those
big boxes: they are invoiced as "clay," and to pull them about is as
harmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and
write these notes. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears.
Then, if I can't steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut
down sails and lie by, and signal for help....

       *       *       *       *       *

It is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate
would come out calmer--for I heard him knocking away at something in the
hold, and work is good for him--there came up the hatchway a sudden,
startled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he
came as if shot from a gun--a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and
his face convulsed with fear. "Save me! save me!" he cried, and then
looked round on the blanket of fog. His horror turned to despair, and in
a steady voice he said: "You had better come too, captain, before it is
too late. _He_ is there. I know the secret now. The sea will save me
from Him, and it is all that is left!" Before I could say a word, or
move forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately
threw himself into the sea. I suppose I know the secret too, now. It was
this madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has
followed them himself. God help me! How am I to account for all these
horrors when I get to port? _When_ I get to port! Will that ever be?

       *       *       *       *       *

_4 August._--Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce. I know there is
sunrise because I am a sailor, why else I know not. I dared not go
below, I dared not leave the helm; so here all night I stayed, and in
the dimness of the night I saw It--Him! God forgive me, but the mate was
right to jump overboard. It was better to die like a man; to die like a
sailor in blue water no man can object. But I am captain, and I must not
leave my ship. But I shall baffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tie
my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with
them I shall tie that which He--It!--dare not touch; and then, come good
wind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my honour as a captain. I am
growing weaker, and the night is coming on. If He can look me in the
face again, I may not have time to act.... If we are wrecked, mayhap
this bottle may be found, and those who find it may understand; if not,
... well, then all men shall know that I have been true to my trust. God
and the Blessed Virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying
to do his duty....

       *       *       *       *       *

Of course the verdict was an open one. There is no evidence to adduce;
and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now
none to say. The folk here hold almost universally that the captain is
simply a hero, and he is to be given a public funeral. Already it is
arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the Esk
for a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey
steps; for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff. The owners
of more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as
wishing to follow him to the grave.

No trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is much
mourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he would, I
believe, be adopted by the town. To-morrow will see the funeral; and so
will end this one more "mystery of the sea."


_Mina Murray's Journal._

_8 August._--Lucy was very restless all night, and I, too, could not
sleep. The storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the
chimney-pots, it made me shudder. When a sharp puff came it seemed to be
like a distant gun. Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake; but she got up
twice and dressed herself. Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and
managed to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed. It
is a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as her will is
thwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any,
disappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her
life.

Early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see
if anything had happened in the night. There were very few people about,
and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big,
grim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that
topped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the narrow mouth
of the harbour--like a bullying man going through a crowd. Somehow I
felt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night, but on land. But,
oh, is he on land or sea? Where is he, and how? I am getting fearfully
anxious about him. If I only knew what to do, and could do anything!

       *       *       *       *       *

_10 August._--The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most
touching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin
was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the
churchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst
the cortge of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down
again. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.
The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on
it when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset.
She was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that
her dreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in one thing:
she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if
there be, she does not understand it herself. There is an additional
cause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our
seat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said,
fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of
fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor
dear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so
sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other
people do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did
not much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men
who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog.
The dog is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw
the man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would
not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few
yards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and then
harshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a
noise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs
bristling out like a cat's tail when puss is on the war-path. Finally
the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then
took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on
the tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the
stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It did
not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was
in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect,
to comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to
touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. I greatly
fear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world
without trouble. She will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure. The
whole agglomeration of things--the ship steered into port by a dead
man; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the
touching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror--will all
afford material for her dreams.

I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I
shall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood's Bay and
back. She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.




CHAPTER VIII

MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL


_Same day, 11 o'clock p. m._--Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that I
had made my diary a duty I should not open it to-night. We had a lovely
walk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some
dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse,
and frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything
except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean
and give us a fresh start. We had a capital "severe tea" at Robin Hood's
Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over
the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have
shocked the "New Woman" with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless
them! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest,
and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was
really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could.
The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay
for supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I
know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that
some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new
class of curates, who don't take supper, no matter how they may be
pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep and
breathing softly. She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and
looks, oh, so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her
only in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now.
Some of the "New Women" writers will some day start an idea that men and
women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or
accepting. But I suppose the New Woman won't condescend in future to
accept; she will do the proposing herself. And a nice job she will make
of it, too! There's some consolation in that. I am so happy to-night,
because dear Lucy seems better. I really believe she has turned the
corner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming. I should be
quite happy if I only knew if Jonathan.... God bless and keep him.

       *       *       *       *       *

_11 August, 3 a. m._--Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well write.
I am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an adventure, such an
agonising experience. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary....
Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear
upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark,
so I could not see Lucy's bed; I stole across and felt for her. The bed
was empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room. The
door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake her
mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some
clothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the room it
struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her
dreaming intention. Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside.
Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places. "Thank God," I said
to myself, "she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress." I ran
downstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in
all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear
chilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It
was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people
of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that
Lucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what
might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a
big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in the
Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the North
Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At
the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to
the East Cliff, in the hope or fear--I don't know which--of seeing Lucy
in our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black,
driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of
light and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could see
nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary's Church and all
around it. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey
coming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as
a sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually
visible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for
there, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a
half-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too
quick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost
immediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind
the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was,
whether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another
glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the
fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East
Cliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced
that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy's condition. The
time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath
came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have
gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with
lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost
to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now
close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. There
was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the
half-reclining white figure. I called in fright, "Lucy! Lucy!" and
something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face
and red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the
entrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and
the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came in
view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly
that I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back
of the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living
thing about.

When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips
were parted, and she was breathing--not softly as usual with her, but in
long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every
breath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the
collar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so
there came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I
flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck,
for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air,
unclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to
have my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her
throat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety
and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing
became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I
had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began
very gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually she
became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing
occasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other
reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly,
till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised
to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.
Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must
have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking
unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She
trembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with
me home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we
passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She
stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not.
However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there
was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with
mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no
one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.

Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw
a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of
us; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as
there are here, steep little closes, or "wynds," as they call them in
Scotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I
should faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her
health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation
in case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our
feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into
bed. Before falling asleep she asked--even implored--me not to say a
word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. I
hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her
mother's health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her,
and thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted--nay,
infallibly would--in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do
so. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to
my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping
soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....

       *       *       *       *       *

_Same day, noon._--All goes well. Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed
not to have even changed her side. The adventure of the night does not
seem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she
looks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to
notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her. Indeed, it might
have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. I must have
pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are
two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress
was a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about it, she
laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. Fortunately it
cannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Same day, night._--We passed a happy day. The air was clear, and the
sun bright, and there was a cool breeze. We took our lunch to Mulgrave
Woods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the
cliff-path and joining her at the gate. I felt a little sad myself, for
I could not but feel how _absolutely_ happy it would have been had
Jonathan been with me. But there! I must only be patient. In the evening
we strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr
and Mackenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy seems more restful than she
has been for some time, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock the door
and secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect any
trouble to-night.

       *       *       *       *       *

_12 August._--My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I
was wakened by Lucy trying to get out. She seemed, even in her sleep, to
be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed
under a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds
chirping outside of the window. Lucy woke, too, and, I was glad to see,
was even better than on the previous morning. All her old gaiety of
manner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me
and told me all about Arthur. I told her how anxious I was about
Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. Well, she succeeded
somewhat, for, though sympathy can't alter facts, it can help to make
them more bearable.

       *       *       *       *       *

_13 August._--Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as
before. Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed,
still asleep, pointing to the window. I got up quietly, and pulling
aside the blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft
effect of the light over the sea and sky--merged together in one great,
silent mystery--was beautiful beyond words. Between me and the moonlight
flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once or
twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me,
and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. When I came back
from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.
She did not stir again all night.

       *       *       *       *       *

_14 August._--On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day. Lucy seems
to have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to
get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or
dinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for
dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and
stopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low
down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was
thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe
everything in a beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, and
suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:--

"His red eyes again! They are just the same." It was such an odd
expression, coming _apropos_ of nothing, that it quite startled me. I
slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare
at her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on
her face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but
followed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat,
whereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself,
for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like
burning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red
sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary's Church behind our
seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the
refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. I
called Lucy's attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself
with a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she
was thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it; so I
said nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and went
early to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself;
I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet
sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home--it was then
bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the
Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen--I threw a glance
up at our window, and saw Lucy's head leaning out. I thought that
perhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and
waved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then,
the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell
on the window. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against
the side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and
by her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a
good-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs,
but as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast
asleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat,
as though to protect it from cold.

I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that the
door is locked and the window securely fastened.

She looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, and
there is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like. I
fear she is fretting about something. I wish I could find out what it
is.

       *       *       *       *       *

_15 August._--Rose later than usual. Lucy was languid and tired, and
slept on after we had been called. We had a happy surprise at breakfast.
Arthur's father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon. Lucy
is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once. Later on
in the day she told me the cause. She is grieved to lose Lucy as her
very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to
protect her. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to me that she has got
her death-warrant. She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy;
her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for
her heart is weakening. At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be
almost sure to kill her. Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of
the dreadful night of Lucy's sleep-walking.

       *       *       *       *       *

_17 August._--No diary for two whole days. I have not had the heart to
write. Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness.
No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her
mother's hours are numbering to a close. I do not understand Lucy's
fading away as she is doing. She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys
the fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and
she gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night I hear her gasping
as if for air. I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at
night, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open
window. Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I
tried to wake her I could not; she was in a faint. When I managed to
restore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long,
painful struggles for breath. When I asked her how she came to be at the
window she shook her head and turned away. I trust her feeling ill may
not be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin. I looked at her throat
just now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.
They are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the
edges of them are faintly white. They are like little white dots with
red centres. Unless they heal within a day or two, I shall insist on the
doctor seeing about them.

_Mina Murray's Journal._

_18 August._--I am happy to-day, and write sitting on the seat in the
churchyard. Lucy is ever so much better. Last night she slept well all
night, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back already
to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she
were in any way anmic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in
gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence
seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I
needed any reminding, of _that_ night, and that it was here, on this
very seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with
the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:--

"My poor little feet didn't make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr.
Swales would have told me that it was because I didn't want to wake up
Geordie." As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she
had dreamed at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet, puckered
look came into her forehead, which Arthur--I call him Arthur from her
habit--says he loves; and, indeed, I don't wonder that he does. Then she
went on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to
herself:--

"I didn't quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to be
here in this spot--I don't know why, for I was afraid of something--I
don't know what. I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing
through the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, and
I leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling--the
whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once--as
I went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory of something long and
dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very
sweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking
into deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have
heard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away
from me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air.
I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me,
and then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in an
earthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body. I saw you do
it before I felt you."

Then she began to laugh. It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I
listened to her breathlessly. I did not quite like it, and thought it
better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to other
subjects, and Lucy was like her old self again. When we got home the
fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more
rosy. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very
happy evening together.

       *       *       *       *       *

_19 August._--Joy, joy, joy! although not all joy. At last, news of
Jonathan. The dear fellow has been ill; that is why he did not write. I
am not afraid to think it or say it, now that I know. Mr. Hawkins sent
me on the letter, and wrote himself, oh, so kindly. I am to leave in the
morning and go over to Jonathan, and to help to nurse him if necessary,
and to bring him home. Mr. Hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if
we were to be married out there. I have cried over the good Sister's
letter till I can feel it wet against my bosom, where it lies. It is of
Jonathan, and must be next my heart, for he is _in_ my heart. My journey
is all mapped out, and my luggage ready. I am only taking one change of
dress; Lucy will bring my trunk to London and keep it till I send for
it, for it may be that ... I must write no more; I must keep it to say
to Jonathan, my husband. The letter that he has seen and touched must
comfort me till we meet.


_Letter, Sister Agatha, Hospital of St. Joseph and Ste. Mary,
Buda-Pesth, to Miss Wilhelmina Murray._

"_12 August._

"Dear Madam,--

"I write by desire of Mr. Jonathan Harker, who is himself not strong
enough to write, though progressing well, thanks to God and St. Joseph
and Ste. Mary. He has been under our care for nearly six weeks,
suffering from a violent brain fever. He wishes me to convey his love,
and to say that by this post I write for him to Mr. Peter Hawkins,
Exeter, to say, with his dutiful respects, that he is sorry for his
delay, and that all of his work is completed. He will require some few
weeks' rest in our sanatorium in the hills, but will then return. He
wishes me to say that he has not sufficient money with him, and that he
would like to pay for his staying here, so that others who need shall
not be wanting for help.

"Believe me,

"Yours, with sympathy and all blessings,

"SISTER AGATHA.

"P. S.--My patient being asleep, I open this to let you know something
more. He has told me all about you, and that you are shortly to be his
wife. All blessings to you both! He has had some fearful shock--so says
our doctor--and in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful; of
wolves and poison and blood; of ghosts and demons; and I fear to say of
what. Be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite him
of this kind for a long time to come; the traces of such an illness as
his do not lightly die away. We should have written long ago, but we
knew nothing of his friends, and there was on him nothing that any one
could understand. He came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guard
was told by the station-master there that he rushed into the station
shouting for a ticket for home. Seeing from his violent demeanour that
he was English, they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the
way thither that the train reached.

"Be assured that he is well cared for. He has won all hearts by his
sweetness and gentleness. He is truly getting on well, and I have no
doubt will in a few weeks be all himself. But be careful of him for
safety's sake. There are, I pray God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary, many,
many, happy years for you both."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_19 August._--Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night. About
eight o'clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when
setting. The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest
in him, encouraged him to talk. He is usually respectful to the
attendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, he was
quite haughty. Would not condescend to talk with him at all. All he
would say was:--

     "I don't want to talk to you: you don't count now; the Master is at
     hand."

The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has
seized him. If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man with
homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. The
combination is a dreadful one. At nine o'clock I visited him myself. His
attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublime
self-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him
as nothing. It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that
he himself is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man
are too paltry for an Omnipotent Being. How these madmen give themselves
away! The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God created
from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow. Oh,
if men only knew!

For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and
greater degree. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict
observation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into his
eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it
the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to
know so well. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his
bed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes. I thought I
would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to
lead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed to excite
his attention. At first he made no reply, but at length said testily:--

"Bother them all! I don't care a pin about them."

"What?" I said. "You don't mean to tell me you don't care about
spiders?" (Spiders at present are his hobby and the note-book is filling
up with columns of small figures.) To this he answered enigmatically:--

"The bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride;
but when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes
that are filled."

He would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bed
all the time I remained with him.

I am weary to-night and low in spirits. I cannot but think of Lucy, and
how different things might have been. If I don't sleep at once, chloral,
the modern Morpheus--C_{2}HCl_{3}O. H_{2}O! I must be careful not to let
it grow into a habit. No, I shall take none to-night! I have thought of
Lucy, and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two. If need be,
to-night shall be sleepless....

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Glad I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it. I had
lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the
night-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield
had escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is
too dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his might
work out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me.
He said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his
bed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door. His
attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. He
ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once
sent up for me. He was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off.
The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should
go than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out
of the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn't get through
the window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost,
and, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt. The
attendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a
straight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got through the belt
of trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our
grounds from those of the deserted house.

I ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men
immediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our friend
might be dangerous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall,
dropped down on the other side. I could see Renfield's figure just
disappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him. On the
far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old
ironbound oak door of the chapel. He was talking, apparently to some
one, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest
I might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of
bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping
is upon him! After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not
take note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to
him--the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him
in. I heard him say:--

"I am here to do Your bidding, Master. I am Your slave, and You will
reward me, for I shall be faithful. I have worshipped You long and afar
off. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not pass
me by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things?"

He _is_ a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the loaves and fishes
even when he believes he is in a Real Presence. His manias make a
startling combination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger.
He is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man. I
never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope I
shall not again. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and
his danger in good time. With strength and determination like his, he
might have done wild work before he was caged. He is safe now at any
rate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn't get free from the strait-waistcoat
that keeps him restrained, and he's chained to the wall in the padded
room. His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are
more deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.

Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time:--

"I shall be patient, Master. It is coming--coming--coming!"

So I took the hint, and came too. I was too excited to sleep, but this
diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep to-night.




CHAPTER IX


_Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra._

"_Buda-Pesth, 24 August._

"My dearest Lucy,--

"I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we
parted at the railway station at Whitby. Well, my dear, I got to Hull
all right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here. I
feel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I
knew I was coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do some
nursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear one,
oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All the resolution has gone out
of his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his
face has vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not
remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past. At
least, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. He has had some
terrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try
to recall it. Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse,
tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head. I
wanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself,
and say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the
secrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear
them, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good soul, and the
next day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again,
and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved
about, added: 'I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about
anything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be,
have no cause to be concerned. He has not forgotten you or what he owes
to you. His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can
treat of.' I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my
poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. The idea of
_my_ being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I
felt a thrill of joy through me when I _knew_ that no other woman was a
cause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his
face while he sleeps. He is waking!...

"When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something
from the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things.
I saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to
let me look at it--for I knew then that I might find some clue to his
trouble--but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent
me over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment.
Then he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over the
note-book, and he said to me very solemnly:--

"'Wilhelmina'--I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has
never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him--'you know,
dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be no
secret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try to
think of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it
was all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brain
fever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want to
know it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.' For, my
dear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are
complete. 'Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? Here is
the book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me
know; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to
the bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.' He fell
back exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. I
have asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this
afternoon, and am waiting her reply....

       *       *       *       *       *

"She has come and told me that the chaplain of the English mission
church has been sent for. We are to be married in an hour, or as soon
after as Jonathan awakes....

       *       *       *       *       *

"Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very, very
happy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and he
sat up in bed, propped up with pillows. He answered his 'I will' firmly
and strongly. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even those
words seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were so kind. Please God, I
shall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities
I have taken upon me. I must tell you of my wedding present. When the
chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband--oh, Lucy, it
is the first time I have written the words 'my husband'--left me alone
with my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it
up in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon
which was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax,
and for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed it
to my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it would
be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each
other; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake
or for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh,
Lucy, it was the first time he took _his wife's_ hand, and said that it
was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go
through all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant to
have said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I
shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the
year.

"Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was the
happiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him
except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love
and duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me,
and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn
pledge between us....

"Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only because
it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to
me. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from
the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now,
and with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so that
in your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My dear,
please Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day of
sunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I must
not wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you will be
_always_ as happy as I am _now_. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post this at
once, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop, for Jonathan
is waking--I must attend to my husband!

"Your ever-loving

"MINA HARKER."


_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Harker._

"_Whitby, 30 August._

"My dearest Mina,--

"Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your own
home with your husband. I wish you could be coming home soon enough to
stay with us here. The strong air would soon restore Jonathan; it has
quite restored me. I have an appetite like a cormorant, am full of
life, and sleep well. You will be glad to know that I have quite given
up walking in my sleep. I think I have not stirred out of my bed for a
week, that is when I once got into it at night. Arthur says I am getting
fat. By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here. We have such
walks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing
together; and I love him more than ever. He _tells_ me that he loves me
more, but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he couldn't love me
more than he did then. But this is nonsense. There he is, calling to me.
So no more just at present from your loving

"LUCY.

"P. S.--Mother sends her love. She seems better, poor dear. "P. P.
S.--We are to be married on 28 September."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_20 August._--The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. He has
now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion.
For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then one
night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to
himself: "Now I can wait; now I can wait." The attendant came to tell
me, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was still in the
strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone
from his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading--I might
almost say, "cringing"--softness. I was satisfied with his present
condition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated,
but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange
thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for,
coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking
furtively at them:--

"They think I could hurt you! Fancy _me_ hurting _you_! The fools!"

It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated
even in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same I
do not follow his thought. Am I to take it that I have anything in
common with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has
he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being is needful
to him? I must find out later on. To-night he will not speak. Even the
offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him. He will
only say: "I don't take any stock in cats. I have more to think of now,
and I can wait; I can wait."

After a while I left him. The attendant tells me that he was quiet
until just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at
length violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted
him so that he swooned into a sort of coma.

       *       *       *       *       *

... Three nights has the same thing happened--violent all day then quiet
from moonrise to sunrise. I wish I could get some clue to the cause. It
would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went.
Happy thought! We shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones. He
escaped before without our help; to-night he shall escape with it. We
shall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow in case they
are required....

       *       *       *       *       *

_23 August._--"The unexpected always happens." How well Disraeli knew
life. Our bird when he found the cage open would not fly, so all our
subtle arrangements were for nought. At any rate, we have proved one
thing; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time. We shall in
future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day. I have given
orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room,
when once he is quiet, until an hour before sunrise. The poor soul's
body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it. Hark!
The unexpected again! I am called; the patient has once more escaped.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Another night adventure. Renfield artfully waited until the
attendant was entering the room to inspect. Then he dashed out past him
and flew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to follow.
Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him
in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw me
he became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he
would have tried to kill me. As we were holding him a strange thing
happened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew
calm. I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I caught
the patient's eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it looked
into the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its silent and
ghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this one
seemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had
some intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every instant, and
presently said:--

"You needn't tie me; I shall go quietly!" Without trouble we came back
to the house. I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shall
not forget this night....


_Lucy Westenra's Diary_

_Hillingham, 24 August._--I must imitate Mina, and keep writing things
down. Then we can have long talks when we do meet. I wonder when it will
be. I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy. Last night I
seemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby. Perhaps it is the
change of air, or getting home again. It is all dark and horrid to me,
for I can remember nothing; but I am full of vague fear, and I feel so
weak and worn out. When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved
when he saw me, and I hadn't the spirit to try to be cheerful. I wonder
if I could sleep in mother's room to-night. I shall make an excuse and
try.

       *       *       *       *       *

_25 August._--Another bad night. Mother did not seem to take to my
proposal. She seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears to
worry me. I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while; but when the
clock struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been falling
asleep. There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but I
did not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must then have
fallen asleep. More bad dreams. I wish I could remember them. This
morning I am horribly weak. My face is ghastly pale, and my throat pains
me. It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I don't seem ever to
get air enough. I shall try to cheer up when Arthur comes, or else I
know he will be miserable to see me so.


_Letter, Arthur Holmwood to Dr. Seward._

"_Albemarle Hotel, 31 August._

"My dear Jack,--

"I want you to do me a favour. Lucy is ill; that is, she has no special
disease, but she looks awful, and is getting worse every day. I have
asked her if there is any cause; I do not dare to ask her mother, for to
disturb the poor lady's mind about her daughter in her present state of
health would be fatal. Mrs. Westenra has confided to me that her doom is
spoken--disease of the heart--though poor Lucy does not know it yet. I
am sure that there is something preying on my dear girl's mind. I am
almost distracted when I think of her; to look at her gives me a pang. I
told her I should ask you to see her, and though she demurred at
first--I know why, old fellow--she finally consented. It will be a
painful task for you, I know, old friend, but it is for _her_ sake, and
I must not hesitate to ask, or you to act. You are to come to lunch at
Hillingham to-morrow, two o'clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion in
Mrs. Westenra, and after lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of being
alone with you. I shall come in for tea, and we can go away together; I
am filled with anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as I
can after you have seen her. Do not fail!

"ARTHUR."


_Telegram, Arthur Holmwood to Seward._

"_1 September._

"Am summoned to see my father, who is worse. Am writing. Write me fully
by to-night's post to Ring. Wire me if necessary."


_Letter from Dr. Seward to Arthur Holmwood._

"_2 September._

"My dear old fellow,--

"With regard to Miss Westenra's health I hasten to let you know at once
that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady
that I know of. At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with
her appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I saw
her last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full
opportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendship
makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can
bridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you to
draw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then say what I have
done and propose doing.

"I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present,
and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew
to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no
doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.
We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we
got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness
amongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with
me. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,
for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed,
however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair
with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her
high spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to
make a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:--

"'I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.' I reminded her
that a doctor's confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously
anxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that
matter in a word. 'Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care for
myself, but all for him!' So I am quite free.

"I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not see
the usual anmic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test the
quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord
gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a
slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured
a few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitative
analysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in
itself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quite
satisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a
cause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something
mental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at
times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but
regarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child she
used to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back,
and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where
Miss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has not
returned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; I
have written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of
Amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the
world. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things
were to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your
relations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to
your wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for
her. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal
reason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his
wishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows
what he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopher
and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day;
and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron
nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution,
self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the
kindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for the
noble work that he is doing for mankind--work both in theory and
practice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I
tell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in
him. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenra
to-morrow again. She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may not
alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call.

"Yours always,

"JOHN SEWARD."


_Letter, Abraham Van Helsing, M. D., D. Ph., D. Lit., etc., etc., to Dr.
Seward._

"_2 September._

"My good Friend,--

"When I have received your letter I am already coming to you. By good
fortune I can leave just at once, without wrong to any of those who have
trusted me. Were fortune other, then it were bad for those who have
trusted, for I come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holds
dear. Tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound so
swiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our other
friend, too nervous, let slip, you did more for him when he wants my
aids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do. But it
is pleasure added to do for him, your friend; it is to you that I come.
Have then rooms for me at the Great Eastern Hotel, so that I may be near
to hand, and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not too
late on to-morrow, for it is likely that I may have to return here that
night. But if need be I shall come again in three days, and stay longer
if it must. Till then good-bye, my friend John.

 "VAN HELSING."


_Letter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood._

"_3 September._

"My dear Art,--

"Van Helsing has come and gone. He came on with me to Hillingham, and
found that, by Lucy's discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that
we were alone with her. Van Helsing made a very careful examination of
the patient. He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for of
course I was not present all the time. He is, I fear, much concerned,
but says he must think. When I told him of our friendship and how you
trust to me in the matter, he said: 'You must tell him all you think.
Tell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am not
jesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.' I asked
what he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was when we had
come back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his
return to Amsterdam. He would not give me any further clue. You must not
be angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that all his
brains are working for her good. He will speak plainly enough when the
time comes, be sure. So I told him I would simply write an account of
our visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for
_The Daily Telegraph_. He seemed not to notice, but remarked that the
smuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a
student here. I am to get his report to-morrow if he can possibly make
it. In any case I am to have a letter.

"Well, as to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first
saw her, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of the
ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was
very sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him
feel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hard
struggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick
look under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat of
all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite
geniality that I could see poor Lucy's pretense of animation merge into
reality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation
gently round to his visit, and suavely said:--

"'My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so
much beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do not
see. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a
ghastly pale. To them I say: "Pouf!"' And he snapped his fingers at me
and went on: 'But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How can
he'--and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with
which once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a
particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of--'know anything
of a young ladies? He has his madams to play with, and to bring them
back to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and,
oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But the
young ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell
themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many
sorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to
smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all
to ourselves.' I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the
professor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, but
said: 'I have made careful examination, but there is no functional
cause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it has
been, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way anmic. I have
asked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question,
that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say.
And yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must go
back home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and if
there be cause I shall come again. The disease--for not to be all well
is a disease--interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me
too. She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.'

"As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.
And so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trust
your poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, my
dear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who
are both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, and
you are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to
come at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from
me."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_4 September._--Zophagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.
He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just
before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew
the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a
run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so
violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five
minutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank
into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. The
attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really
appalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the
other patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite
understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was
some distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and
as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen,
woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show
something directly. I cannot quite understand it.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Another change in my patient. At five o'clock I looked in on
him, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. He
was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture
by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of
padding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad
conduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to
his own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well to
humour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has the
sugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a
harvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into a
box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find
a spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any
clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not
rise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of
far-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:--

"All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do
it for myself!" Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said:
"Doctor, won't you be very good to me and let me have a little more
sugar? I think it would be good for me."

"And the flies?" I said.

"Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I like
it." And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do
not argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man
as, I suppose, any in the world. I wish I could fathom his mind.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Midnight._--Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra,
whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our
own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. As
his room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in
the morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky
beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows
and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul
water, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone
building, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart
to endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from
his window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less
frenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an
inert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectual
recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up
quite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to
hold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straight
over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his
fly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut
the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprised
me, so I asked him: "Are you not going to keep flies any more?"

"No," said he; "I am sick of all that rubbish!" He certainly is a
wonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of his
mind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clue
after all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noon
and at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at
periods which affects certain natures--as at times the moon does others?
We shall see.

CHAPTER X


_Letter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood._

"_6 September._

"My dear Art,--

"My news to-day is not so good. Lucy this morning had gone back a bit.
There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs.
Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me
professionally about her. I took advantage of the opportunity, and told
her that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming to
stay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly with
myself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a
shock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy's weak
condition, might be disastrous to her. We are hedged in with
difficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please God, we shall
come through them all right. If any need I shall write, so that, if you
do not hear from me, take it for granted that I am simply waiting for
news. In haste

Yours ever,

"JOHN SEWARD."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_7 September._--The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at
Liverpool Street was:--

"Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?"

"No," I said. "I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. I
wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss
Westenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be."

"Right, my friend," he said, "quite right! Better he not know as yet;
perhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then he
shall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal
with the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch
as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God's madmen,
too--the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why
you do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledge
in its place, where it may rest--where it may gather its kind around it
and breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here." He
touched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself
the same way. "I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall
unfold to you."

"Why not now?" I asked. "It may do some good; we may arrive at some
decision." He stopped and looked at me, and said:--

"My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has
ripened--while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine
has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the
ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff,
and say to you: 'Look! he's good corn; he will make good crop when the
time comes.'" I did not see the application, and told him so. For reply
he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as
he used long ago to do at lectures, and said: "The good husbandman tell
you so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the
good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for
the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of
the work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn,
and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all,
there's some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell." He broke
off, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and very
gravely:--

"You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever more
full than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, and
I trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that
knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.
Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that this
case of our dear miss is one that may be--mind, I say _may be_--of such
interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the
beam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too
small. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.
Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We
learn from failure, not from success!"

When I described Lucy's symptoms--the same as before, but infinitely
more marked--he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him a
bag in which were many instruments and drugs, "the ghastly paraphernalia
of our beneficial trade," as he once called, in one of his lectures, the
equipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in,
Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I
expected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained
that even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case
where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some
cause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in her
daughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. It is
something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an
envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that
which it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered
selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice
of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have
knowledge of.

I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down
a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness
more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that
I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were
shown up to Lucy's room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I
was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the
red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of
her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or
hear. Van Helsing's face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged
till they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not
seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then
Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The
instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to
the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and
closed the door. "My God!" he said; "this is dreadful. There is no time
to be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart's
action as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is
it you or me?"

"I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me."

"Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared."

I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at
the hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the
door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in
an eager whisper:--

"Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and
have been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for
myself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you,
sir, for coming." When first the Professor's eye had lit upon him he had
been angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in
his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which
seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to
him gravely as he held out his hand:--

"Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is
bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that." For he
suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. "You are to
help her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your
best help."

"What can I do?" asked Arthur hoarsely. "Tell me, and I shall do it. My
life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for
her." The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old
knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--

"My young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last!"

"What shall I do?" There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril
quivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. "Come!"
he said. "You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than
me, better than my friend John." Arthur looked bewildered, and the
Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--

"Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have
or die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform
what we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one to
the empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he is
the more young and strong than me"--here Arthur took my hand and wrung
it hard in silence--"but, now you are here, you are more good than us,
old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not
so calm and our blood not so bright than yours!" Arthur turned to him
and said:--

"If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would
understand----"

He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.

"Good boy!" said Van Helsing. "In the not-so-far-off you will be happy
that you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. You
shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you
must leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with
her! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!"

We all went up to Lucy's room. Arthur by direction remained outside.
Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not
asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke
to us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid
them on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and
coming over to the bed, said cheerily:--

"Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good
child. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes." She had made
the effort with success.

It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked
the extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to
flicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest
its potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was
satisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his
coat. Then he added: "You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring
over the table. Friend John, help to me!" So neither of us looked whilst
he bent over her.

Van Helsing turning to me, said:

"He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not
defibrinate it."

Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the
operation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come
back to poor Lucy's cheeks, and through Arthur's growing pallor the joy
of his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow
anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he
was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy's system must
have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.
But the Professor's face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with
his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own
heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: "Do not stir an instant.
It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her." When all was over I
could see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his
arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--the
man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--

"The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have
presently." And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the
pillow to the patient's head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band
which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old
diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up,
and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I
could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing's
ways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to
me, saying: "Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port
wine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleep
much and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to
his love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir,
that you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all ways
the operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and you
can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell
her all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you
have done. Good-bye."

When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently,
but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her
breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.
The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a
whisper:--

"What do you make of that mark on her throat?"

"What do you make of it?"

"I have not examined it yet," I answered, and then and there proceeded
to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two
punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of
disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some
trituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it
was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned
the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed
would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must
have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.

"Well?" said Van Helsing.

"Well," said I, "I can make nothing of it." The Professor stood up. "I
must go back to Amsterdam to-night," he said. "There are books and
things there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you
must not let your sight pass from her."

"Shall I have a nurse?" I asked.

"We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that
she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep all
the night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as
possible. And then we may begin."

"May begin?" I said. "What on earth do you mean?"

"We shall see!" he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment
later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held
up:--

"Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, you
shall not sleep easy hereafter!"


_Dr. Seward's Diary--continued._

_8 September._--I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself
off towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being
from what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good,
and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the
absolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenra
that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she
almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter's renewed
strength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and made
preparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the
night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by
the bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me
gratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed
sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together
and shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort
and with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that she
did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:--

"You do not want to go to sleep?"

"No; I am afraid."

"Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for."

"Ah, not if you were like me--if sleep was to you a presage of horror!"

"A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?"

"I don't know; oh, I don't know. And that is what is so terrible. All
this weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought."

"But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, and
I can promise that nothing will happen."

"Ah, I can trust you!" I seized the opportunity, and said: "I promise
you that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once."

"You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will
sleep!" And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank
back, asleep.

All night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and on
in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips were
slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a
pendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad
dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.

In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took
myself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a short
wire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result
of the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all
day to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my
zophagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the
past day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst
I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, as
it might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the
night mail and would join me early in the morning.

       *       *       *       *       *

_9 September_.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to
Hillingham. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my
brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral
exhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands
with me she looked sharply in my face and said:--

"No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well
again; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who
will sit up with you." I would not argue the point, but went and had my
supper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I
made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than
excellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next
her own, where a cozy fire was burning. "Now," she said, "you must stay
here. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on the
sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to
bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything I
shall call out, and you can come to me at once." I could not but
acquiesce, for I was "dog-tired," and could not have sat up had I tried.
So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything,
I lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.


_Lucy Westenra's Diary._

_9 September._--I feel so happy to-night. I have been so miserably weak,
that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after
a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very,
very close to me. I seem to feel his presence warm about me. I suppose
it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner
eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Love
rein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills. I know
where my thoughts are. If Arthur only knew! My dear, my dear, your ears
must tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the blissful rest of
last night! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me.
And to-night I shall not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand and
within call. Thank everybody for being so good to me! Thank God!
Good-night, Arthur.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_10 September._--I was conscious of the Professor's hand on my head, and
started awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learn
in an asylum, at any rate.

"And how is our patient?"

"Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me," I answered.

"Come, let us see," he said. And together we went into the room.

The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van
Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.

As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I
heard the Professor's low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a
deadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and
his exclamation of horror, "Gott in Himmel!" needed no enforcement from
his agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his
iron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble.

There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly
white and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gums
seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a
corpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp
in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit
stood to him, and he put it down again softly. "Quick!" he said. "Bring
the brandy." I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter.
He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and
wrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonising
suspense said:--

"It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work is
undone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I have
to call on you yourself this time, friend John." As he spoke, he was
dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I
had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no
possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so,
without a moment's delay, we began the operation. After a time--it did
not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one's blood, no
matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling--Van Helsing
held up a warning finger. "Do not stir," he said, "but I fear that with
growing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much
danger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection
of morphia." He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his
intent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge
subtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride
that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid
cheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to
feel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.

The Professor watched me critically. "That will do," he said. "Already?"
I remonstrated. "You took a great deal more from Art." To which he
smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:--

"He is her lover, her _fianc_. You have work, much work, to do for her
and for others; and the present will suffice."

When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied
digital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited his
leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-by
he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for
myself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half
whispered:--

"Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up
unexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him and
enjealous him, too. There must be none. So!"

When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:--

"You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and
rest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me."

I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I
had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. I
felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at
what had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over
and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how
she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to
show for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,
sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little
punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their
edges--tiny though they were.

Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and
strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsing
had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict
injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his
voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.

Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything
had happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother
came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but
said to me gratefully:--

"We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really
must now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking pale
yourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you
do!" As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,
for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted
drain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned
imploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my
lips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.

Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me:
"Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. I
stay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You and
I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave
reasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to think
even the most not-probable. Good-night."

In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of
them might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; and
when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing's wish that either he or I should sit
up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the "foreign
gentleman." I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because
I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy's account, that
their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen
similar instances of woman's kindness. I got back here in time for a
late dinner; went my rounds--all well; and set this down whilst waiting
for sleep. It is coming.

       *       *       *       *       *

_11 September._--This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found Van
Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I had
arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it
with much impressment--assumed, of course--and showed a great bundle of
white flowers.

"These are for you, Miss Lucy," he said.

"For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!"

"Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines." Here
Lucy made a wry face. "Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or
in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall
point out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing
so much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss,
that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but
you do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and
hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the
lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters
of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought
for in the Floridas, and find him all too late."

Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling
them. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and
half-disgust:--

"Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why,
these flowers are only common garlic."

To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his
iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--

"No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do;
and I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of
others if not for your own." Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might
well be, he went on more gently: "Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear
me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so
common flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the
wreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so
inquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;
and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait
for you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shall
help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem,
where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.
I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here."

We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor's
actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia
that I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them
securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over
the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get
in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed
all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round
the fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and
presently I said:--

"Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but
this certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he
would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit."

"Perhaps I am!" he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which
Lucy was to wear round her neck.

We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she
was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her
neck. The last words he said to her were:--

"Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do
not to-night open the window or the door."

"I promise," said Lucy, "and thank you both a thousand times for all
your kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such
friends?"

As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:--

"To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want--two nights of travel,
much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,
and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early
you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much
more strong for my 'spell' which I have work. Ho! ho!"

He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights
before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must
have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but
I felt it all the more, like unshed tears.




CHAPTER XI

_Lucy Westenra's Diary._


_12 September._--How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr.
Van Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He
positively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been
right, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread
being alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not
mind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I
have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness,
or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has
for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no
dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings
nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep,
and lying like Ophelia in the play, with "virgin crants and maiden
strewments." I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful!
There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good-night,
everybody.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_13 September._--Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual,
up to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The
Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.

Let all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at
eight o'clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the
fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature's
annual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours,
but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met
Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an early
riser. She greeted us warmly and said:--

"You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still
asleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I
should disturb her." The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He
rubbed his hands together, and said:--

"Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working," to
which she answered:--

"You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy's state this
morning is due in part to me."

"How you do mean, ma'am?" asked the Professor.

"Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into
her room. She was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming did
not wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those
horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually
a bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be
too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away
and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be
pleased with her, I am sure."

She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As
she had spoken, I watched the Professor's face, and saw it turn ashen
grey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady
was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be;
he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into
her room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and
forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.

Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He
raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat
his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,
and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs
that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised
his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. "God! God!
God!" he said. "What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that
we are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the
pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor
mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such
thing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we
must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are
beset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!" Suddenly he
jumped to his feet. "Come," he said, "come, we must see and act. Devils
or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him
all the same." He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we
went up to Lucy's room.

Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.
This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same
awful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and
infinite pity.

"As I expected," he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which
meant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then
began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another
operation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised the
necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a
warning hand. "No!" he said. "To-day you must operate. I shall provide.
You are weakened already." As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled
up his shirt-sleeve.

Again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to
the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time I
watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.

Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must
not remove anything from Lucy's room without consulting him; that the
flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour
was a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case
himself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would
send me word when to come.

After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and
seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.

What does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life
amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.


_Lucy Westenra's Diary._

_17 September._--Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strong
again that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through some
long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and
feel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim
half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness
in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress
more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to
life as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since,
however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems
to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my
wits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed
so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and
commanded me to do I know not what--have all ceased. I go to bed now
without any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown
quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from
Haarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a
day in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left
alone. Thank God for mother's sake, and dear Arthur's, and for all our
friends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, for
last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I found
him asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again,
although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against
the window-panes.


_"The Pall Mall Gazette," 18 September._

                           THE ESCAPED WOLF.

         PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER.

         _Interview with the Keeper in the Zological Gardens._

After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using
the words "Pall Mall Gazette" as a sort of talisman, I managed to find
the keeper of the section of the Zological Gardens in which the wolf
department is included. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in
the enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to
his tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,
elderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their
hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty
comfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called "business"
until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the
table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:--

"Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You'll excoose me
refoosin' to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I gives the
wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore
I begins to arsk them questions."

"How do you mean, ask them questions?" I queried, wishful to get him
into a talkative humour.

"'Ittin' of them over the 'ead with a pole is one way; scratchin' of
their hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orf
to their gals. I don't so much mind the fust--the 'ittin' with a pole
afore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they've 'ad their
sherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the
ear-scratchin'. Mind you," he added philosophically, "there's a deal of
the same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here's you a-comin' and
arskin' of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like that
only for your bloomin' 'arf-quid I'd 'a' seen you blowed fust 'fore I'd
answer. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic-like if I'd like you to
arsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions. Without offence
did I tell yer to go to 'ell?"

"You did."

"An' when you said you'd report me for usin' of obscene language that
was 'ittin' me over the 'ead; but the 'arf-quid made that all right. I
weren't a-goin' to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my 'owl
as the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor' love yer 'art, now
that the old 'ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an' rinsed
me out with her bloomin' old teapot, and I've lit hup, you may scratch
my ears for all you're worth, and won't git even a growl out of me.
Drive along with your questions. I know what yer a-comin' at, that 'ere
escaped wolf."

"Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how it
happened; and when I know the facts I'll get you to say what you
consider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will
end."

"All right, guv'nor. This 'ere is about the 'ole story. That 'ere wolf
what we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from
Norway to Jamrach's, which we bought off him four years ago. He was a
nice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I'm more
surprised at 'im for wantin' to get out nor any other animile in the
place. But, there, you can't trust wolves no more nor women."

"Don't you mind him, sir!" broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh. "'E's
got mindin' the animiles so long that blest if he ain't like a old wolf
'isself! But there ain't no 'arm in 'im."

"Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin' yesterday when I first
hear my disturbance. I was makin' up a litter in the monkey-house for a
young puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin' and 'owlin' I kem
away straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin' like a mad thing at the
bars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn't much people about that
day, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a 'ook
nose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin' through it. He
had a 'ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him,
for it seemed as if it was 'im as they was hirritated at. He 'ad white
kid gloves on 'is 'ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says:
'Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.'

"'Maybe it's you,' says I, for I did not like the airs as he give
'isself. He didn't git angry, as I 'oped he would, but he smiled a kind
of insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. 'Oh no, they
wouldn't like me,' 'e says.

"'Ow yes, they would,' says I, a-imitatin' of him. 'They always likes a
bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you 'as a
bagful.'

"Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin' they
lay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears
same as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn't put
in his hand and stroke the old wolf's ears too!

"'Tyke care,' says I. 'Bersicker is quick.'

"'Never mind,' he says. 'I'm used to 'em!'

"'Are you in the business yourself?' I says, tyking off my 'at, for a
man what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers.

"'No' says he, 'not exactly in the business, but I 'ave made pets of
several.' And with that he lifts his 'at as perlite as a lord, and walks
away. Old Bersicker kep' a-lookin' arter 'im till 'e was out of sight,
and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn't come hout the 'ole
hevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves
here all began a-'owling. There warn't nothing for them to 'owl at.
There warn't no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin' a
dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twice
I went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the 'owling
stopped. Just before twelve o'clock I just took a look round afore
turnin' in, an', bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker's
cage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. And
that's all I know for certing."

"Did any one else see anything?"

"One of our gard'ners was a-comin' 'ome about that time from a 'armony,
when he sees a big grey dog comin' out through the garding 'edges. At
least, so he says, but I don't give much for it myself, for if he did 'e
never said a word about it to his missis when 'e got 'ome, and it was
only after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all
night-a-huntin' of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein'
anything. My own belief was that the 'armony 'ad got into his 'ead."

"Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the
wolf?"

"Well, sir," he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, "I think I can;
but I don't know as 'ow you'd be satisfied with the theory."

"Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from
experience, can't hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?"

"Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that 'ere
wolf escaped--simply because he wanted to get out."

From the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I
could see that it had done service before, and that the whole
explanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn't cope in badinage
with the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart,
so I said:--

"Now, Mr. Bilder, we'll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,
and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you've told me
what you think will happen."

"Right y'are, sir," he said briskly. "Ye'll excoose me, I know, for
a-chaffin' of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much
as telling me to go on."

"Well, I never!" said the old lady.

"My opinion is this: that 'ere wolf is a-'idin' of, somewheres. The
gard'ner wot didn't remember said he was a-gallopin' northward faster
than a horse could go; but I don't believe him, for, yer see, sir,
wolves don't gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein' built that
way. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets
in packs and does be chivyin' somethin' that's more afeared than they is
they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But,
Lor' bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so
clever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in
'im. This one ain't been used to fightin' or even to providin' for
hisself, and more like he's somewhere round the Park a-'idin' an'
a-shiverin' of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin' where he is to get
his breakfast from; or maybe he's got down some area and is in a
coal-cellar. My eye, won't some cook get a rum start when she sees his
green eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can't get food he's
bound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher's
shop in time. If he doesn't, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin' orf with
a soldier, leavin' of the hinfant in the perambulator--well, then I
shouldn't be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That's
all."

I was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up
against the window, and Mr. Bilder's face doubled its natural length
with surprise.

"God bless me!" he said. "If there ain't old Bersicker come back by
'isself!"

He went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding it
seemed to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so
well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a
personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.

After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor
his wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animal
itself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all
picture-wolves--Red Riding Hood's quondam friend, whilst moving her
confidence in masquerade.

The whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The
wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the
children in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of
penitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine
prodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender
solicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:--

"There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble;
didn't I say it all along? Here's his head all cut and full of broken
glass. 'E's been a-gettin' over some bloomin' wall or other. It's a
shyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles.
This 'ere's what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker."

He took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat that
satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the
fatted calf, and went off to report.

I came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given
to-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_17 September._--I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my
books, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy,
had fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and in
rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was
thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord
into the Superintendent's study is almost unknown. Without an instant's
pause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and,
as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was
too quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my
balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.
Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was
sprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a
little pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not
intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,
keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the
attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment
positively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking
up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He was
easily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite
placidly, simply repeating over and over again: "The blood is the life!
The blood is the life!"

I cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much of
late for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy's
illness and its horrible phases is telling on me. I am over-excited and
weary, and I need rest, rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not summoned
me, so I need not forego my sleep; to-night I could not well do without
it.


_Telegram, Van Helsing, Antwerp, to Seward, Carfax._

(Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given; delivered late by
twenty-two hours.)

"_17 September._--Do not fail to be at Hillingham to-night. If not
watching all the time frequently, visit and see that flowers are as
placed; very important; do not fail. Shall be with you as soon as
possible after arrival."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_18 September._--Just off for train to London. The arrival of Van
Helsing's telegram filled me with dismay. A whole night lost, and I know
by bitter experience what may happen in a night. Of course it is
possible that all may be well, but what _may_ have happened? Surely
there is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident
should thwart us in all we try to do. I shall take this cylinder with
me, and then I can complete my entry on Lucy's phonograph.


_Memorandum left by Lucy Westenra._

_17 September. Night._--I write this and leave it to be seen, so that no
one may by any chance get into trouble through me. This is an exact
record of what took place to-night. I feel I am dying of weakness, and
have barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in the
doing.

I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr.
Van Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.

I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that
sleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I
know so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in
the next room--as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be--so that I might have
called him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to me
the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep
would try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be
alone, I opened my door and called out: "Is there anybody there?" There
was no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.
Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog's, but
more fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could
see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its
wings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determined
not to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in;
seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She
said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:--

"I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all
right."

I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in
and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did
not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while
and then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in
hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was
startled and a little frightened, and cried out: "What is that?" I tried
to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could
hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was
the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a
crash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.
The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the
aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey
wolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting
posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst
other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing
insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a
second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange
and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over--as if struck
with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a
moment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my
eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole
myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken
window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that
travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to
stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother's poor body,
which seemed to grow cold already--for her dear heart had ceased to
beat--weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.

The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered
consciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the
dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,
seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and
stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the
nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort
me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear
their bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they
came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay
over me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the
broken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my
dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I
had got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them
to go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew
open for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went
in a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear
mother's breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing
had told me, but I didn't like to remove them, and, besides, I would
have some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that
the maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went
to the dining-room to look for them.

My heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helpless
on the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table
half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious,
and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the
sideboard, I found that the bottle which mother's doctor uses for
her--oh! did use--was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am back
in the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for
the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I
dare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the
broken window.

The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from
the window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? God
shield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast,
where they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother
gone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear Arthur, if I should not
survive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!




CHAPTER XII

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


_18 September._--I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.
Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently
and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her
mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,
finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed
the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an
hour--for it was now ten o'clock--and so rang and knocked again, but
more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only
the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this
desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing
tight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too
late? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of
danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;
and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry
anywhere.

I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and
locked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the
rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse's feet. They stopped at the
gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.
When he saw me, he gasped out:--

"Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you
not get my telegram?"

I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his
telegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here,
and that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused and
raised his hat as he said solemnly:--

"Then I fear we are too late. God's will be done!" With his usual
recuperative energy, he went on: "Come. If there be no way open to get
in, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now."

We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen
window. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and
handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I
attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then
with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and
opened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There
was no one in the kitchen or in the servants' rooms, which were close at
hand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,
dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four
servant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead,
for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the
room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at
each other, and as we moved away he said: "We can attend to them later."
Then we ascended to Lucy's room. For an instant or two we paused at the
door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white
faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the
room.

How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her
mother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white
sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the
broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror
fixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more
drawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her
mother's bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds
which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.
Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching
poor Lucy's breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who
listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:--

"It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!"

I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste
it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found
on the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I
fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure,
but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another
occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her
hands. He said to me:--

"I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids.
Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them
get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as
that beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anything
more."

I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the
women. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently
affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her
sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to
them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with
them, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life
was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice
Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad
as they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and
boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We
got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst
we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One
of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then
she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come
with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he
must wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message,
and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.

I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly
earnest. I knew--as he knew--that it was a stand-up fight with death,
and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not
understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--

"If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade
away into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon." He went
on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.

Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to
be of some effect. Lucy's heart beat a trifle more audibly to the
stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing's
face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in
a hot sheet to dry her he said to me:--

"The first gain is ours! Check to the King!"

We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid
her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed
that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was
still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had
ever seen her.

Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her
and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me
out of the room.

"We must consult as to what is to be done," he said as we descended the
stairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he
closing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but
the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of
death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly
observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light
enough for our purposes. Van Helsing's sternness was somewhat relieved
by a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about
something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--

"What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have
another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl's life
won't be worth an hour's purchase. You are exhausted already; I am
exhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have
courage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his
veins for her?"

"What's the matter with me, anyhow?"

The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought
relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van
Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a
glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: "Quincey Morris!" and
rushed towards him with outstretched hands.

"What brought you here?" I cried as our hands met.

"I guess Art is the cause."

He handed me a telegram:--

"Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.
Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.
Do not delay.--HOLMWOOD."

"I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell
me what to do."

Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in
the eyes as he said:--

"A brave man's blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in
trouble. You're a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against
us for all he's worth, but God sends us men when we want them."

Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart
to go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it
told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her
veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other
occasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see
and hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van
Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with
good effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched
whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids
to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down
after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good
breakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where
Lucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or
two of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was
thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look
of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.
He handed me the paper saying only: "It dropped from Lucy's breast when
we carried her to the bath."

When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause
asked him: "In God's name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,
mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?" I was so bewildered that I
did not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the
paper, saying:--

"Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know
and understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what
is it that you came to me to say?" This brought me back to fact, and I
was all myself again.

"I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act
properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have
to be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we
had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you
know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra
had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us
fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the
registrar and go on to the undertaker."

"Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be
sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that
love her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old
man. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the
more for it! Now go."

In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him
that Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now
going on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him
where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:--

"When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to
ourselves?" I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about
the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in
the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.

When I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him
as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still
sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her
side. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he
expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.
So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where
the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or
rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said
to me:--

"Jack Seward, I don't want to shove myself in anywhere where I've no
right to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl
and wanted to marry her; but, although that's all past and gone, I can't
help feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that's wrong
with her? The Dutchman--and a fine old fellow he is; I can see
that--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have
_another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.
Now I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a man
must not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is
no common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that
so?"

"That's so," I said, and he went on:--

"I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did
to-day. Is not that so?"

"That's so."

"And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at his
own place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quick
since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass
all in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at
her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there
wasn't enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a
bullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without
betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?" As he spoke
the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense
regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible
mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very
heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there was a
royal lot of it, too--to keep him from breaking down. I paused before
answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the
Professor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed
so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered
in the same phrase: "That's so."

"And how long has this been going on?"

"About ten days."

"Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature
that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood
of four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn't hold it." Then,
coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: "What took it
out?"

I shook my head. "That," I said, "is the crux. Van Helsing is simply
frantic about it, and I am at my wits' end. I can't even hazard a guess.
There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out
all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall
not occur again. Here we stay until all be well--or ill." Quincey held
out his hand. "Count me in," he said. "You and the Dutchman will tell me
what to do, and I'll do it."

When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy's first movement was to feel
in her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing
had given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it had
come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van
Helsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room,
and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her
poor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what that
meant--that she had realised to the full her mother's death; so we tried
what we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but
she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for
a long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain with
her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell
into a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she
took the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped
over and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, she went on
with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her
hands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering
the fragments. Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as
if in thought, but he said nothing.

       *       *       *       *       *

_19 September._--All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid
to sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. The Professor and
I took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment
unattended. Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew
that all night long he patrolled round and round the house.

When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy's
strength. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little
nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times she
slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between
sleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more
haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale
gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and
sharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently
changed the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying
one. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.
Quincey went off to meet him at the station.

When he arrived it was nearly six o'clock, and the sun was setting full
and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more
colour to the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking
with emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed,
the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had
grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible
were shortened. Arthur's presence, however, seemed to act as a
stimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she
had done since we arrived. He too pulled himself together, and spoke as
cheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything.

It was now nearly one o'clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with
her. I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering
this on Lucy's phonograph. Until six o'clock they are to try to rest. I
fear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too
great; the poor child cannot rally. God help us all.


_Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra._

(Unopened by her.)

"_17 September._

"My dearest Lucy,--

"It seems _an age_ since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote. You
will pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all my
budget of news. Well, I got my husband back all right; when we arrived
at Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had
an attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house, where there
were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together. After
dinner Mr. Hawkins said:--

"'My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity; and may every
blessing attend you both. I know you both from children, and have, with
love and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to make your home here
with me. I have left to me neither chick nor child; all are gone, and in
my will I have left you everything.' I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan and
the old man clasped hands. Our evening was a very, very happy one.

"So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my
bedroom and the drawing-room I can see the great elms of the cathedral
close, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow
stone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and
cawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of
rooks--and humans. I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things and
housekeeping. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day; for, now that
Jonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the
clients.

"How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to town for a
day or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on my
shoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still. He is beginning to
put some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the
long illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden
way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual
placidity. However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as the
days go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust. And now
I have told you my news, let me ask yours. When are you to be married,
and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear,
and is it to be a public or a private wedding? Tell me all about it,
dear; tell me all about everything, for there is nothing which interests
you which will not be dear to me. Jonathan asks me to send his
'respectful duty,' but I do not think that is good enough from the
junior partner of the important firm Hawkins & Harker; and so, as you
love me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and tenses
of the verb, I send you simply his 'love' instead. Good-bye, my dearest
Lucy, and all blessings on you.

"Yours,

"MINA HARKER."


_Report from Patrick Hennessey, M. D., M. R. C. S. L. K. Q. C. P. I.,
etc., etc., to John Seward, M. D._

"_20 September._

"My dear Sir,--

"In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of
everything left in my charge.... With regard to patient, Renfield, there
is more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had a
dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended
with any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier's cart with two men
made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours--the house to
which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped at
our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. I was
myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and
saw one of them come up to the house. As he passed the window of
Renfield's room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called
him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed a
decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to "shut up for a
foul-mouthed beggar," whereon our man accused him of robbing him and
wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to
swing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice,
so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his
mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: 'Lor' bless
yer, sir, I wouldn't mind what was said to me in a bloomin' madhouse. I
pity ye and the guv'nor for havin' to live in the house with a wild
beast like that.' Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him
where the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats
and curses and revilings from our man. I went down to see if I could
make out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a
well-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had
ever occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most
genial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he
blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe
that he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to
say, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an
hour I heard of him again. This time he had broken out through the
window of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to the
attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent
on some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which
had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden
boxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the
face, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up to him the
patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to
knock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the
moment I believe he would have killed the man there and then. The other
fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his
heavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but
seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and
fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others
were both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we
began to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat
on him, he began to shout: 'I'll frustrate them! They shan't rob me!
they shan't murder me by inches! I'll fight for my Lord and Master!' and
all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable
difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded
room. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set
it all right; and he is going on well.

"The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for
damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. Their
threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for
the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if it
had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and
raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of
him. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary
state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of
their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their
labours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood their
drift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and
with each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore
that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of
meeting so 'bloomin' good a bloke' as your correspondent. I took their
names and addresses, in case they might be needed. They are as
follows:--Jack Smollet, of Dudding's Rents, King George's Road, Great
Walworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley's Row, Guide Court, Bethnal
Green. They are both in the employment of Harris & Sons, Moving and
Shipment Company, Orange Master's Yard, Soho.

"I shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here, and shall
wire you at once if there is anything of importance.

"Believe me, dear Sir,

"Yours faithfully,

"PATRICK HENNESSEY."


_Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra_.

(Unopened by her.)

"_18 September._

"My dearest Lucy,--

"Such a sad blow has befallen us. Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly.
Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him
that it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew either
father or mother, so that the dear old man's death is a real blow to me.
Jonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he feels sorrow,
deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life,
and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a
fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the
dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account. He says the
amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. He
begins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and _my_ belief in _him_
helps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the grave
shock that he experienced tells upon him the most. Oh, it is too hard
that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his--a nature which
enabled him by our dear, good friend's aid to rise from clerk to master
in a few years--should be so injured that the very essence of its
strength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in
the midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some one,
for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan
tries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread coming
up to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr.
Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his
father. As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief
mourner. I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few
minutes. Forgive me for troubling you. With all blessings,

"Your loving

"MINA HARKER."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_20 September._--Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry
to-night. I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world
and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard
this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he has
been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late--Lucy's mother
and Arthur's father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.

I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to
go to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told him
that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not
all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed
to go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. "Come, my child," he said;
"come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much
mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You
must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.
Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two
sofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will
be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we
sleep." Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy's
face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay
quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it
should be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room,
as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the
window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy's neck, over the silk
handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of
the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and
her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her
teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they
had been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the
canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her,
and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort
of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly,
and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight,
and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled
round--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every now
and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat,
I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic
flowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat
watching her.

Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.
She took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with
her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto
so marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she
became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was
certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the
stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she
waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any
mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many
spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.

At six o'clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen
into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy's face
I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a
sharp whisper: "Draw up the blind; I want light!" Then he bent down,
and, with his face almost touching Lucy's, examined her carefully. He
removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As
he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, "Mein
Gott!" as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too,
and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.

The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.

For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face
at its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:--

"She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, mark
me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor boy, and
let him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him."

I went to the dining-room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but
when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters
he thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy
was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van
Helsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with his
hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained,
perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders
shook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. "Come," I
said, "my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best
and easiest for her."

When we came into Lucy's room I could see that Van Helsing had, with
his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making
everything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy's
hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we
came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered
softly:--

"Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!" He was stooping to
kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. "No," he whispered, "not
yet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more."

So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,
with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Then
gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her
breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child's.

And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in
the night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale
gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a
sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which
were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice,
such as I had never heard from her lips:--

"Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!" Arthur bent
eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me,
had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by
the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which
I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost
across the room.

"Not for your life!" he said; "not for your living soul and hers!" And
he stood between them like a lion at bay.

Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do
or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised
the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.

I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as
of rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed
together. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.

Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and
putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing's great brown
one; drawing it to her, she kissed it. "My true friend," she said, in a
faint voice, but with untellable pathos, "My true friend, and his! Oh,
guard him, and give me peace!"

"I swear it!" he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his
hand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and said
to him: "Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the
forehead, and only once."

Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.

Lucy's eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took
Arthur's arm, and drew him away.

And then Lucy's breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it
ceased.

"It is all over," said Van Helsing. "She is dead!"

I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he
sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that
nearly broke me down to see.

I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and
his face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over her body.
Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had
recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their
deadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working
of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as
might be.

    "We thought her dying whilst she slept,
        And sleeping when she died."

I stood beside Van Helsing, and said:--

"Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!"

He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:--

"Not so; alas! not so. It is only the beginning!"

When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered:--

"We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see."




CHAPTER XIII

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_.


The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and
her mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly
formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were
afflicted--or blessed--with something of his own obsequious suavity.
Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to
me, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out
from the death-chamber:--

"She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It's quite a privilege to
attend on her. It's not too much to say that she will do credit to our
establishment!"

I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from
the disordered state of things in the household. There were no relatives
at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his
father's funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been
bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon
ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy's
papers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a
foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and
so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:--

"I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But
this is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the
coroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more--such
as this."

As he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been
in Lucy's breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.

"When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.
Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch
here in the room and in Miss Lucy's old room all night, and I myself
search for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into
the hands of strangers."

I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found
the name and address of Mrs. Westenra's solicitor and had written to
him. All the poor lady's papers were in order; explicit directions
regarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the
letter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room,
saying:--

"Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to
you."

"Have you got what you looked for?" I asked, to which he replied:--

"I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find I
have, all that there was--only some letters and a few memoranda, and a
diary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say
nothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with
his sanction, I shall use some."

When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:--

"And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you
and I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow we shall have much to do, but
for the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!"

Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had
certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small
_chapelle ardente_. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,
and death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the
winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and
turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall
wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy's
loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed,
instead of leaving traces of "decay's effacing fingers," had but
restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes
that I was looking at a corpse.

The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and
there was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: "Remain till I
return," and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic
from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and
placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he
took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and
placed it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we
came away.

I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the
door, he entered, and at once began to speak:--

"To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem
knives."

"Must we make an autopsy?" I asked.

"Yes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell you
now, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take out
her heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen with
no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make
the rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, that
you loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall
operate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to-night, but for
Arthur I must not; he will be free after his father's funeral to-morrow,
and he will want to see her--to see _it_. Then, when she is coffined
ready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shall
unscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replace
all, so that none know, save we alone."

"But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor body
without need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothing
to gain by it--no good to her, to us, to science, to human
knowledge--why do it? Without such it is monstrous."

For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite
tenderness:--

"Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more
because it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burden
that you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you
shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant
things. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet
did you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err--I am but
man; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that you
send for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay
horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love--though she was
dying--and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you saw
how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so
weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not
hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes!

"Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many
years trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so
strange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend
John. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is
not perhaps well. And if I work--as work I shall, no matter trust or no
trust--without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel,
oh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!" He paused a
moment and went on solemnly: "Friend John, there are strange and
terrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to
a good end. Will you not have faith in me?"

I took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away,
and watched him go into his room and close the door. As I stood without
moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage--she had
her back towards me, so did not see me--and go into the room where Lucy
lay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful
to those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl
putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch
alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay
might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest....

       *       *       *       *       *

I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van
Helsing waked me by coming into my room. He came over to my bedside and
said:--

"You need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it."

"Why not?" I asked. For his solemnity of the night before had greatly
impressed me.

"Because," he said sternly, "it is too late--or too early. See!" Here he
held up the little golden crucifix. "This was stolen in the night."

"How, stolen," I asked in wonder, "since you have it now?"

"Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the
woman who robbed the dead and the living. Her punishment will surely
come, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thus
unknowing, she only stole. Now we must wait."

He went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a
new puzzle to grapple with.

The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr.
Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genial
and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all
cares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for
some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs
in absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain
entailed property of Lucy's father's which now, in default of direct
issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate,
real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had
told us so much he went on:--

"Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and
pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either
penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial
alliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into
collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out
her wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We were
right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we should
have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment.
Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of
disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her
wishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come
into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her
mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no
will--and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case--have been
treated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming,
though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the
inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just
rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assure
you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced."

He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in which
he was officially interested--of so great a tragedy, was an
object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.

He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and
see Lord Godalming. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to
us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile
criticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o'clock, so
a little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was so in
very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker,
true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and
there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at
once. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,
explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be
less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his _fiance_
quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and
exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them
the night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings
as we could avoid were saved.

Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart
manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his
much-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly
attached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a
bitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he
was sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some
constraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to
bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I
felt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and
led me in, saying huskily:--

"You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was
no friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don't know how to
thank you for all you have done for her. I can't think yet...."

Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and
laid his head on my breast, crying:--

"Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from me
all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for."

I comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much
expression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the
shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man's
heart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said
softly to him:--

"Come and look at her."

Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.
God! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her
loveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he
fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At
last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:--

"Jack, is she really dead?"

I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest--for I felt
that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than
I could help--that it often happened that after death faces became
softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was
especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged
suffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after
kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and
long, he turned aside. I told him that that must be good-bye, as the
coffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in his
and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away,
fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.

I left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said
good-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker's men
to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When he
came out of the room again I told him of Arthur's question, and he
replied:--

"I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!"

We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make
the best of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner-time; but
when we had lit our cigars he said--

"Lord----"; but Arthur interrupted him:--

"No, no, not that, for God's sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me, sir:
I did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is so
recent."

The Professor answered very sweetly:--

"I only used that name because I was in doubt. I must not call you
'Mr.,' and I have grown to love you--yes, my dear boy, to love you--as
Arthur."

Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man's warmly.

"Call me what you will," he said. "I hope I may always have the title of
a friend. And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for
your goodness to my poor dear." He paused a moment, and went on: "I know
that she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was
rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so--you remember"--the
Professor nodded--"you must forgive me."

He answered with a grave kindness:--

"I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such
violence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not--that you
cannot--trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may be
more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot--and may
not--and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trust
shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as
though the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from
first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her
dear sake to whom I swore to protect."

"And, indeed, indeed, sir," said Arthur warmly, "I shall in all ways
trust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are
Jack's friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like."

The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to
speak, and finally said:--

"May I ask you something now?"

"Certainly."

"You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?"

"No, poor dear; I never thought of it."

"And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. I
want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy's papers and
letters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which,
be sure, she would have approved. I have them all here. I took them
before we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch
them--no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall keep
them, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them
safe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back
to you. It's a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for
Lucy's sake?"

Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:--

"Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this I
am doing what my dear one would have approved. I shall not trouble you
with questions till the time comes."

The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:--

"And you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not be
all pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too--you most of
all, my dear boy--will have to pass through the bitter water before we
reach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our
duty, and all will be well!"

I slept on a sofa in Arthur's room that night. Van Helsing did not go to
bed at all. He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was
never out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with
the wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose,
a heavy, overpowering smell into the night.


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_22 September._--In the train to Exeter. Jonathan sleeping.

It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much
between then, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and
no news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a
partner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and
Jonathan with another attack that may harm him. Some day he may ask me
about it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my shorthand--see what
unexpected prosperity does for us--so it may be as well to freshen it up
again with an exercise anyhow....

The service was very simple and very solemn. There were only ourselves
and the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, his
London agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the
President of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand in
hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us....

We came back to town quietly, taking a 'bus to Hyde Park Corner.
Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, so
we sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was
sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us think
of the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down Piccadilly.
Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old days
before I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you can't go on
for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the
pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and he
was my husband, and we didn't know anybody who saw us--and we didn't
care if they did--so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful
girl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano's,
when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said
under his breath: "My God!" I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I
fear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to him
quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.

He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and
half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and
black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty
girl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us,
and so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good face; it was
hard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all
the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal's.
Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice. I
feared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I asked
Jonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently thinking that
I knew as much about it as he did: "Do you see who it is?"

"No, dear," I said; "I don't know him; who is it?" His answer seemed to
shock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it was
to me, Mina, to whom he was speaking:--

"It is the man himself!"

The poor dear was evidently terrified at something--very greatly
terrified; I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to
support him he would have sunk down. He kept staring; a man came out of
the shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove
off. The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage
moved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a
hansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself:--

"I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this be
so! Oh, my God! my God! If I only knew! if I only knew!" He was
distressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the
subject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent. I drew him
away quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. We walked a little
further, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It was
a hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place.
After a few minutes' staring at nothing, Jonathan's eyes closed, and he
went quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder. I thought it
was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In about twenty
minutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully:--

"Why, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so rude.
Come, and we'll have a cup of tea somewhere." He had evidently forgotten
all about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all that
this episode had reminded him of. I don't like this lapsing into
forgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain. I must
not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but I must somehow
learn the facts of his journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when I
must open that parcel, and know what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you will,
I know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--A sad home-coming in every way--the house empty of the dear
soul who was so good to us; Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight
relapse of his malady; and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he
may be:--

"You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and
that Lucy died the day before yesterday. They were both buried to-day."

Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! Poor Mrs. Westenra! poor
Lucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us! And poor, poor Arthur, to have
lost such sweetness out of his life! God help us all to bear our
troubles.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_22 September._--It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has
taken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believe
in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy's death as any
of us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If America
can go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the world
indeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his
journey. He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returns
to-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which can
only be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he says
he has work to do in London which may take him some time. Poor old
fellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his
iron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see, putting
some terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we were
standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in
the operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy's veins; I
could see Van Helsing's face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was
saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married
and that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us said a word of
the other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went
away together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The
moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of
hysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted
that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very
terrible conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down
the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried,
till he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as a woman
does. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the
circumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different in
manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his face grew
grave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time.
His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and
forceful and mysterious. He said:--

"Ah, you don't comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad,
though I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me. But
no more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come
just the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your
door and say, 'May I come in?' is not the true laughter. No! he is a
king, and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose no
time of suitability. He say, 'I am here.' Behold, in example I grieve my
heart out for that so sweet young girl; I give my blood for her, though
I am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other
sufferers want that so she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very
grave--laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her
coffin and say 'Thud! thud!' to my heart, till it send back the blood
from my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy--that dear boy, so of
the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his
hair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him so. And yet
when he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my
father-heart yearn to him as to no other man--not even to you, friend
John, for we are more level in experiences than father and son--yet even
at such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear,
'Here I am! here I am!' till the blood come dance back and bring some of
the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend John, it is
a strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and
troubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the
tune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and
tears that burn as they fall--all dance together to the music that he
make with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that
he is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn
tight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and,
like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain
become too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like the
sunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with
our labour, what it may be."

I did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as I
did not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him. As he
answered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different
tone:--

"Oh, it was the grim irony of it all--this so lovely lady garlanded with
flowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if she
were truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely
churchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the mother
who loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going 'Toll!
toll! toll!' so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the white
garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time
their eyes never on the page; and all of us with the bowed head. And all
for what? She is dead; so! Is it not?"

"Well, for the life of me, Professor," I said, "I can't see anything to
laugh at in all that. Why, your explanation makes it a harder puzzle
than before. But even if the burial service was comic, what about poor
Art and his trouble? Why, his heart was simply breaking."

"Just so. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had
made her truly his bride?"

"Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him."

"Quite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John. If so that, then
what about the others? Ho, ho! Then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist,
and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church's law, though
no wits, all gone--even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife,
am bigamist."

"I don't see where the joke comes in there either!" I said; and I did
not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. He laid
his hand on my arm, and said:--

"Friend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not my feeling to others
when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust.
If you could have looked into my very heart then when I want to laugh;
if you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do so
now, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him--for
he go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time--maybe you would
perhaps pity me the most of all."

I was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.

"Because I know!"

And now we are all scattered; and for many a long day loneliness will
sit over our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy lies in the tomb of her
kin, a lordly death-house in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming
London; where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill,
and where wild flowers grow of their own accord.

So I can finish this diary; and God only knows if I shall ever begin
another. If I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal with
different people and different themes; for here at the end, where the
romance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my
life-work, I say sadly and without hope,

                        "FINIS."


_"The Westminster Gazette," 25 September._

                          A HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY.


The neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a
series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what
was known to the writers of headlines as "The Kensington Horror," or
"The Stabbing Woman," or "The Woman in Black." During the past two or
three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from
home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath. In all
these cases the children were too young to give any properly
intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses
is that they had been with a "bloofer lady." It has always been late in
the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the
children have not been found until early in the following morning. It is
generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed
gave as his reason for being away that a "bloofer lady" had asked him to
come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as
occasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of the
little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. A
correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to
be the "bloofer lady" is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists
might, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the
reality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general
principles of human nature that the "bloofer lady" should be the popular
rle at these _al fresco_ performances. Our correspondent navely says
that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of
these grubby-faced little children pretend--and even imagine
themselves--to be.

There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of
the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been
slightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be
made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance
individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has
a system or method of its own. The police of the division have been
instructed to keep a sharp look-out for straying children, especially
when very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog
which may be about.

We have just received intelligence that another child, missed last
night, was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at the
Shooter's Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is, perhaps, less
frequented than the other parts. It has the same tiny wound in the
throat as has been noticed in other cases. It was terribly weak, and
looked quite emaciated. It too, when partially restored, had the common
story to tell of being lured away by the "bloofer lady."




CHAPTER XIV

MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


_23 September_.--Jonathan is better after a bad night. I am so glad that
he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terrible
things; and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the
responsibility of his new position. I knew he would be true to himself,
and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the height of his
advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon
him. He will be away all day till late, for he said he could not lunch
at home. My household work is done, so I shall take his foreign journal,
and lock myself up in my room and read it....


_24 September_.--I hadn't the heart to write last night; that terrible
record of Jonathan's upset me so. Poor dear! How he must have suffered,
whether it be true or only imagination. I wonder if there is any truth
in it at all. Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those
terrible things, or had he some cause for it all? I suppose I shall
never know, for I dare not open the subject to him.... And yet that man
we saw yesterday! He seemed quite certain of him.... Poor fellow! I
suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some
train of thought.... He believes it all himself. I remember how on our
wedding-day he said: "Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to
the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane." There seems to be
through it all some thread of continuity.... That fearful Count was
coming to London.... If it should be, and he came to London, with his
teeming millions.... There may be a solemn duty; and if it come we must
not shrink from it.... I shall be prepared. I shall get my typewriter
this very hour and begin transcribing. Then we shall be ready for other
eyes if required. And if it be wanted; then, perhaps, if I am ready,
poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never let
him be troubled or worried with it at all. If ever Jonathan quite gets
over the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all, and I can ask him
questions and find out things, and see how I may comfort him.


_Letter, Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker._

"_24 September._

(_Confidence_)

"Dear Madam,--

"I pray you to pardon my writing, in that I am so far friend as that I
sent to you sad news of Miss Lucy Westenra's death. By the kindness of
Lord Godalming, I am empowered to read her letters and papers, for I am
deeply concerned about certain matters vitally important. In them I find
some letters from you, which show how great friends you were and how you
love her. Oh, Madam Mina, by that love, I implore you, help me. It is
for others' good that I ask--to redress great wrong, and to lift much
and terrible troubles--that may be more great than you can know. May it
be that I see you? You can trust me. I am friend of Dr. John Seward and
of Lord Godalming (that was Arthur of Miss Lucy). I must keep it private
for the present from all. I should come to Exeter to see you at once if
you tell me I am privilege to come, and where and when. I implore your
pardon, madam. I have read your letters to poor Lucy, and know how good
you are and how your husband suffer; so I pray you, if it may be,
enlighten him not, lest it may harm. Again your pardon, and forgive me.

"VAN HELSING."


_Telegram, Mrs. Harker to Van Helsing._

"_25 September._--Come to-day by quarter-past ten train if you can catch
it. Can see you any time you call.

"WILHELMINA HARKER."

MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL.

_25 September._--I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time
draws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect that
it will throw some light upon Jonathan's sad experience; and as he
attended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me all about
her. That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her
sleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the real
truth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my
imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Of
course it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and that
awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgotten
in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told him
of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about
it; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that he may
understand. I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs.
Westenra; I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it even
a negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy. I hope, too, Dr. Van
Helsing will not blame me; I have had so much trouble and anxiety of
late that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.

I suppose a cry does us all good at times--clears the air as other rain
does. Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, and
then Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day
and night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage. I do
hope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will
occur to upset him. It is two o'clock, and the doctor will be here soon
now. I shall say nothing of Jonathan's journal unless he asks me. I am
so glad I have type-written out my own journal, so that, in case he asks
about Lucy, I can hand it to him; it will save much questioning.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--He has come and gone. Oh, what a strange meeting, and how it
all makes my head whirl round! I feel like one in a dream. Can it be all
possible, or even a part of it? If I had not read Jonathan's journal
first, I should never have accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor, dear
Jonathan! How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this may
not upset him again. I shall try to save him from it; but it may be even
a consolation and a help to him--terrible though it be and awful in its
consequences--to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did
not deceive him, and that it is all true. It may be that it is the doubt
which haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matter
which--waking or dreaming--may prove the truth, he will be more
satisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be a
good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur's friend and Dr.
Seward's, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after
Lucy. I feel from having seen him that he _is_ good and kind and of a
noble nature. When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan;
and then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good
end. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan's
friend on "The Exeter News" told him that memory was everything in such
work--that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word
spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rare
interview; I shall try to record it _verbatim_.

It was half-past two o'clock when the knock came. I took my courage _
deux mains_ and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and
announced "Dr. Van Helsing."

I rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium weight,
strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest and
a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poise
of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the
head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face,
clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobile
mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive
nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the
mouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost
straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart;
such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it,
but falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are set
widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man's moods. He
said to me:--

"Mrs. Harker, is it not?" I bowed assent.

"That was Miss Mina Murray?" Again I assented.

"It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear
child Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead I come."

"Sir," I said, "you could have no better claim on me than that you were
a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra." And I held out my hand. He took
it and said tenderly:--

"Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be
good, but I had yet to learn----" He finished his speech with a courtly
bow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at
once began:--

"I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to begin
to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you were
with her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary--you need not look
surprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in
imitation of you--and in that diary she traces by inference certain
things to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In
great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much
kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember."

"I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it."

"Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not always
so with young ladies."

"No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to you
if you like."

"Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour." I
could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit--I suppose it is
some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our
mouths--so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful
bow, and said:--

"May I read it?"

"If you wish," I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for
an instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed.

"Oh, you so clever woman!" he said. "I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a
man of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things.
And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?
Alas! I know not the shorthand." By this time my little joke was over,
and I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my
workbasket and handed it to him.

"Forgive me," I said: "I could not help it; but I had been thinking that
it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not
have time to wait--not on my account, but because I know your time must
be precious--I have written it out on the typewriter for you."

He took it and his eyes glistened. "You are so good," he said. "And may
I read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read."

"By all means," I said, "read it over whilst I order lunch; and then you
can ask me questions whilst we eat." He bowed and settled himself in a
chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers,
whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be
disturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and down
the room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me and
took me by both hands.

"Oh, Madam Mina," he said, "how can I say what I owe to you? This paper
is as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I am daze, I am dazzle, with so
much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. But that
you do not, cannot, comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you so
clever woman. Madam"--he said this very solemnly--"if ever Abraham Van
Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know.
It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as a
friend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you
and those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there are lights;
you are one of the lights. You will have happy life and good life, and
your husband will be blessed in you."

"But, doctor, you praise me too much, and--and you do not know me."

"Not know you--I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and
women; I, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to
him and all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that you
have so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every
line. I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your
marriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell
all their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that
angels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of
angels' eyes. Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for
you trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. And your
husband--tell me of him. Is he quite well? Is all that fever gone, and
is he strong and hearty?" I saw here an opening to ask him about
Jonathan, so I said:--

"He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins's
death." He interrupted:--

"Oh, yes, I know, I know. I have read your last two letters." I went
on:--

"I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last he
had a sort of shock."

"A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That was not good. What kind of
a shock was it?"

"He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something
which led to his brain fever." And here the whole thing seemed to
overwhelm me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he
experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that
has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose I
was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to
him, and implored him to make my husband well again. He took my hands
and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held my
hand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness:--

"My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not
had much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned to here by
my friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such
nobility that I feel more than ever--and it has grown with my advancing
years--the loneliness of my life. Believe, me, then, that I come here
full of respect for you, and you have given me hope--hope, not in what I
am seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life
happy--good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for
the children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some
use to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my
study and experience. I promise you that I will gladly do _all_ for him
that I can--all to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happy
one. Now you must eat. You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious.
Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he like not
where he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake you must eat
and smile. You have told me all about Lucy, and so now we shall not
speak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Exeter to-night, for I
want to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought I
will ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me of
husband Jonathan's trouble so far as you can, but not yet. You must eat
now; afterwards you shall tell me all."

After lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, he said to me:--

"And now tell me all about him." When it came to speaking to this great
learned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and
Jonathan a madman--that journal is all so strange--and I hesitated to go
on. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I
trusted him, so I said:--

"Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not
laugh at me or at my husband. I have been since yesterday in a sort of
fever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I
have even half believed some very strange things." He reassured me by
his manner as well as his words when he said:--

"Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which
I am here, it is you who would laugh. I have learned not to think little
of any one's belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried to keep
an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close
it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that
make one doubt if they be mad or sane."

"Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a weight off my
mind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is long,
but I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble and
Jonathan's. It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that
happened. I dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself and
judge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell
me what you think."

"I promise," he said as I gave him the papers; "I shall in the morning,
so soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I may."

"Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch
with us and see him then; you could catch the quick 3:34 train, which
will leave you at Paddington before eight." He was surprised at my
knowledge of the trains off-hand, but he does not know that I have made
up all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan in
case he is in a hurry.

So he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit here
thinking--thinking I don't know what.

_Letter (by hand), Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker._

"_25 September, 6 o'clock._

"Dear Madam Mina,--

"I have read your husband's so wonderful diary. You may sleep without
doubt. Strange and terrible as it is, it is _true_! I will pledge my
life on it. It may be worse for others; but for him and you there is no
dread. He is a noble fellow; and let me tell you from experience of men,
that one who would do as he did in going down that wall and to that
room--ay, and going a second time--is not one to be injured in
permanence by a shock. His brain and his heart are all right; this I
swear, before I have even seen him; so be at rest. I shall have much to
ask him of other things. I am blessed that to-day I come to see you, for
I have learn all at once so much that again I am dazzle--dazzle more
than ever, and I must think.

"Yours the most faithful,

"ABRAHAM VAN HELSING."


_Letter, Mrs. Harker to Van Helsing._

"_25 September, 6:30 p. m._

"My dear Dr. Van Helsing,--

"A thousand thanks for your kind letter, which has taken a great weight
off my mind. And yet, if it be true, what terrible things there are in
the world, and what an awful thing if that man, that monster, be really
in London! I fear to think. I have this moment, whilst writing, had a
wire from Jonathan, saying that he leaves by the 6:25 to-night from
Launceston and will be here at 10:18, so that I shall have no fear
to-night. Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with us, please come
to breakfast at eight o'clock, if this be not too early for you? You can
get away, if you are in a hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will bring
you to Paddington by 2:35. Do not answer this, as I shall take it that,
if I do not hear, you will come to breakfast.

"Believe me,

"Your faithful and grateful friend,

"MINA HARKER."


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_26 September._--I thought never to write in this diary again, but the
time has come. When I got home last night Mina had supper ready, and
when we had supped she told me of Van Helsing's visit, and of her having
given him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been
about me. She showed me in the doctor's letter that all I wrote down was
true. It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the doubt as to the
reality of the whole thing that knocked me over. I felt impotent, and in
the dark, and distrustful. But, now that I _know_, I am not afraid, even
of the Count. He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting
to London, and it was he I saw. He has got younger, and how? Van Helsing
is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like what
Mina says. We sat late, and talked it all over. Mina is dressing, and I
shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over....

He was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where he
was, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned my
face round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny:--

"But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock." It was
so funny to hear my wife called "Madam Mina" by this kindly,
strong-faced old man. I smiled, and said:--

"I _was_ ill, I _have_ had a shock; but you have cured me already."

"And how?"

"By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and then everything
took a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even the
evidence of my own senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not know
what to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been
the groove of my life. The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrusted
myself. Doctor, you don't know what it is to doubt everything, even
yourself. No, you don't; you couldn't with eyebrows like yours." He
seemed pleased, and laughed as he said:--

"So! You are physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am with
so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will
pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife." I
would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply nodded
and stood silent.

"She is one of God's women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men and
other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its
light can be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an
egoist--and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and
selfish. And you, sir--I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy,
and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from the
knowing of others; but I have seen your true self since last night. You
will give me your hand, will you not? And let us be friends for all our
lives."

We shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite
choky.

"And now," he said, "may I ask you for some more help? I have a great
task to do, and at the beginning it is to know. You can help me here.
Can you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on I
may ask more help, and of a different kind; but at first this will do."

"Look here, sir," I said, "does what you have to do concern the Count?"

"It does," he said solemnly.

"Then I am with you heart and soul. As you go by the 10:30 train, you
will not have time to read them; but I shall get the bundle of papers.
You can take them with you and read them in the train."

After breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were parting he
said:--

"Perhaps you will come to town if I send to you, and take Madam Mina
too."

"We shall both come when you will," I said.

I had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous
night, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for the
train to start, he was turning them over. His eyes suddenly seemed to
catch something in one of them, "The Westminster Gazette"--I knew it by
the colour--and he grew quite white. He read something intently,
groaning to himself: "Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! so soon!" I do not
think he remembered me at the moment. Just then the whistle blew, and
the train moved off. This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out of
the window and waved his hand, calling out: "Love to Madam Mina; I shall
write so soon as ever I can."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_26 September._--Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week
since I said "Finis," and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather
going on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to
think of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as
he ever was. He was already well ahead with his fly business; and he had
just started in the spider line also; so he had not been of any trouble
to me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it I
gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is with
him, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well of
good spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that
Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to
them all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was settling down to my
work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I might
fairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming
cicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the
end God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows,
too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. He
went to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he came
back, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o'clock,
and thrust last night's "Westminster Gazette" into my hand.

"What do you think of that?" he asked as he stood back and folded his
arms.

I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but he
took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed
away at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached a
passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. An
idea struck me, and I looked up. "Well?" he said.

"It is like poor Lucy's."

"And what do you make of it?"

"Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that injured
her has injured them." I did not quite understand his answer:--

"That is true indirectly, but not directly."

"How do you mean, Professor?" I asked. I was a little inclined to take
his seriousness lightly--for, after all, four days of rest and freedom
from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one's spirits--but
when I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of our
despair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.

"Tell me!" I said. "I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what to
think, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture."

"Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to
what poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by
events, but by me?"

"Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood."

"And how the blood lost or waste?" I shook my head. He stepped over and
sat down beside me, and went on:--

"You are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is bold;
but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your ears
hear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to
you. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand,
and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But
there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men's
eyes, because they know--or think they know--some things which other men
have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to
explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to
explain. But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs,
which think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretend
to be young--like the fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do not
believe in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialisation. No? Nor
in astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor in
hypnotism----"

"Yes," I said. "Charcot has proved that pretty well." He smiled as he
went on: "Then you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of course then you
understand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great
Charcot--alas that he is no more!--into the very soul of the patient
that he influence. No? Then, friend John, am I to take it that you
simply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion
be a blank? No? Then tell me--for I am student of the brain--how you
accept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading. Let me tell you, my
friend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science which
would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered
electricity--who would themselves not so long before have been burned
as wizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was it that
Methuselah lived nine hundred years, and 'Old Parr' one hundred and
sixty-nine, and yet that poor Lucy, with four men's blood in her poor
veins, could not live even one day? For, had she live one more day, we
could have save her. Do you know all the mystery of life and death? Do
you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the
qualities of brutes are in some men, and not in others? Can you tell me
why, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived
for centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew,
till, on descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps? Can
you tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats that
come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their
veins; how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang
on the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant
nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that
it is hot, flit down on them, and then--and then in the morning are
found dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?"

"Good God, Professor!" I said, starting up. "Do you mean to tell me that
Lucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such a thing is here in London
in the nineteenth century?" He waved his hand for silence, and went
on:--

"Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of
men; why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties; and
why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint?
Can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are
some few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men and
women who cannot die? We all know--because science has vouched for the
fact--that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of
years, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of
the world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die
and have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and the
corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then men
come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indian
fakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?" Here
I interrupted him. I was getting bewildered; he so crowded on my mind
his list of nature's eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my
imagination was getting fired. I had a dim idea that he was teaching me
some lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam; but
he used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object of
thought in mind all the time. But now I was without this help, yet I
wanted to follow him, so I said:--

"Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, so
that I may apply your knowledge as you go on. At present I am going in
my mind from point to point as a mad man, and not a sane one, follows an
idea. I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist, jumping
from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without
knowing where I am going."

"That is good image," he said. "Well, I shall tell you. My thesis is
this: I want you to believe."

"To believe what?"

"To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once
of an American who so defined faith: 'that faculty which enables us to
believe things which we know to be untrue.' For one, I follow that man.
He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of
truth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railway
truck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value
him; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in
the universe."

"Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the
receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. Do I read
your lesson aright?"

"Ah, you are my favourite pupil still. It is worth to teach you. Now
that you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to
understand. You think then that those so small holes in the children's
throats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy?"

"I suppose so." He stood up and said solemnly:--

"Then you are wrong. Oh, would it were so! but alas! no. It is worse,
far, far worse."

"In God's name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?" I cried.

He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his
elbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke:--

"They were made by Miss Lucy!"




CHAPTER XV

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_.


For a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during her life
struck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to
him:--

"Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?" He raised his head and looked at me, and
somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. "Would I were!" he
said. "Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, my
friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell
you so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all
my life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted,
now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a
fearful death? Ah no!"

"Forgive me," said I. He went on:--

"My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you,
for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do not
expect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract
truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always
believed the 'no' of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a
concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To-night I go to prove
it. Dare you come with me?"

This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron
excepted from the category, jealousy.

    "And prove the very truth he most abhorred."

He saw my hesitation, and spoke:--

"The logic is simple, no madman's logic this time, jumping from tussock
to tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief;
at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet
very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come,
I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child
in the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers
say the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were
in class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he
will not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we
wish to learn. And then----"

"And then?" He took a key from his pocket and held it up. "And then we
spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is
the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give to
Arthur." My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful
ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what
heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was
passing....

We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and
altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its
throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the
similarity to those which had been on Lucy's throat. They were smaller,
and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he
attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some
animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think
that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern
heights of London. "Out of so many harmless ones," he said, "there may
be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some
sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from
the Zological Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred
there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago
a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a
week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the
Heath and in every alley in the place until this 'bloofer lady' scare
came along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even
this poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he
might go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted
to play with the 'bloofer lady.'"

"I hope," said Van Helsing, "that when you are sending the child home
you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies
to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another
night, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you will
not let it away for some days?"

"Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not
healed."

Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and
the sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark it
was, he said:--

"There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek
somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way."

We dined at "Jack Straw's Castle" along with a little crowd of
bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o'clock we
started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps
made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual
radius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he
went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to
locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at
last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse
police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of
the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty--for
it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us--we found
the Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door,
and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to
precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the
courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My
companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after
carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring,
one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he
fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle,
proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed
with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some
days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites
turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the
beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured
stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished
brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a
candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been
imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--was
not the only thing which could pass away.

Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so
that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm
dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he
made assurance of Lucy's coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took
out a turnscrew.

"What are you going to do?" I asked.

"To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced." Straightway he began
taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the
casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed
to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have
stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took
hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: "You shall see," and again
fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew
through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he
made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of
the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We
doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to
such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never
stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of
the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the
edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the
coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to
look.

I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.

It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but
Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground,
and so emboldened to proceed in his task. "Are you satisfied now, friend
John?" he asked.

I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as
I answered him:--

"I am satisfied that Lucy's body is not in that coffin; but that only
proves one thing."

"And what is that, friend John?"

"That it is not there."

"That is good logic," he said, "so far as it goes. But how do you--how
can you--account for it not being there?"

"Perhaps a body-snatcher," I suggested. "Some of the undertaker's people
may have stolen it." I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was
the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. "Ah
well!" he said, "we must have more proof. Come with me."

He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed
them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the
bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and
locked it. He handed me the key, saying: "Will you keep it? You had
better be assured." I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am
bound to say--as I motioned him to keep it. "A key is nothing," I said;
"there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock
of that kind." He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he
told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at
the other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark
figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my
sight.

It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant
clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and
unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand
and with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly
observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had
a dreary, miserable time.

Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white
streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard
farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the
Professor's side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I
too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I
stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an
early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered
juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim
figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden
by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the
rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and
coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When
he saw me he held it out to me, and said:--

"Are you satisfied now?"

"No," I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.

"Do you not see the child?"

"Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?" I
asked.

"We shall see," said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way
out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.

When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of
trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child's throat. It was
without a scratch or scar of any kind.

"Was I right?" I asked triumphantly.

"We were just in time," said the Professor thankfully.

We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted
about it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to
give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should
have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.
So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we
heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find
it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out
well. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman's heavy
tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until
he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation
of astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a
cab near the "Spaniards," and drove to town.

I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours'
sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shall
go with him on another expedition.

       *       *       *       *       *

_27 September._--It was two o'clock before we found a suitable
opportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed,
and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily
away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw
the sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till
morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not
want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the
reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of
place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were
incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless.
Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead
nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to
open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own
eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however,
and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road,
no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again
courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as
last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine
streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy's coffin, and I followed.
He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock
of surprise and dismay shot through me.

There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her
funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I
could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than
before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.

"Is this a juggle?" I said to him.

"Are you convinced now?" said the Professor in response, and as he spoke
he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the
dead lips and showed the white teeth.

"See," he went on, "see, they are even sharper than before. With this
and this"--and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below
it--"the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend
John?" Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I _could_ not
accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to
argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:--

"She may have been placed here since last night."

"Indeed? That is so, and by whom?"

"I do not know. Some one has done it."

"And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not
look so." I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did not
seem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor
triumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising
the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and
examining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:--

"Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is
some dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire
when she was in a trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not know
that, friend John, but you shall know it all later--and in trance could
he best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she
is Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when
the Un-Dead sleep at home"--as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of
his arm to designate what to a vampire was "home"--"their face show what
they are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back to
the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so
it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep." This turned my blood
cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing's
theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the
idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in
my face, for he said almost joyously:--

"Ah, you believe now?"

I answered: "Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to
accept. How will you do this bloody work?"

"I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall
drive a stake through her body." It made me shudder to think of so
mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling
was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to
shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing
called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective,
or all objective?

I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as
if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a
snap, and said:--

"I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I
did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is
to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are
thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is
simple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act
now would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have to
want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the
wounds on Lucy's throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child's at
the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full
to-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more
beautiful in a whole week, after she die--if you know of this and know
of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard,
and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect
Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when I
took him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven me
because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say
good-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea
this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have
killed her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that
have killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yet
he never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he will
sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint
his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he
will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,
an Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, since
I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he
must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow,
must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to
him; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind is
made up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and see
that all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this
churchyard in my own way. To-morrow night you will come to me to the
Berkeley Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too,
and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later we
shall all have work to do. I come with you so far as Piccadilly and
there dine, for I must be back here before the sun set."

So we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the
churchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.


_Note left by Van Helsing in his portmanteau, Berkeley Hotel directed to
John Seward, M. D._

(Not delivered.)

"_27 September._

"Friend John,--

"I write this in case anything should happen. I go alone to watch in
that churchyard. It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, shall not
leave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager.
Therefore I shall fix some things she like not--garlic and a
crucifix--and so seal up the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead,
and will heed. Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; they
may not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead is
desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may
be. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise,
and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For Miss
Lucy or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is there that
she is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter.
He is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all
along he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy's life, and
we lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are strong. He have always the
strength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strength
to Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolf and
I know not what. So if it be that he come thither on this night he shall
find me; but none other shall--until it be too late. But it may be that
he will not attempt the place. There is no reason why he should; his
hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the
Un-Dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch.

"Therefore I write this in case.... Take the papers that are with this,
the diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this
great Un-Dead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake
through it, so that the world may rest from him.

"If it be so, farewell.

"VAN HELSING."



_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_28 September._--It is wonderful what a good night's sleep will do for
one. Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing's monstrous
ideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on
common sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. I wonder if his
mind can have become in any way unhinged. Surely there must be _some_
rational explanation of all these mysterious things. Is it possible that
the Professor can have done it himself? He is so abnormally clever that
if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to
some fixed idea in a wonderful way. I am loath to think it, and indeed
it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that Van
Helsing was mad; but anyhow I shall watch him carefully. I may get some
light on the mystery.

       *       *       *       *       *

_29 September, morning._.... Last night, at a little before ten o'clock,
Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing's room; he told us all that he
wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all
our wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped we would
all come with him too, "for," he said, "there is a grave duty to be done
there. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?" This query was
directly addressed to Lord Godalming.

"I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much trouble
around my house of late that I could do without any more. I have been
curious, too, as to what you mean. Quincey and I talked it over; but the
more we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself
that I'm about up a tree as to any meaning about anything."

"Me too," said Quincey Morris laconically.

"Oh," said the Professor, "then you are nearer the beginning, both of
you, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can
even get so far as to begin."

It was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of
mind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he said
with intense gravity:--

"I want your permission to do what I think good this night. It is, I
know, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you will
know, and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that you promise me
in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a
time--I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may
be--you shall not blame yourselves for anything."

"That's frank anyhow," broke in Quincey. "I'll answer for the Professor.
I don't quite see his drift, but I swear he's honest; and that's good
enough for me."

"I thank you, sir," said Van Helsing proudly. "I have done myself the
honour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear
to me." He held out a hand, which Quincey took.

Then Arthur spoke out:--

"Dr. Van Helsing, I don't quite like to 'buy a pig in a poke,' as they
say in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman
or my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise.
If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of
these two, then I give my consent at once; though for the life of me, I
cannot understand what you are driving at."

"I accept your limitation," said Van Helsing, "and all I ask of you is
that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first
consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your
reservations."

"Agreed!" said Arthur; "that is only fair. And now that the
_pourparlers_ are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?"

"I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at
Kingstead."

Arthur's face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:--

"Where poor Lucy is buried?" The Professor bowed. Arthur went on: "And
when there?"

"To enter the tomb!" Arthur stood up.

"Professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon me,
I see that you are in earnest." He sat down again, but I could see that
he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was
silence until he asked again:--

"And when in the tomb?"

"To open the coffin."

"This is too much!" he said, angrily rising again. "I am willing to be
patient in all things that are reasonable; but in this--this desecration
of the grave--of one who----" He fairly choked with indignation. The
Professor looked pityingly at him.

"If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend," he said, "God knows I
would. But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, and
for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!"

Arthur looked up with set white face and said:--

"Take care, sir, take care!"

"Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?" said Van Helsing.
"And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. Shall I go
on?"

"That's fair enough," broke in Morris.

After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort:--

"Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong to
her. But if she be not dead----"

Arthur jumped to his feet.

"Good God!" he cried. "What do you mean? Has there been any mistake; has
she been buried alive?" He groaned in anguish that not even hope could
soften.

"I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go no
further than to say that she might be Un-Dead."

"Un-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or what
is it?"

"There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they
may solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But
I have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?"

"Heavens and earth, no!" cried Arthur in a storm of passion. "Not for
the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr.
Van Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you should
torture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to
cast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad that speak such things, or
am I mad to listen to them? Don't dare to think more of such a
desecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have a
duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do
it!"

Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and
said, gravely and sternly:--

"My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty
to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask you
now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when
later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its
fulfilment even than I am, then--then I shall do my duty, whatever it
may seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship's wishes I shall
hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where
you will." His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of
pity:--

"But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life of
acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring
my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if
the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from
you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can
to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so
much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land
to do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and
then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her--I
am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness--I gave what you
gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her
lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights
and days--before death, after death; and if my death can do her good
even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely." He
said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected
by it. He took the old man's hand and said in a broken voice:--

"Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I
shall go with you and wait."




CHAPTER XVI

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_


It was just a quarter before twelve o'clock when we got into the
churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams
of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across
the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly
in front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked
well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so
sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it
that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant
to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural
hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by
entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.
He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped
forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--

"You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that
coffin?"

"It was." The Professor turned to the rest saying:--

"You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me." He
took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur
looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped
forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,
at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead,
the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away
again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.
Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and
recoiled.

The coffin was empty!

For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by
Quincey Morris:--

"Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn't ask
such a thing ordinarily--I wouldn't so dishonour you as to imply a
doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.
Is this your doing?"

"I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor
touched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and
I came here--with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which
was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and
saw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in
day-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?"

"Yes."

"That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing,
and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came
here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here
all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable
that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,
which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last
night there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away my
garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But
bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me
outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.
So"--here he shut the dark slide of his lantern--"now to the outside."
He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the
door behind him.

Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of
that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing
gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and
passing--like the gladness and sorrow of a man's life; how sweet it was
to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how
humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to
hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each
in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I
could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the
mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to
throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing's conclusions. Quincey
Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and
accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to
stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of
tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a
definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like
thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white
napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like
dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the
mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin
strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its
setting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,
asked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near
also, as they too were curious. He answered:--

"I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter."

"And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?" asked Quincey.
"Great Scott! Is this a game?"

"It is."

"What is that which you are using?" This time the question was by
Arthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:--

"The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence." It was an
answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually
that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor's, a
purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was
impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places
assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any
one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself
been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I,
who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink
within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or
yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree
or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so
mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a
woeful presage through the night.

There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the
Professor a keen "S-s-s-s!" He pointed; and far down the avenue of yews
we saw a white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held something
dark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of
moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling
prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.
We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a
fair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a
child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We
were starting forward, but the Professor's warning hand, seen by us as
he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the
white figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see
clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice,
and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of
Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was
turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous
wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we
all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the
tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the
concentrated light that fell on Lucy's face we could see that the lips
were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her
chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.

We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even
Van Helsing's iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had
not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.

When Lucy--I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her
shape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives
when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy's eyes in form
and colour; but Lucy's eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of
the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love
passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have
done it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy
light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God,
how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to
the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had
clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls
over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There
was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when
she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell
back and hid his face in his hands.

She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,
said:--

"Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are
hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!"

There was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of the
tingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of us
who heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under
a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She
was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between
them his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a
suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter
the tomb.

When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if
arrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was
shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no
quiver from Van Helsing's iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled
malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by
mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw
out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of
the flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes, and the lovely,
blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of
the Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death--if looks could
kill--we saw it at that moment.

And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained
between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of
entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:--

"Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?"

Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he
answered:--

"Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like
this ever any more;" and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I
simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the
click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close
to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred
emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified
amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal
body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice
where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of
relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty
to the edges of the door.

When this was done, he lifted the child and said:

"Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a
funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The
friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock
the gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of
to-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow
night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find
him, as on the other night; and then to home." Coming close to Arthur,
he said:--

"My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look
back, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter
waters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, have
passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn
overmuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me."

Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other
on the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all
slept with more or less reality of sleep.

       *       *       *       *       *

_29 September, night._--A little before twelve o'clock we three--Arthur,
Quincey Morris, and myself--called for the Professor. It was odd to
notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of
course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of
us wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and
strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the
gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief
that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to
ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a
long leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of
fair weight.

When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up
the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the
Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it
behind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also
two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own
ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work
by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy's coffin we all looked--Arthur
trembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all its
death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but
loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy's shape without her
soul. I could see even Arthur's face grow hard as he looked. Presently
he said to Van Helsing:--

"Is this really Lucy's body, or only a demon in her shape?"

"It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her
as she was, and is."

She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth,
the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder to
see--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a
devilish mockery of Lucy's sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual
methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and
placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some
plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in
a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue
flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a
round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about
three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and
was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such
as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To
me, a doctor's preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and
bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was
to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their
courage, and remained silent and quiet.

When all was ready, Van Helsing said:--

"Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and
experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers
of the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the
curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age
adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that
die from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and prey
on their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the
ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had met
that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night
when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died,
have become _nosferatu_, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would
all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror.
The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Those
children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if
she live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her
power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that
so wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny
wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays
unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when
this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor
lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by
night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she
shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will
be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.
To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better
right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the
night when sleep is not: 'It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it
was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would
herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?' Tell me if there be
such a one amongst us?"

We all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite
kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore
Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and
said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as
snow:--

"My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me
what I am to do, and I shall not falter!" Van Helsing laid a hand on his
shoulder, and said:--

"Brave lad! A moment's courage, and it is done. This stake must be
driven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal--be not deceived in
that--but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more
than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though
you tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Only
think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for
you all the time."

"Go on," said Arthur hoarsely. "Tell me what I am to do."

"Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the
heart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for
the dead--I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall
follow--strike in God's name, that so all may be well with the dead that
we love and that the Un-Dead pass away."

Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on
action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened
his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we
could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could
see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.

The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech
came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted
in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the
lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur
never faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm
rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst
the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His
face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it
gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little
vault.

And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the
teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The
terrible task was over.

The hammer fell from Arthur's hand. He reeled and would have fallen had
we not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead,
and his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strain
on him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human
considerations he could never have gone through with it. For a few
minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the
coffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one
to the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had
been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad,
strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of
horror that lay upon it.

There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded
and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a
privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in
her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that
there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and
pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth
to what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like
sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and
symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.

Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur's shoulder, and said to
him:--

"And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?"

The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man's hand
in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--

"Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again,
and me peace." He put his hands on the Professor's shoulder, and laying
his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood
unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:--

"And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as
she would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning
devil now--not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is
the devil's Un-Dead. She is God's true dead, whose soul is with Him!"

Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the
tomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point
of it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with
garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid,
and gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor locked
the door he gave the key to Arthur.

Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it
seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was
gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves
on one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.

Before we moved away Van Helsing said:--

"Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing
to ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author
of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we can
follow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in
it, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, all
of us--is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do
we not promise to go on to the bitter end?"

Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the
Professor as we moved off:--

"Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of
the clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that you
know not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans
unfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult
about, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shall
return to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first I
shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread.
Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a
terrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we
must not draw back."




CHAPTER XVII

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_


When we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram
waiting for him:--

     "Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important news.--MINA
     HARKER."

The Professor was delighted. "Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina," he said,
"pearl among women! She arrive, but I cannot stay. She must go to your
house, friend John. You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her _en
route_, so that she may be prepared."

When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of
a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten
copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker's diary at Whitby. "Take these," he
said, "and study them well. When I have returned you will be master of
all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep
them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your
faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. What
is here told," he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of
papers as he spoke, "may be the beginning of the end to you and me and
many another; or it may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk the
earth. Read all, I pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add in
any way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. You have
kept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then we
shall go through all these together when we meet." He then made ready
for his departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street. I
took my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before
the train came in.

The crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival
platforms; and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my
guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and,
after a quick glance, said: "Dr. Seward, is it not?"

"And you are Mrs. Harker!" I answered at once; whereupon she held out
her hand.

"I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but----" She stopped
suddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.

The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it
was a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included a
typewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had
sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom
prepared at once for Mrs. Harker.

In due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was a
lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudder
when we entered.

She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as
she had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph
diary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking at
the papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open before
me. I must get her interested in something, so that I may have an
opportunity of reading them. She does not know how precious time is, or
what a task we have in hand. I must be careful not to frighten her. Here
she is!


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_29 September._--After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward's
study. At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talking
with some one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at
the door, and on his calling out, "Come in," I entered.

To my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone,
and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the
description to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was much
interested.

"I hope I did not keep you waiting," I said; "but I stayed at the door
as I heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you."

"Oh," he replied with a smile, "I was only entering my diary."

"Your diary?" I asked him in surprise.

"Yes," he answered. "I keep it in this." As he spoke he laid his hand on
the phonograph. I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:--

"Why, this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?"

"Certainly," he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train
for speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face.

"The fact is," he began awkwardly, "I only keep my diary in it; and as
it is entirely--almost entirely--about my cases, it may be awkward--that
is, I mean----" He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his
embarrassment:--

"You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died;
for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very, very
dear to me."

To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:--

"Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!"

"Why not?" I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.
Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse.
At length he stammered out:--

"You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the
diary." Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said
with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the navet
of a child: "That's quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!" I could
not but smile, at which he grimaced. "I gave myself away that time!" he
said. "But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for months
past, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular
part of it in case I wanted to look it up?" By this time my mind was
made up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have
something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, and
I said boldly:--

"Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my
typewriter." He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said:--

"No! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn't let you know that terrible
story!"

Then it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought,
and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or
some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on
the table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking,
followed their direction. As they saw the parcel he realised my meaning.

"You do not know me," I said. "When you have read those papers--my own
diary and my husband's also, which I have typed--you will know me
better. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in
this cause; but, of course, you do not know me--yet; and I must not
expect you to trust me so far."

He is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right about
him. He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in
order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and
said:--

"You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you.
But I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you long
ago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I make
the only atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them--the
first half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify
you; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In the
meantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better
able to understand certain things." He carried the phonograph himself up
to my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something
pleasant, I am sure; for it will tell me the other side of a true love
episode of which I know one side already....


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_29 September._--I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan
Harker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without
thinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce
dinner, so I said: "She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour," and
I went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker's diary, when
she came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were
flushed with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have had
cause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me; and
now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went
straight to my heart. So I said as gently as I could:--

"I greatly fear I have distressed you."

"Oh, no, not distressed me," she replied, "but I have been more touched
than I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine, but it is
cruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.
It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear them
spoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have copied out the
words on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, as
I did."

"No one need ever know, shall ever know," I said in a low voice. She
laid her hand on mine and said very gravely:--

"Ah, but they must!"

"Must! But why?" I asked.

"Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor dear Lucy's
death and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we have
before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all
the knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the
cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know;
but I can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark
mystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all up to a certain
point; and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September,
how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought
out. Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van
Helsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and he
will be here to-morrow to help us. We need have no secrets amongst us;
working together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than
if some of us were in the dark." She looked at me so appealingly, and at
the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing,
that I gave in at once to her wishes. "You shall," I said, "do as you
like in the matter. God forgive me if I do wrong! There are terrible
things yet to learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road to
poor Lucy's death, you will not be content, I know, to remain in the
dark. Nay, the end--the very end--may give you a gleam of peace. Come,
there is dinner. We must keep one another strong for what is before us;
we have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten you shall learn
the rest, and I shall answer any questions you ask--if there be anything
which you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who were
present."


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_29 September._--After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study. He
brought back the phonograph from my room, and I took my typewriter. He
placed me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I
could touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case
I should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with his
back to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read. I
put the forked metal to my ears and listened.

When the terrible story of Lucy's death, and--and all that followed, was
done, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I am not of a
fainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a
horrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-bottle from a
cupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored
me. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all
the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy
was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without
making a scene. It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if I
had not known Jonathan's experience in Transylvania I could not have
believed. As it was, I didn't know what to believe, and so got out of my
difficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off my
typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward:--

"Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing
when he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when
he arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything,
and I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item
put in chronological order, we shall have done much. You tell me that
Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell him
when they come." He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I
began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. I used
manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with
all the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about
his work of going his round of the patients; when he had finished he
came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely
whilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full of
good men--even if there _are_ monsters in it. Before I left him I
remembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor's
perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at
Exeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the
files of "The Westminster Gazette" and "The Pall Mall Gazette," and took
them to my room. I remember how much "The Dailygraph" and "The Whitby
Gazette," of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand the
terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall look
through the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new
light. I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_30 September._--Mr. Harker arrived at nine o'clock. He had got his
wife's wire just before starting. He is uncommonly clever, if one can
judge from his face, and full of energy. If this journal be true--and
judging by one's own wonderful experiences, it must be--he is also a man
of great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time was a
remarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I was
prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet,
business-like gentleman who came here to-day.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room,
and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. They
are hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in
chronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has got
the letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the
carriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife's
typescript of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here it
is....

     Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be
     the Count's hiding-place! Goodness knows that we had enough clues
     from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters
     relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh,
     if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy!
     Stop; that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again
     collating his material. He says that by dinner-time they will be
     able to show a whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the
     meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of
     index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet,
     but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good thing
     that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could have
     found the dates otherwise....

     I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands
     folded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as any
     one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of
     subjects, all of which he treated naturally. He then, of his own
     accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my
     knowledge during his sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quite
     confidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had I
     not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of
     his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after a
     brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All
     those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the
     Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be that
     his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire's ultimate triumph?
     Stay; he is himself zophagous, and in his wild ravings outside the
     chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of "master." This
     all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came
     away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it
     safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think,
     and then--! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so
     I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to
     have a strait-waistcoat ready in case of need.


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_29 September, in train to London._--When I received Mr. Billington's
courteous message that he would give me any information in his power I
thought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such
inquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo
of the Count's to its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal
with it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and
brought me to his father's house, where they had decided that I must
stay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality:
give a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They all
knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had
ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes.
It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had
seen on the Count's table before I knew of his diabolical plans.
Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and
with precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which
might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried
out. To use an Americanism, he had "taken no chances," and the absolute
accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the
logical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it:
"Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes."
Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of
these I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could
give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs
officers and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of the
strange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local
tradition; but no one could add to the simple description "Fifty cases
of common earth." I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in
communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their
tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that
the boxes were "main and mortal heavy," and that shifting them was dry
work. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn't any
gentleman "such-like as yourself, squire," to show some sort of
appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider
that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had
elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care
before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of
reproach.

       *       *       *       *       *

_30 September._--The station-master was good enough to give me a line to
his old companion the station-master at King's Cross, so that when I
arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of
the boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper
officials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original
invoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here
limited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was
compelled to deal with the result in an _ex post facto_ manner.

From thence I went on to Carter Paterson's central office, where I met
with the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in their
day-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King's Cross
office for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming
were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending
also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the
delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing
exactly; the carriers' men were able to supplement the paucity of the
written words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connected
almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent
thirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity,
through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a
later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:--

"That 'ere 'ouse, guv'nor, is the rummiest I ever was in. Blyme! but it
ain't been touched sence a hundred years. There was dust that thick in
the place that you might have slep' on it without 'urtin' of yer bones;
an' the place was that neglected that yer might 'ave smelled ole
Jerusalem in it. But the ole chapel--that took the cike, that did! Me
and my mate, we thort we wouldn't never git out quick enough. Lor', I
wouldn't take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark."

Having been in the house, I could well believe him; but if he knew what
I know, he would, I think, have raised his terms.

Of one thing I am now satisfied: that _all_ the boxes which arrived at
Whitby from Varna in the _Demeter_ were safely deposited in the old
chapel at Carfax. There should be fifty of them there, unless any have
since been removed--as from Dr. Seward's diary I fear.

I shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax when
Renfield attacked them. By following up this clue we may learn a good
deal.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put all the papers
into order.


_Mina Harker's Journal_

_30 September._--I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself.
It is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had:
that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act
detrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a
face as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has,
however, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong, never
so full of volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as that dear, good
Professor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he improves under
strain that would kill a weaker nature. He came back full of life and
hope and determination; we have got everything in order for to-night. I
feel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose one ought to pity any
thing so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this Thing is not
human--not even beast. To read Dr. Seward's account of poor Lucy's
death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in
one's heart.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we
expected. Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with
him, so I had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for it
brought back all poor dear Lucy's hopes of only a few months ago. Of
course they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van
Helsing, too, has been quite "blowing my trumpet," as Mr. Morris
expressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all
about the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what to
say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they
had to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, and
came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post
them in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward's diary that
they had been at Lucy's death--her real death--and that I need not fear
to betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I
could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband
and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.
I gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got
his and turned it over--it does make a pretty good pile--he said:--

"Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?"

I nodded, and he went on:--

"I don't quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and
kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all
I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have
had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble
to the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy--"
Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear
the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid
a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the
room. I suppose there is something in woman's nature that makes a man
free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or
emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when
Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and
gave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I
hope he didn't think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it
afterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I
_know_ he never will--he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I
could see that his heart was breaking:--

"I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to
her. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let
me be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have
had, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can
help in your affliction, won't you let me be of some little service--for
Lucy's sake?"

In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed
to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a
vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat
his palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat
down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite
pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his
head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook with
emotion.

We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above
smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big
sorrowing man's head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby
that some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he
were my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.

After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an
apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for
days and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had been
unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of
sorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with
whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was
surrounded, he could speak freely. "I know now how I suffered," he said,
as he dried his eyes, "but I do not know even yet--and none other can
ever know--how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall
know better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful
now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be
like a brother, will you not, for all our lives--for dear Lucy's sake?"

"For dear Lucy's sake," I said as we clasped hands. "Ay, and for your
own sake," he added, "for if a man's esteem and gratitude are ever worth
the winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bring
to you a time when you need a man's help, believe me, you will not call
in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the
sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you
will let me know." He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that
I felt it would comfort him, so I said:--

"I promise."

As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window.
He turned as he heard my footsteps. "How is Art?" he said. Then noticing
my red eyes, he went on: "Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poor
old fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in
trouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him."

He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw the
manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise
how much I knew; so I said to him:--

"I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me
be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You
will know, later on, why I speak." He saw that I was in earnest, and
stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed
but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I
bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a
momentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:--

"Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long
as ever you live!" Then he went into the study to his friend.

"Little girl!"--the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he
proved himself a friend!




CHAPTER XVIII

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


_30 September._--I got home at five o'clock, and found that Godalming
and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript
of the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife
had made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the
carriers' men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gave
us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I
have lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_. When we had
finished, Mrs. Harker said:--

"Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr.
Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary
interests me so much!" She looked so appealing and so pretty that I
could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so
I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a
lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: "Why?"

"She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it," I
answered. "Oh, very well," he said; "let her come in, by all means; but
just wait a minute till I tidy up the place." His method of tidying was
peculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes
before I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was
jealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgusting
task, he said cheerfully: "Let the lady come in," and sat down on the
edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that
he could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might
have some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just
before he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I
could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She
came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command
the respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities mad
people most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and
held out her hand.

"Good-evening, Mr. Renfield," said she. "You see, I know you, for Dr.
Seward has told me of you." He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all
over intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one
of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he
said:--

"You're not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can't be,
you know, for she's dead." Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--

"Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever
saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker."

"Then what are you doing here?"

"My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward."

"Then don't stay."

"But why not?" I thought that this style of conversation might not be
pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:--

"How did you know I wanted to marry any one?" His reply was simply
contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs.
Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:--

"What an asinine question!"

"I don't see that at all, Mr. Renfield," said Mrs. Harker, at once
championing me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as
he had shown contempt to me:--

"You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so
loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of
interest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his
household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of
them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and
effects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I
cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates
lean towards the errors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_." I
positively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet
lunatic--the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met
with--talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished
gentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker's presence which had touched
some chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any
way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or
power.

We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly
quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she
began, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, for
he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the
completest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned
certain things.

"Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed,
it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being
put under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and
perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no
matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong
life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to
take human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I
tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by
the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his
blood--relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, 'For the blood is
the life.' Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has
vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn't that true,
doctor?" I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to
either think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up
his spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, I
saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs.
Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying
pleasantly to Mr. Renfield: "Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often,
under auspices pleasanter to yourself," to which, to my astonishment, he
replied:--

"Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.
May He bless and keep you!"

When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind
me. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took
ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for
many a long day.

Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a
boy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:--

"Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come
here to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I have
much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And
Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!"

As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own
diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker's suggestion; at
which the Professor interrupted me:--

"Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man's brain--a brain that a man
should have were he much gifted--and a woman's heart. The good God
fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good
combination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help
to us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible
affair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men are
determined--nay, are we not pledged?--to destroy this monster; but it is
no part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her
in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both in
waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides,
she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to
think of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she
must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and
we go alone." I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we
had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was
the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed
to come on him. "Oh that we had known it before!" he said, "for then we
might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, 'the milk
that is spilt cries not out afterwards,' as you say. We shall not think
of that, but go on our way to the end." Then he fell into a silence that
lasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for
dinner he said to Mrs. Harker:--

"I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have
put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment."

"Not up to this moment, Professor," she said impulsively, "but up to
this morning."

"But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all the
little things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one who
has told is the worse for it."

Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she
said:--

"Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. It
is my record of to-day. I too have seen the need of putting down at
present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except
what is personal. Must it go in?" The Professor read it over gravely,
and handed it back, saying:--

"It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It can
but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more
honour you--as well as more esteem and love." She took it back with
another blush and a bright smile.

And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete
and in order. The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,
and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o'clock. The rest of us
have already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all
be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this
terrible and mysterious enemy.


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_30 September._--When we met in Dr. Seward's study two hours after
dinner, which had been at six o'clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of
board or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to
which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit
next to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan sat
next to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr.
Morris--Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the
centre. The Professor said:--

"I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts
that are in these papers." We all expressed assent, and he went on:--

"Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind of
enemy with which we have to deal. I shall then make known to you
something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me.
So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure
according.

"There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they
exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the
teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane
peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that
through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not
have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. 'See! see!
I prove; I prove.' Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know--nay,
had I even guess at him--one so precious life had been spared to many of
us who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that other
poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The _nosferatu_ do not die
like the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being
stronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is
amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of
cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have
still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the
divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are
for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in
callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear
at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he
can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the
thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and
the bat--the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become
small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we to
begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having
found it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible
task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave
shudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then
where end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not
mere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward
become foul things of the night like him--without heart or conscience,
preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for
ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again?
We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God's
sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are face
to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no;
but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his
song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others are
young. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. What
say you?"

Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh so
much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I
saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch--so
strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man's hand can speak for
itself; it does not even need a woman's love to hear its music.

When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and I
in his; there was no need for speaking between us.

"I answer for Mina and myself," he said.

"Count me in, Professor," said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual.

"I am with you," said Lord Godalming, "for Lucy's sake, if for no other
reason."

Dr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his
golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took
his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right with
his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands our
solemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even
occur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing
went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work
had begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way,
as any other transaction of life:--

"Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not
without strength. We have on our side power of combination--a power
denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to
act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.
In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are
free to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to
achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.

"Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are
restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the
limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.

"All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not
at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nay
of more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the
first place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--and
secondly, because, after all, these things--tradition and
superstition--are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for
others--though not, alas! for us--on them? A year ago which of us would
have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific,
sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief
that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the
vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the
moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere
that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany
all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so
far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at
this day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the
devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we
have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the
beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy
experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the
time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the
living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow
younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though
they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he
cannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend
Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!
He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again
Jonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand--witness again
Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him
from the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather
from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as
bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John
saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at
the window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create--that noble
ship's captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance
he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He
come on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw those
sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small--we ourselves saw
Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the
tomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or
into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with
fire--solder you call it. He can see in the dark--no small power this,
in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me
through. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is even
more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.
He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey
some of nature's laws--why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the
first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come;
though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as does
that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times
can he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is
bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.
These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by
inference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he
have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place
unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at
Whitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It is
said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood
of the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no
power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this
symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to
them he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and
silent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of,
lest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his
coffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the
coffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through
him, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest.
We have seen it with our eyes.

"Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine
him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he is
clever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to
make his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what he
has been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his
name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of
Turkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time,
and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most
cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the 'land beyond the
forest.' That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his
grave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, says
Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who
were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They
learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake
Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the
records are such words as 'stregoica'--witch, 'ordog,' and
'pokol'--Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is
spoken of as 'wampyr,' which we all understand too well. There have been
from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their
graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For it
is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in
all good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest."

Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window,
and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a little
pause, and then the Professor went on:--

"And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must
proceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan
that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which
were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes
have been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be to
ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall
where we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If the
latter, we must trace----"

Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came
the sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with a
bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the
far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked
out. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the
window and threw up the sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morris's voice
without:--

"Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about
it." A minute later he came in and said:--

"It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs.
Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly. But
the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat
and sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damned
brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to
have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have
seen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art."

"Did you hit it?" asked Dr. Van Helsing.

"I don't know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood." Without
saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his
statement:--

"We must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must
either capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to
speak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.
Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of
noon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.

"And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well.
You are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to-night, you
no more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are men
and are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we
shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we
are."

All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to me
good that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their
safety--strength being the best safety--through care of me; but their
minds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow,
I could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.

Mr. Morris resumed the discussion:--

"As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right
now. Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may save
another victim."

I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so
close, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I
appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave
me out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax,
with means to get into the house.

Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman can
sleep when those she loves are in danger! I shall lie down and pretend
to sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_1 October, 4 a. m._--Just as we were about to leave the house, an
urgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see
him at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.
I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the
morning; I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:--

"He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don't
know but what, if you don't see him soon, he will have one of his
violent fits." I knew the man would not have said this without some
cause, so I said: "All right; I'll go now"; and I asked the others to
wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my "patient."

"Take me with you, friend John," said the Professor. "His case in your
diary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_
case. I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is
disturbed."

"May I come also?" asked Lord Godalming.

"Me too?" said Quincey Morris. "May I come?" said Harker. I nodded, and
we all went down the passage together.

We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more
rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was an
unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever
met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would
prevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, but
none of the others at first said anything. His request was that I would
at once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed up
with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own
existing sanity. "I appeal to your friends," he said, "they will,
perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you have
not introduced me." I was so much astonished, that the oddness of
introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and,
besides, there was a certain dignity in the man's manner, so much of
the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: "Lord
Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr.
Renfield." He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:--

"Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the
Windham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no
more. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his
youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much
patronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great
state. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have
far-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold
alliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove a
vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true
place as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure at
meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of
conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics
by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter,
conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to
one of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by
the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective
places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at
least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.
And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as
well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to
be considered as under exceptional circumstances." He made this last
appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own
charm.

I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the
conviction, despite my knowledge of the man's character and history,
that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to
tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the
necessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it
better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old
I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.
So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared
to be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him
in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of
meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said
quickly:--

"But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire to
go at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if I may. Time
presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of
the essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to put
before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so
momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment." He looked at me keenly, and
seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised
them closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:--

"Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?"

"You have," I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.
There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:--

"Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for
this concession--boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implore
in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. I
am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I
assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and
unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look,
sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which
animate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of
your friends." Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing
conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was
but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let
him go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like
all lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing at
him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting
with the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tone
which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it
afterwards--for it was as of one addressing an equal:--

"Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free
to-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me--a stranger,
without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind--Dr.
Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the
privilege you seek." He shook his head sadly, and with a look of
poignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:--

"Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the
highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete
reasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since
you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If
you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can
we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help
us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish." He still shook
his head as he said:--

"Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and
if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not my
own master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am
refused, the responsibility does not rest with me." I thought it was now
time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went
towards the door, simply saying:--

"Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night."

As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He
moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was
about to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were
groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his
petition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his
emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old
relations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing,
and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more
fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his
efforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same
constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of
which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he
wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same
sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised,
for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into
quite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up
his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a
torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his
whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--

"Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out
of this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will;
send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a
strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me go
out of this. You don't know what you do by keeping me here. I am
speaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul. You don't know
whom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell.
By all you hold sacred--by all you hold dear--by your love that is
lost--by your hope that lives--for the sake of the Almighty, take me out
of this and save my soul from guilt! Can't you hear me, man? Can't you
understand? Will you never learn? Don't you know that I am sane and
earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting
for his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!"

I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so
would bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.

"Come," I said sternly, "no more of this; we have had quite enough
already. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly."

He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then,
without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the
bed. The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I had
expected.

When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a
quiet, well-bred voice:--

"You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, later
on, that I did what I could to convince you to-night."




CHAPTER XIX

JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


_1 October, 5 a. m._--I went with the party to the search with an easy
mind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I am
so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.
Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at
all; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and
brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way
that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and
that she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all a
little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his
room we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris said
to Dr. Seward:--

"Say, Jack, if that man wasn't attempting a bluff, he is about the
sanest lunatic I ever saw. I'm not sure, but I believe that he had some
serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a
chance." Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:--

"Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I'm glad of it,
for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last
hysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn, and in
our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.
All is best as they are." Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a
dreamy kind of way:--

"I don't know but that I agree with you. If that man had been an
ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he
seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am
afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can't forget how
he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my
throat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count 'lord and
master,' and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.
That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help
him, so I suppose he isn't above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He
certainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is
best. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand,
help to unnerve a man." The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand
on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--

"Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sad
and terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we to
hope for, except the pity of the good God?" Lord Godalming had slipped
away for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silver
whistle, as he remarked:--

"That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I've got an antidote on
call." Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care
to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone
out. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out
a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four
little groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:--

"My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of
many kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has the
strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are
of the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are not
amenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong
in all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him
as we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his
touch. Keep this near your heart"--as he spoke he lifted a little silver
crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him--"put these
flowers round your neck"--here he handed to me a wreath of withered
garlic blossoms--"for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this
knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can
fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this,
which we must not desecrate needless." This was a portion of Sacred
Wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the others
was similarly equipped. "Now," he said, "friend John, where are the
skeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break house
by the window, as before at Miss Lucy's."

Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a
surgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got one to suit; after
a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty
clang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and
it slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in
Dr. Seward's diary of the opening of Miss Westenra's tomb; I fancy that
the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they
shrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped
into the open door.

"_In manus tuas, Domine!_" he said, crossing himself as he passed over
the threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have
lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. The
Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it
from within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our
lamps and proceeded on our search.

The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the
rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great
shadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there
was some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so
powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible
experience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all,
for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every
sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.

The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches
deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down
my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. The
walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of
spider's webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old
tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in the
hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each. They
had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents
in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor
lifted them. He turned to me and said:--

"You know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you know
it at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?" I had an
idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to
get admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings
found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.
"This is the spot," said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small
map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence
regarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on the
bunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for
as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale
through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we
encountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at close
quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of
his existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in
a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and
close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was
an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler
air. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not
alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the
pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had
become itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breath
exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and
intensified its loathsomeness.

Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our
enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and
terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose
above merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking
consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our
work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.

We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we
began:--

"The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then
examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some
clue as to what has become of the rest." A glance was sufficient to show
how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was
no mistaking them.

There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright,
for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted
door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my
heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to
see the high lights of the Count's evil face, the ridge of the nose, the
red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for,
as Lord Godalming said, "I thought I saw a face, but it was only the
shadows," and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction,
and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as there
were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid
walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for _him_. I
took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.

A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which
he was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, for
undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass
of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew
back. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.

For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was
seemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great
iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside,
and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the
huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver
whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered
from behind Dr. Seward's house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a
minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.
Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I
noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been
taken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had
elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to
swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their
moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look
like a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the
threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting
their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were
multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.

Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him
on the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to
recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before
him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other
dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey
ere the whole mass had vanished.

With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for
the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at
their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in
the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise.
Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of
the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves
in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to
slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something
of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our
resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and
bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found
nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all
untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.
Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when
we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been
rabbit-hunting in a summer wood.

The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.
Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and
locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket
when he had done.

"So far," he said, "our night has been eminently successful. No harm has
come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how
many boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our
first--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been
accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or
troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and
smells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have
learned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute
beasts which are to the Count's command are yet themselves not amenable
to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his
call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and
to that poor mother's cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell
from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other matters
before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not used
his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.
So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity
to cry 'check' in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the
stake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand,
and we have reason to be content with our first night's work. It may be
ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;
but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink."

The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who
was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound
from Renfield's room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,
after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.

I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so
softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than
usual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am truly
thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our
deliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not
think so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it is
settled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet
to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she
suspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a
sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all
is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. I
daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such
confidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow I shall keep
dark over to-night's doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that
has happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.

       *       *       *       *       *

_1 October, later._--I suppose it was natural that we should have all
overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no
rest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept
till the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or
three times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a
few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of
blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. She
complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in the
day. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be
that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace
them all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the
sooner the matter is attended to the better. I shall look up Thomas
Snelling to-day.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_1 October._--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor
walking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it
is quite evident that last night's work has helped to take some of the
brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the
night he suddenly said:--

"Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him
this morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may
be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,
and reason so sound." I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him
that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to
keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary
instructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against
getting any false impression from my patient. "But," he answered, "I
want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live
things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that
he had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?"

"Excuse me," I said, "but the answer is here." I laid my hand on the
type-written matter. "When our sane and learned lunatic made that very
statement of how he _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actually
nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs.
Harker entered the room." Van Helsing smiled in turn. "Good!" he said.
"Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it
is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease
such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the
folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.
Who knows?" I went on with my work, and before long was through that in
hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was
Van Helsing back in the study. "Do I interrupt?" he asked politely as he
stood at the door.

"Not at all," I answered. "Come in. My work is finished, and I am free.
I can go with you now, if you like.

"It is needless; I have seen him!"

"Well?"

"I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short.
When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with
his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen
discontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a
measure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. "Don't
you know me?" I asked. His answer was not reassuring: "I know you well
enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourself
and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed
Dutchmen!" Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable
sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at
all. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so
clever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few
happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it does
rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be
worried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her help, it
is better so."

"I agree with you with all my heart," I answered earnestly, for I did
not want him to weaken in this matter. "Mrs. Harker is better out of it.
Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have
been in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a woman,
and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time
infallibly have wrecked her."

So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker; Quincey
and Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes. I
shall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night.


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_1 October._--It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to-day;
after Jonathan's full confidence for so many years, to see him
manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This
morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though
Jonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he went
out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of
what had happened in the visit to the Count's house. And yet he must
have known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose it
must have distressed him even more than it did me. They all agreed that
it was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and
I acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I am
crying like a silly fool, when I _know_ it comes from my husband's great
love and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.

That has done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all; and
lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept
anything from him, I still keep my journal as usual. Then if he has
feared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my
heart put down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangely sad and
low-spirited to-day. I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible
excitement.

Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told
me to. I didn't feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. I
kept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to
see me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate
pressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does
seems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which
is most to be deplored. If I hadn't gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear
Lucy would be with us now. She hadn't taken to visiting the churchyard
till I came, and if she hadn't come there in the day-time with me she
wouldn't have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn't gone there at
night and asleep, that monster couldn't have destroyed her as he did.
Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder what
has come over me to-day. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew
that I had been crying twice in one morning--I, who never cried on my
own account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear--the dear
fellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I do
feel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose it is one of the lessons
that we poor women have to learn....

I can't quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing
the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying
on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield's room, which is somewhere
under this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so
profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.
All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight
seeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be
stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin
streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness
across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a
vitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must
have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy
creeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out
and looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now
close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the
wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was
more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said,
I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on
his part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the
attendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into
bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.
I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have
fallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the
morning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a
little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was
bending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of
the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.

I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I
was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my
hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the
usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn
upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the
clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim
around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,
came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently
grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I
had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to
make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my
limbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed
my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what
tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The
mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I
could see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boiling
water--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of
the door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became
concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top
of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things
began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now
whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words "a
pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night." Was it indeed some such
spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was
composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the
red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I
looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like
two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering
when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary's
Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan
had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist
in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became
black darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to
show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be
careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one's reason if there were
too much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe
something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm
them. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their
fears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do
not, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that
cannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night's sleep. Last
night tired me more than if I had not slept at all.

       *       *       *       *       *

_2 October 10 p. m._--Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must have
slept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but the
sleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and
spiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.
In the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he was
very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless
me. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him. This
is a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would be
miserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out till
dinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brighten
them up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how
tired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke
together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other
of what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from Jonathan's
manner that he had something important to communicate. I was not so
sleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to
give me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night
before. He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to
me, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... I
have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope
I have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear
comes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the
power of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.




CHAPTER XX

JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


_1 October, evening._--I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal
Green, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. The
very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had
proved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I
learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he
was only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the
responsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph
Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a
saucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable
type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all
about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog's-eared
notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the
seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick,
half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. There
were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at
197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he
deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to
scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were
chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more
fully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that
he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London. He was now
fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern
shore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to
be left out of his diabolical scheme--let alone the City itself and the
very heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west. I went back
to Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had
been taken from Carfax.

He replied:--

"Well, guv'nor, you've treated me wery 'an'some"--I had given him half a
sovereign--"an' I'll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of
Bloxam say four nights ago in the 'Are an' 'Ounds, in Pincher's Alley,
as 'ow he an' his mate 'ad 'ad a rare dusty job in a old 'ouse at
Purfect. There ain't a-many such jobs as this 'ere, an' I'm thinkin'
that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut." I asked if he could tell me
where to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address it
would be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the rest
of his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search
then and there. At the door he stopped, and said:--

"Look 'ere, guv'nor, there ain't no sense in me a-keepin' you 'ere. I
may find Sam soon, or I mayn't; but anyhow he ain't like to be in a way
to tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze.
If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on
it, I'll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. But
ye'd better be up arter 'im soon in the mornin', or maybe ye won't ketch
'im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore."

This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to
buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she
came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had
again faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way
to home. We're on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep.
Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look as
though she had been crying. Poor dear, I've no doubt it frets her to be
kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the
others. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed and
worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctors
were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful
business. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence
must rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any
circumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she
herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the
Count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.

       *       *       *       *       *

_2 October, evening._--A long and trying and exciting day. By the first
post I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on
which was written with a carpenter's pencil in a sprawling hand:--

"Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for
the depite."

I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked heavy
and sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to wake her,
but that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for
her going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home,
with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and
in ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him where I
was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should
have found out anything. I drove to Walworth and found, with some
difficulty, Potter's Court. Mr. Smollet's spelling misled me, as I asked
for Poter's Court instead of Potter's Court. However, when I had found
the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran's lodging-house.
When I asked the man who came to the door for the "depite," he shook his
head, and said: "I dunno 'im. There ain't no such a person 'ere; I never
'eard of 'im in all my bloomin' days. Don't believe there ain't nobody
of that kind livin' ere or anywheres." I took out Smollet's letter, and
as I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name
of the court might guide me. "What are you?" I asked.

"I'm the depity," he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right
track; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the
deputy's knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who
had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at
Corcoran's, had left for his work at Poplar at five o'clock that
morning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but
he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a "new-fangled ware'us";
and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve
o'clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this
I got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. One
of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a
new "cold storage" building; and as this suited the condition of a
"new-fangled ware'us," I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly
gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the
coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my
suggesting that I was willing to pay his day's wages to his foreman for
the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was
a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had
promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me
that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly,
and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--"main
heavy ones"--with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I
asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to
which he replied:--

"Well, guv'nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a
big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was a
dusty old 'ouse, too, though nothin' to the dustiness of the 'ouse we
tooked the bloomin' boxes from."

"How did you get into the houses if they were both empty?"

"There was the old party what engaged me a-waitin' in the 'ouse at
Purfleet. He 'elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curse
me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an' him a old feller,
with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn't throw
a shadder."

How this phrase thrilled through me!

"Why, 'e took up 'is end o' the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and
me a-puffin' an' a-blowin' afore I could up-end mine anyhow--an' I'm no
chicken, neither."

"How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?" I asked.

"He was there too. He must 'a' started off and got there afore me, for
when I rung of the bell he kem an' opened the door 'isself an' 'elped me
to carry the boxes into the 'all."

"The whole nine?" I asked.

"Yus; there was five in the first load an' four in the second. It was
main dry work, an' I don't so well remember 'ow I got 'ome." I
interrupted him:--

"Were the boxes left in the hall?"

"Yus; it was a big 'all, an' there was nothin' else in it." I made one
more attempt to further matters:--

"You didn't have any key?"

"Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door 'isself
an' shut it again when I druv off. I don't remember the last time--but
that was the beer."

"And you can't remember the number of the house?"

"No, sir. But ye needn't have no difficulty about that. It's a 'igh 'un
with a stone front with a bow on it, an' 'igh steps up to the door. I
know them steps, 'avin' 'ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers
what come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin's, an'
they seein' they got so much, they wanted more; but 'e took one of them
by the shoulder and was like to throw 'im down the steps, till the lot
of them went away cussin'." I thought that with this description I could
find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started
off for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the Count
could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time was
precious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of
distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task
unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked
westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house
described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs
arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long
untenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were
up. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint
had mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been
a large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been
roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.
Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards,
whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have
been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have
given some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my
experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not
but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means
discovered of gaining access to the house.

There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and
nothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything
could be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the
Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the
grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything
about the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately been
taken, but he couldn't say from whom. He told me, however, that up to
very lately there had been a notice-board of "For Sale" up, and that
perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me
something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on
the board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know
or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled
away. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I
did not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, &
Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in
Sackville Street.

The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but
uncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the
Piccadilly house--which throughout our interview he called a
"mansion"--was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I
asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and
paused a few seconds before replying:--

"It is sold, sir."

"Pardon me," I said, with equal politeness, "but I have a special reason
for wishing to know who purchased it."

Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. "It is sold,
sir," was again his laconic reply.

"Surely," I said, "you do not mind letting me know so much."

"But I do mind," he answered. "The affairs of their clients are
absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy." This was
manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with
him. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:--

"Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their
confidence. I am myself a professional man." Here I handed him my card.
"In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of
Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,
he understood, lately for sale." These words put a different complexion
on affairs. He said:--

"I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would
I like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter of
renting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur
Holmwood. If you will let me have his lordship's address I will consult
the House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his
lordship by to-night's post. It will be a pleasure if we can so far
deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his
lordship."

I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him,
gave the address at Dr. Seward's and came away. It was now dark, and I
was tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the Arated Bread Company
and came down to Purfleet by the next train.

I found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but she
made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to
think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her
inquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at
our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our
confidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of
keeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; or
else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when
any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad we
made our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing
knowledge would be torture to her.

I could not tell the others of the day's discovery till we were alone;
so after dinner--followed by a little music to save appearances even
amongst ourselves--I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.
The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me
as though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I
came away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no
difference between us.

When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in
the study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read
it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own
information; when I had finished Van Helsing said:--

"This has been a great day's work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on
the track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then
our work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must search
until we find them. Then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt the
wretch to his real death." We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr.
Morris spoke:--

"Say! how are we going to get into that house?"

"We got into the other," answered Lord Godalming quickly.

"But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had night
and a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing to
commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don't
see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key
of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the
morning." Lord Godalming's brows contracted, and he stood up and walked
about the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to
another of us:--

"Quincey's head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; we
got off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand--unless we
can find the Count's key basket."

As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at
least advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell's,
we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. For a good
while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and
bearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the
moment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....

Just a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Her
forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even
in her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she
did this morning. To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will be
herself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_1 October._--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so
rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they
always mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more
than interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after his
repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.
He was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. He did not really
care for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds and
looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I
thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked
him:--

"What about the flies these times?" He smiled on me in quite a superior
sort of way--such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio--as
he answered me:--

"The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical
of the arial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did well
when they typified the soul as a butterfly!"

I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said
quickly:--

"Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?" His madness foiled his
reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head
with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:--

"Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want." Here he brightened
up; "I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; I
have all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to
study zophagy!"

This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:--

"Then you command life; you are a god, I suppose?" He smiled with an
ineffably benign superiority.

"Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the
Deity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I
may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things
purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied
spiritually!" This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall
Enoch's appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt
that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--

"And why with Enoch?"

"Because he walked with God." I could not see the analogy, but did not
like to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:--

"So you don't care about life and you don't want souls. Why not?" I put
my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.
The effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his
old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as
he replied:--

"I don't want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don't. I couldn't use them if
I had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn't eat them
or----" He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his
face, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. "And doctor, as to
life, what is it after all? When you've got all you require, and you
know that you will never want, that is all. I have friends--good
friends--like you, Dr. Seward"; this was said with a leer of
inexpressible cunning. "I know that I shall never lack the means of
life!"

I think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some
antagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as
he--a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present it
was useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so I came away.

Later in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have come
without special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him
that I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything
to help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues; and so are
Lord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the
record prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurate
knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wish
to be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him with
me to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he
might not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield
might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were
alone.

I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose
which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When I
came in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his
lips:--

"What about souls?" It was evident then that my surmise had been
correct. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the
lunatic. I determined to have the matter out. "What about them
yourself?" I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all round
him, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for
an answer.

"I don't want any souls!" he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The
matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it--to "be
cruel only to be kind." So I said:--

"You like life, and you want life?"

"Oh yes! but that is all right; you needn't worry about that!"

"But," I asked, "how are we to get the life without getting the soul
also?" This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:--

"A nice time you'll have some time when you're flying out there, with
the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing
and twittering and miauing all round you. You've got their lives, you
know, and you must put up with their souls!" Something seemed to affect
his imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,
screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being
soaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave
me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child--only a child,
though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. It
was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance,
and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign
to himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and
go with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him,
speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:--

"Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?" He seemed to
wake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied:--

"Not much! flies are poor things, after all!" After a pause he added,
"But I don't want their souls buzzing round me, all the same."

"Or spiders?" I went on.

"Blow spiders! What's the use of spiders? There isn't anything in them
to eat or"--he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden
topic.

"So, so!" I thought to myself, "this is the second time he has suddenly
stopped at the word 'drink'; what does it mean?" Renfield seemed himself
aware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract
my attention from it:--

"I don't take any stock at all in such matters. 'Rats and mice and such
small deer,' as Shakespeare has it, 'chicken-feed of the larder' they
might be called. I'm past all that sort of nonsense. You might as well
ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try to
interest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is before
me."

"I see," I said. "You want big things that you can make your teeth meet
in? How would you like to breakfast on elephant?"

"What ridiculous nonsense you are talking!" He was getting too wide
awake, so I thought I would press him hard. "I wonder," I said
reflectively, "what an elephant's soul is like!"

The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his
high-horse and became a child again.

"I don't want an elephant's soul, or any soul at all!" he said. For a
few moments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with
his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. "To
hell with you and your souls!" he shouted. "Why do you plague me about
souls? Haven't I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already,
without thinking of souls!" He looked so hostile that I thought he was
in for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant,
however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:--

"Forgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am so
worried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the
problem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and
tolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat. I
want to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I am
sure you will understand!" He had evidently self-control; so when the
attendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfield
watched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable
dignity and sweetness:--

"Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me that
I am very, very grateful to you!" I thought it well to leave him in this
mood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder over in
this man's state. Several points seem to make what the American
interviewer calls "a story," if one could only get them in proper order.
Here they are:--

Will not mention "drinking."

Fears the thought of being burdened with the "soul" of anything.

Has no dread of wanting "life" in the future.

Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads being
haunted by their souls.

Logically all these things point one way! he has assurance of some kind
that he will acquire some higher life. He dreads the consequence--the
burden of a soul. Then it is a human life he looks to!

And the assurance--?

Merciful God! the Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme of
terror afoot!

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my
suspicion. He grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over for a
while asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to the door
we heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time
which now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement that
he had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the
autumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. We tried to make him talk
of the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend. He
went on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. He had
got a scrap of paper and was folding it into a note-book. We had to come
away as ignorant as we went in.

His is a curious case indeed; we must watch him to-night.


_Letter, Mitchell, Sons and Candy to Lord Godalming._

_"1 October._

"My Lord,

"We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes. We beg, with
regard to the desire of your Lordship, expressed by Mr. Harker on your
behalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale and
purchase of No. 347, Piccadilly. The original vendors are the executors
of the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield. The purchaser is a foreign
nobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the
purchase money in notes 'over the counter,' if your Lordship will pardon
us using so vulgar an expression. Beyond this we know nothing whatever
of him.

"We are, my Lord,

"Your Lordship's humble servants,

"MITCHELL, SONS & CANDY."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_2 October._--I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him to
make an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield's room,
and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he
was to call me. After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire
in the study--Mrs. Harker having gone to bed--we discussed the attempts
and discoveries of the day. Harker was the only one who had any result,
and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one.

Before going to bed I went round to the patient's room and looked in
through the observation trap. He was sleeping soundly, and his heart
rose and fell with regular respiration.

This morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight
he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly. I asked him
if that was all; he replied that it was all he heard. There was
something about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank if
he had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having "dozed" for
a while. It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are
watched.

To-day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey are
looking after horses. Godalming thinks that it will be well to have
horses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we
seek there will be no time to lose. We must sterilise all the imported
earth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the Count at his
weakest, and without a refuge to fly to. Van Helsing is off to the
British Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine. The old
physicians took account of things which their followers do not accept,
and the Professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be
useful to us later.

I sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in
strait-waistcoats.

_Later._--We have met again. We seem at last to be on the track, and our
work of to-morrow may be the beginning of the end. I wonder if
Renfield's quiet has anything to do with this. His moods have so
followed the doings of the Count, that the coming destruction of the
monster may be carried to him in some subtle way. If we could only get
some hint as to what passed in his mind, between the time of my argument
with him to-day and his resumption of fly-catching, it might afford us a
valuable clue. He is now seemingly quiet for a spell.... Is he?---- That
wild yell seemed to come from his room....

       *       *       *       *       *

The attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield had
somehow met with some accident. He had heard him yell; and when he went
to him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with blood.
I must go at once....




CHAPTER XXI

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


_3 October._--Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as well
as I can remember it, since last I made an entry. Not a detail that I
can recall must be forgotten; in all calmness I must proceed.

When I came to Renfield's room I found him lying on the floor on his
left side in a glittering pool of blood. When I went to move him, it
became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries;
there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body
which marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see
that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the
floor--indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood
originated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as
we turned him over:--

"I think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg and
the whole side of his face are paralysed." How such a thing could have
happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite
bewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:--

"I can't understand the two things. He could mark his face like that by
beating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once at the
Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he
might have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward
kink. But for the life of me I can't imagine how the two things
occurred. If his back was broke, he couldn't beat his head; and if his
face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of
it." I said to him:--

"Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want
him without an instant's delay." The man ran off, and within a few
minutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When
he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and
then turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he
said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:--

"Ah, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and much
attention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself.
If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you."

The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that
he had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned with
extraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He had
evidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he
looked at the patient, he whispered to me:--

"Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomes
conscious, after the operation." So I said:--

"I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at
present. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate.
Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere."

The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.
The wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed
fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The
Professor thought a moment and said:--

"We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far
as can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of
his injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the
brain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be
too late." As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I
went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and
Quincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--

"I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.
So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things
are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us
these times. I've been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things
as they have been. We'll have to look back--and forward a little more
than we have done. May we come in?" I nodded, and held the door open
till they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the
attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the
floor, he said softly:--

"My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!" I told him
briefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after
the operation--for a short time, at all events. He went at once and sat
down on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched
in patience.

"We shall wait," said Van Helsing, "just long enough to fix the best
spot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove
the blood clot; for it is evident that the hmorrhage is increasing."

The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a
horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing's face I gathered
that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded
the words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think;
but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men
who have heard the death-watch. The poor man's breathing came in
uncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes
and speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he
would relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick
beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost
hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my
temples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became
agonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from
their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal
torture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead
some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect
it.

At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was
sinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor
and caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he
spoke:--

"There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I have
been thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake!
We shall operate just above the ear."

Without another word he made the operation. For a few moments the
breathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so
prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.
Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.
This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad
surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved
convulsively, and as he did so, said:--

"I'll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I
have had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot
move. What's wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts
dreadfully." He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his
eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van
Helsing said in a quiet grave tone:--

"Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield." As he heard the voice his face
brightened, through its mutilation, and he said:--

"That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some
water, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed"--he
stopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey--"The
brandy--it is in my study--quick!" He flew and returned with a glass,
the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parched
lips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor
injured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite
conscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I
shall never forget, and said:--

"I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality."
Then his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two
figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:--

"If I were not sure already, I would know from them." For an instant his
eyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were
bringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said,
hurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:--

"Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes;
and then I must go back to death--or worse! Wet my lips with brandy
again. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poor
crushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you left
me, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn't speak then, for I
felt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as
I am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left
me; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain
seemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard the
dogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!" As he spoke, Van
Helsing's eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and
gripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly
and said: "Go on," in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:--

"He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before;
but he was solid then--not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a
man's when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white
teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt
of trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn't ask him to come in
at first, though I knew he wanted to--just as he had wanted all along.
Then he began promising me things--not in words but by doing them." He
was interrupted by a word from the Professor:--

"How?"

"By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the
sun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their
wings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their
backs." Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:--

"The _Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges_--what you call the
'Death's-head Moth'?" The patient went on without stopping.

"Then he began to whisper: 'Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands,
millions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats
too. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely
buzzing flies!' I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do.
Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He
beckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his
hands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass
spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and
then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there
were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like His, only
smaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he
seemed to be saying: 'All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more
and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship
me!' And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close
over my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening
the sash and saying to Him: 'Come in, Lord and Master!' The rats were
all gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only
open an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in through
the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and
splendour."

His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and
he continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in
the interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call him
back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: "Let him go on. Do
not interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all
if once he lost the thread of his thought." He proceeded:--

"All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not
even a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him.
When he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even
knock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face looked
out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he
owned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn't even smell the same
as he went by me. I couldn't hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs.
Harker had come into the room."

The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind
him so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.
They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face,
however, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without
noticing:--

"When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn't the same;
it was like tea after the teapot had been watered." Here we all moved,
but no one said a word; he went on:--

"I didn't know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn't look the
same. I don't care for the pale people; I like them with lots of blood
in them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn't think of it
at the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad
to know that He had been taking the life out of her." I could feel that
the rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. "So when
He came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I
grabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and
as I knew I was a madman--at times anyhow--I resolved to use my power.
Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle
with me. I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn't
mean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burned
into me, and my strength became like water. He slipped through it, and
when I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There
was a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed
to steal away under the door." His voice was becoming fainter and his
breath more stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively.

"We know the worst now," he said. "He is here, and we know his purpose.
It may not be too late. Let us be armed--the same as we were the other
night, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare." There was no
need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words--we shared them in
common. We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we
had when we entered the Count's house. The Professor had his ready, and
as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:--

"They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is
over. Be wise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with.
Alas! alas! that that dear Madam Mina should suffer!" He stopped; his
voice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in
my own heart.

Outside the Harkers' door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and the
latter said:--

"Should we disturb her?"

"We must," said Van Helsing grimly. "If the door be locked, I shall
break it in."

"May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to break into a lady's
room!"

Van Helsing said solemnly, "You are always right; but this is life and
death. All chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not they
are all as one to me to-night. Friend John, when I turn the handle, if
the door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you
too, my friends. Now!"

He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We threw
ourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost fell
headlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I saw
across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I saw
appalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck,
and my heart seemed to stand still.

The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room
was light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan
Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.
Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad
figure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black.
His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised
the Count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left
hand he held both Mrs. Harker's hands, keeping them away with her arms
at full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck,
forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared
with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man's bare breast which
was shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible
resemblance to a child forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk to
compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his
face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap
into it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils
of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the
white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth,
champed together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw
his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned
and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet,
and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred
Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside
the tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we,
lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a
great black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up
under Quincey's match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we
looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting
open, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved
forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with
it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it
seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a
few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was
ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared
her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of
blood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her
poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the
Count's terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail
which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an
endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently
over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant
despairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:--

"Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We can
do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers
herself; I must wake him!" He dipped the end of a towel in cold water
and with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while
holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was
heart-breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out of the
window. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey
Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great
yew-tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the
instant I heard Harker's quick exclamation as he woke to partial
consciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might well
be, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and
then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he
started up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to
him with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly,
however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held
her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.

"In God's name what does this mean?" Harker cried out. "Dr. Seward, Dr.
Van Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear,
what is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come to
this!" and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly
together. "Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!" With a quick
movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,--all the
man in him awake at the need for instant exertion. "What has happened?
Tell me all about it!" he cried without pausing. "Dr. Van Helsing, you
love Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too
far yet. Guard her while I look for _him_!" His wife, through her terror
and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly
forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:--

"No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough
to-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must stay
with me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!" Her
expression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, she
pulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.

Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up his
little golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:--

"Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you no
foul thing can approach. You are safe for to-night; and we must be calm
and take counsel together." She shuddered and was silent, holding down
her head on her husband's breast. When she raised it, his white
night-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where
the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. The instant she
saw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking
sobs:--

"Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that it
should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have
most cause to fear." To this he spoke out resolutely:--

"Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not
hear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by my
deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour,
if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!" He put out
his arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there
sobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked
damply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After a
while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to
me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous
power to the utmost:--

"And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broad
fact; tell me all that has been." I told him exactly what had happened,
and he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched
and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had
held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to
the open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, to
see, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over
the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled
hair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.
They entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at me
questioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of
their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband
and wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence
to him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming
answered:--

"I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. I
looked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone. He had,
however----" He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on
the bed. Van Helsing said gravely:--

"Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope now
is in knowing all. Tell freely!" So Art went on:--

"He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few
seconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the manuscript had been
burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the
cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax
had helped the flames." Here I interrupted. "Thank God there is the
other copy in the safe!" His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he
went on: "I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. I looked
into Renfield's room; but there was no trace there except----!" Again he
paused. "Go on," said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head and
moistening his lips with his tongue, added: "except that the poor fellow
is dead." Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of
us she said solemnly:--

"God's will be done!" I could not but feel that Art was keeping back
something; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.
Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked:--

"And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?"

"A little," he answered. "It may be much eventually, but at present I
can't say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would
go when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise from
Renfield's window, and flap westward. I expected to see him in some
shape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair. He
will not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the
dawn is close. We must work to-morrow!"

He said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of perhaps
a couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could
hear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing his
hand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker's head:--

"And now, Madam Mina--poor, dear, dear Madam Mina--tell us exactly what
happened. God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it is
need that we know all. For now more than ever has all work to be done
quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that must
end all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live and
learn."

The poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves
as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and
lower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and held
out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and
kissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in that
of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.
After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she
began:--

"I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a
long time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads
of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of them
connected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble."
Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said
lovingly: "Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me
through the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me
to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I
need your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work
with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to
sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no
more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when
next I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I
had before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will find
it in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague
terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence.
I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it
seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I
tried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I
looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside
the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the mist
had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood a
tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of
the others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light
fell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white
teeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the
sunset on the windows of St. Mary's Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the
red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant
my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was
paralysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper,
pointing as he spoke to Jonathan:--

"'Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out
before your very eyes.' I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or
say anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder
and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did
so, 'First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as well
be quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have
appeased my thirst!' I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not
want to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that
such is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity
me! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!" Her husband groaned
again. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if
he were the injured one, and went on:--

"I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How long
this horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long time
must have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I
saw it drip with the fresh blood!" The remembrance seemed for a while to
overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her
husband's sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself and
went on:--

"Then he spoke to me mockingly, 'And so you, like the others, would play
your brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me and
frustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already,
and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. They
should have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst they
played wits against me--against me who commanded nations, and intrigued
for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were
born--I was countermining them. And you, their best beloved one, are now
to me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful
wine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and my
helper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall
minister to your needs. But as yet you are to be punished for what you
have done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my
call. When my brain says "Come!" to you, you shall cross land or sea to
do my bidding; and to that end this!' With that he pulled open his
shirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. When
the blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding
them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to
the wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the---- Oh
my God! my God! what have I done? What have I done to deserve such a
fate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my
days. God pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril;
and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!" Then she began to rub her
lips as though to cleanse them from pollution.

As she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken,
and everything became more and more clear. Harker was still and quiet;
but over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look
which deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first
red streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out
against the whitening hair.

We have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy
pair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action.

Of this I am sure: the sun rises to-day on no more miserable house in
all the great round of its daily course.




CHAPTER XXII

JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


_3 October._--As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. It
is now six o'clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and
take something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed
that if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God
knows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare
not stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end
the little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, could
not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day. However,
we must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears
running down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our
faith is tested--that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us
up to the end. The end! oh my God! what end?... To work! To work!

When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor
Renfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Seward
told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below
they had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was
all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.

Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had
heard anything. He said that he had been sitting down--he confessed to
half dozing--when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield
had called out loudly several times, "God! God! God!" after that there
was a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying
on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsing
asked if he had heard "voices" or "a voice," and he said he could not
say; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as
there was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear
to it, if required, that the word "God" was spoken by the patient. Dr.
Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into
the matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it
would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As
it was, he thought that on the attendant's evidence he could give a
certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case the
coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily
to the same result.

When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next
step, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full
confidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should be
kept from her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful
to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of
despair. "There must be no concealment," she said, "Alas! we have had
too much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can
give me more pain than I have already endured--than I suffer now!
Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!"
Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly
but quietly:--

"But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for
others from yourself, after what has happened?" Her face grew set in its
lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she
answered:--

"Ah no! for my mind is made up!"

"To what?" he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in
our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her answer
came with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:--

"Because if I find in myself--and I shall watch keenly for it--a sign of
harm to any that I love, I shall die!"

"You would not kill yourself?" he asked, hoarsely.

"I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such a
pain, and so desperate an effort!" She looked at him meaningly as she
spoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her and
put his hand on her head as he said solemnly:

"My child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For myself I
could hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you,
even at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But my
child----" For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his
throat; he gulped it down and went on:--

"There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must not
die. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. Until
the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not
die; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would make
you even as he is. No, you must live! You must struggle and strive to
live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death
himself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the
night; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that you
do not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be past." The
poor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a
quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were all
silent; we could do nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning to
him said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:--

"I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall
strive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may
have passed away from me." She was so good and brave that we all felt
that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we
began to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she was to have all
the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we
might hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before.
She was pleased with the prospect of anything to do--if "pleased" could
be used in connection with so grim an interest.

As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was
prepared with an exact ordering of our work.

"It is perhaps well," he said, "that at our meeting after our visit to
Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay
there. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and
would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an
effort with regard to the others; but now he does not know our
intentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a
power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot use
them as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as
to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in
Piccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours;
and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning
guards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster must
retain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitations
of his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear
through cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he
must open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt out
all his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catch
him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching
and the destroying shall be, in time, sure." Here I started up for I
could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so
preciously laden with Mina's life and happiness were flying from us,
since whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held up
his hand warningly. "Nay, friend Jonathan," he said, "in this, the
quickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall all
act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in
all probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly.
The Count may have many houses which he has bought. Of them he will have
deeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that he
write on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongings
that he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet,
where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the
very vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there and
search that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our
friend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt 'stop the earths' and so we
run down our old fox--so? is it not?"

"Then let us come at once," I cried, "we are wasting the precious,
precious time!" The Professor did not move, but simply said:--

"And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?"

"Any way!" I cried. "We shall break in if need be."

"And your police; where will they be, and what will they say?"

I was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good
reason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could:--

"Don't wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I am
in."

"Ah, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add to
your anguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at
movement. Then will come our time. I have thought and thought, and it
seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to get
into the house, but we have no key; is it not so?" I nodded.

"Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could
not still get it; and think there was to you no conscience of the
housebreaker, what would you do?"

"I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the
lock for me."

"And your police, they would interfere, would they not?"

"Oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed."

"Then," he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, "all that is in doubt is
the conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to
whether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Your
police must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!--in reading
the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my
friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this
your London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such
things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done,
no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine
house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland
and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and
got in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out
and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he
have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice;
and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of
that other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him
that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away
within a certain time. And your police and other authority help him all
they can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland
he find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done
_en rgle_; and in our work we shall be _en rgle_ too. We shall not go
so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem
it strange; but we shall go after ten o'clock, when there are many
about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the
house."

I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina's
face became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good counsel. Van
Helsing went on:--

"When once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some of
us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be
more earth-boxes--at Bermondsey and Mile End."

Lord Godalming stood up. "I can be of some use here," he said. "I shall
wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most
convenient."

"Look here, old fellow," said Morris, "it is a capital idea to have all
ready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don't you think that one
of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of
Walworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes?
It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; and
even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to."

"Friend Quincey is right!" said the Professor. "His head is what you
call in plane with the horizon. It is a difficult thing that we go to
do, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may."

Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see
that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the
terrible experience of the night. She was very, very pale--almost
ghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in
somewhat of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it should give
her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of
what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood. As
yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet
was short, and there was time for fear.

When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the
disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It was
finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the
Count's lair close at hand. In case he should find it out too soon, we
should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and his
presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us
some new clue.

As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that,
after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly;
that the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming
and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them.
It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count
might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be
able to cope with him then and there. At any rate, we might be able to
follow him in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as
my going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect
Mina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina would
not listen to my objection. She said that there might be some law matter
in which I could be useful; that amongst the Count's papers might be
some clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania;
and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to
cope with the Count's extraordinary power. I had to give in, for Mina's
resolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for _her_ that
we should all work together. "As for me," she said, "I have no fear.
Things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must
have in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, if
He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present." So I
started up crying out: "Then in God's name let us come at once, for we
are losing time. The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we
think."

"Not so!" said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.

"But why?" I asked.

"Do you forget," he said, with actually a smile, "that last night he
banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?"

Did I forget! shall I ever--can I ever! Can any of us ever forget that
terrible scene! Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; but
the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and
shuddered whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall her
frightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her and her part in
the affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said,
he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. "Oh,
Madam Mina," he said, "dear, dear Madam Mina, alas! that I of all who so
reverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid old
lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you will
forget it, will you not?" He bent low beside her as he spoke; she took
his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:--

"No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it I
have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all
together. Now, you must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready, and we
must all eat that we may be strong."

Breakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful and
encourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of
us. When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:--

"Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are we
all armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy's
lair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?" We all assured
him. "Then it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case _quite_ safe
here until the sunset; and before then we shall return--if---- We shall
return! But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack. I
have myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing
of things of which we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guard
yourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the
name of the Father, the Son, and----"

There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As he
had placed the Wafer on Mina's forehead, it had seared it--had burned
into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal. My poor
darling's brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as
her nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that
her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But the
words to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased
to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her
knees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hair
over her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:--

"Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must
bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day." They
all paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless
grief, and putting my arms around held her tight. For a few minutes our
sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away
their eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said
gravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some
way inspired, and was stating things outside himself:--

"It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit,
as He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all wrongs of
the earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, Madam
Mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that
red scar, the sign of God's knowledge of what has been, shall pass away,
and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely as
we live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the
burden that is hard upon us. Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did
in obedience to His Will. It may be that we are chosen instruments of
His good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that other
through stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and
fears, and all that makes the difference between God and man."

There was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation.
Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old
man's hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we all
knelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each
other. We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the
head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help
and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.

It was then time to start. So I said farewell to Mina, a parting which
neither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out.

To one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that Mina must be a
vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible
land alone. I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant
many; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so
the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.

We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on
the first occasion. It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic
surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such
fear as already we knew. Had not our minds been made up, and had there
not been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded
with our task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; and
in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last.
Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:--

"And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We must sterilise this
earth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far
distant land for such fell use. He has chosen this earth because it has
been holy. Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more
holy still. It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to
God." As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and
very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelled
musty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention
was concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the
Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down
the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.

One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left
them as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was a portion
of the Host.

When we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:--

"So much is already done. If it may be that with all the others we can
be so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on Madam
Mina's forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!"

As we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our
train we could see the front of the asylum. I looked eagerly, and in the
window of my own room saw Mina. I waved my hand to her, and nodded to
tell that our work there was successfully accomplished. She nodded in
reply to show that she understood. The last I saw, she was waving her
hand in farewell. It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station
and just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the
platform.

I have written this in the train.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Piccadilly, 12:30 o'clock._--Just before we reached Fenchurch Street
Lord Godalming said to me:--

"Quincey and I will find a locksmith. You had better not come with us in
case there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances it
wouldn't seem so bad for us to break into an empty house. But you are a
solicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you
should have known better." I demurred as to my not sharing any danger
even of odium, but he went on: "Besides, it will attract less attention
if there are not too many of us. My title will make it all right with
the locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. You had
better go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park,
somewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened and
the smith has gone away, do you all come across. We shall be on the
lookout for you, and shall let you in."

"The advice is good!" said Van Helsing, so we said no more. Godalming
and Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another. At the corner
of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green
Park. My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was
centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst
its more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. We sat down on a bench
within good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little
attention as possible. The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we
waited for the coming of the others.

At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurely
fashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box descended
a thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paid
the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. Together the two
ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done.
The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes
of the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered
along. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down
placed his bag beside him. After searching through it, he took out a
selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly
fashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and
turning to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, and
the man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he
began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling
about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once the
door opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others
entered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van
Helsing's went cold altogether. We waited patiently as we saw the
workman come out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partly
open, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock.
This he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and
gave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his
coat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole
transaction.

When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at
the door. It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood
Lord Godalming lighting a cigar.

"The place smells so vilely," said the latter as we came in. It did
indeed smell vilely--like the old chapel at Carfax--and with our
previous experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the
place pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping together
in case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal
with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the
house. In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found
eight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought!
Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the
missing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out
across a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable,
pointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were no
windows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. We did not
lose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we had
brought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had
treated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the
Count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for
any of his effects.

After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic,
we came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects
which might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine
them. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room
table. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle;
deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey;
note-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thin
wrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothes
brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin--the latter containing
dirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a
little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to
the other houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming
and Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the
houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great
bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of us
are, with what patience we can, waiting their return--or the coming of
the Count.




CHAPTER XXIII

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


_3 October._--The time seemed terrible long whilst we were waiting for
the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keep
our minds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficent
purpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker.
The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see.
Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful
face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. To-day he is a drawn,
haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning
eyes and grief-written lines of his face. His energy is still intact; in
fact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be his salvation, for, if
all go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then,
in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. Poor fellow, I
thought my own trouble was bad enough, but his----! The Professor knows
this well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. What he
has been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. So
well as I can remember, here it is:--

"I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all
the papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, the
greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through there
are signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of
it. As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth,
he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and
alchemist--which latter was the highest development of the
science-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond
compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even to
attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time
that he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived the
physical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete.
In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is
growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of
man's stature. He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not
been that we have crossed his path he would be yet--he may be yet if we
fail--the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must
lead through Death, not Life."

Harker groaned and said, "And this is all arrayed against my darling!
But how is he experimenting? The knowledge may help us to defeat him!"

"He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but
surely; that big child-brain of his is working. Well for us, it is, as
yet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain
things he would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he means
to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait
and to go slow. _Festina lente_ may well be his motto."

"I fail to understand," said Harker wearily. "Oh, do be more plain to
me! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain."

The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:--

"Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this
monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. How he has been
making use of the zophagous patient to effect his entry into friend
John's home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when
and how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by
an inmate. But these are not his most important experiments. Do we not
see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. He
knew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so great
child-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he
might not himself move the box. So he began to help; and then, when he
found that this be all-right, he try to move them all alone. And so he
progress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where
they are hidden. He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So
that he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his
form, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his
hiding-place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him
just too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him;
and before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where he
can move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be sure. Is
there not more at stake for us than for him? Then why we not be even
more careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be
well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us. To-day is our
day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there are
five of us when those absent ones return."

Whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, the
double postman's knock of the telegraph boy. We all moved out to the
hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to
keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. The boy handed in a
despatch. The Professor closed the door again, and, after looking at the
direction, opened it and read aloud.

"Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly and
hastened towards the South. He seems to be going the round and may want
to see you: Mina."

There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker's voice:--

"Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!" Van Helsing turned to him
quickly and said:--

"God will act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice
as yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings."

"I care for nothing now," he answered hotly, "except to wipe out this
brute from the face of creation. I would sell my soul to do it!"

"Oh, hush, hush, my child!" said Van Helsing. "God does not purchase
souls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keep
faith. But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your
devotion to that dear Madam Mina. Think you, how her pain would be
doubled, did she but hear your wild words. Do not fear any of us, we are
all devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end. The time is
coming for action; to-day this Vampire is limit to the powers of man,
and till sunset he may not change. It will take him time to arrive
here--see, it is twenty minutes past one--and there are yet some times
before he can hither come, be he never so quick. What we must hope for
is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first."

About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker's telegram, there
came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. It was just an ordinary
knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made
the Professor's heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, and
together moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various
armaments--the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. Van
Helsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood
back, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our hearts
must have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we
saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closed
the door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the
hall:--

"It is all right. We found both places; six boxes in each and we
destroyed them all!"

"Destroyed?" asked the Professor.

"For him!" We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:--

"There's nothing to do but to wait here. If, however, he doesn't turn up
by five o'clock, we must start off; for it won't do to leave Mrs. Harker
alone after sunset."

"He will be here before long now," said Van Helsing, who had been
consulting his pocket-book. "_Nota bene_, in Madam's telegram he went
south from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and he could
only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one
o'clock. That he went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet only
suspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would
suspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only a
short time before him. That he is not here already shows that he went to
Mile End next. This took him some time; for he would then have to be
carried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not
have long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so that
we may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all your
arms! Be ready!" He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could
hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.

I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a
dominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and
adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always
been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been
accustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be
renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once
laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a
gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were
just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could
guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.
Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to
move in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the
seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along
the hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise--at least
he feared it.

Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way past
us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was something
so panther-like in the movement--something so unhuman, that it seemed
to sober us all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was
Harker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door
leading into the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, a
horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth long
and pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of
lion-like disdain. His expression again changed as, with a single
impulse, we all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not some
better organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what
we were to do. I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would
avail us anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had
ready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. The
blow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count's
leap back saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne
through his heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat,
making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold
fell out. The expression of the Count's face was so hellish, that for a
moment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife
aloft again for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with a
protective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I
felt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I
saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously
by each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression of
hate and baffled malignity--of anger and hellish rage--which came over
the Count's face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast
of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the
pallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous
dive he swept under Harker's arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping
a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw
himself at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass,
he tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of the
shivering glass I could hear the "ting" of the gold, as some of the
sovereigns fell on the flagging.

We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up
the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.
There he turned and spoke to us:--

"You think to baffle me, you--with your pale faces all in a row, like
sheep in a butcher's. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you! You think
you have left me without a place to rest; but I have more. My revenge is
just begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. Your
girls that you all love are mine already; and through them you and
others shall yet be mine--my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my
jackals when I want to feed. Bah!" With a contemptuous sneer, he passed
quickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he
fastened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut. The first of us
to speak was the Professor, as, realising the difficulty of following
him through the stable, we moved toward the hall.

"We have learnt something--much! Notwithstanding his brave words, he
fears us; he fear time, he fear want! For if not, why he hurry so? His
very tone betray him, or my ears deceive. Why take that money? You
follow quick. You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so. For
me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he
return." As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket; took
the title-deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the
remaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with
a match.

Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had
lowered himself from the window to follow the Count. He had, however,
bolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open there
was no sign of him. Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back
of the house; but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.

It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. We had to
recognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with the
Professor when he said:--

"Let us go back to Madam Mina--poor, poor dear Madam Mina. All we can do
just now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. But we need
not despair. There is but one more earth-box, and we must try to find
it; when that is done all may yet be well." I could see that he spoke as
bravely as he could to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken
down; now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress--he
was thinking of his wife.

With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker
waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her
bravery and unselfishness. When she saw our faces, her own became as
pale as death: for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were
in secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:--

"I can never thank you all enough. Oh, my poor darling!" As she spoke,
she took her husband's grey head in her hands and kissed it--"Lay your
poor head here and rest it. All will yet be well, dear! God will protect
us if He so will it in His good intent." The poor fellow groaned. There
was no place for words in his sublime misery.

We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us
all up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry
people--for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast--or the sense
of companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less
miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True to
our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; and
although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to
threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was
manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. When we came to the
part where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung to
her husband's arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could
protect him from any harm that might come. She said nothing, however,
till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up
to the present time. Then without letting go her husband's hand she
stood up amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of the
scene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty
of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which
she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our
teeth--remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against
our grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and
we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and
purity and faith, was outcast from God.

"Jonathan," she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it was
so full of love and tenderness, "Jonathan dear, and you all my true,
true friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all this
dreadful time. I know that you must fight--that you must destroy even as
you destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter;
but it is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought all this
misery is the saddest case of all. Just think what will be his joy when
he, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have
spiritual immortality. You must be pitiful to him, too, though it may
not hold your hands from his destruction."

As she spoke I could see her husband's face darken and draw together, as
though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core.
Instinctively the clasp on his wife's hand grew closer, till his
knuckles looked white. She did not flinch from the pain which I knew she
must have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing
than ever. As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing
his hand from hers as he spoke:--

"May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that
earthly life of him which we are aiming at. If beyond it I could send
his soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it!"

"Oh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good God. Don't say such things,
Jonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and horror. Just
think, my dear--I have been thinking all this long, long day of it--that
... perhaps ... some day ... I, too, may need such pity; and that some
other like you--and with equal cause for anger--may deny it to me! Oh,
my husband! my husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thought
had there been another way; but I pray that God may not have treasured
your wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving and
sorely stricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence
of what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom
so many sorrows have come."

We men were all in tears now. There was no resisting them, and we wept
openly. She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed.
Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms
round her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. Van Helsing beckoned
to us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone
with their God.

Before they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any coming
of the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace.
She tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for her
husband's sake, tried to seem content. It was a brave struggle; and was,
I think and believe, not without its reward. Van Helsing had placed at
hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.
When they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we should
sit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the
poor stricken lady. The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us
shall be off to bed as soon as we can. Godalming has already turned in,
for his is the second watch. Now that my work is done I, too, shall go
to bed.


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_3-4 October, close to midnight._--I thought yesterday would never end.
There was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief
that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must
now be for the better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next step
was to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew was that one
earth-box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was. If he
chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years; and in the
meantime!--the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now.
This I know: that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection, that
one is my poor wronged darling. I love her a thousand times more for her
sweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the monster
seem despicable. Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer
by the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are all drifting
reefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. Thank God! Mina is
sleeping, and sleeping without dreams. I fear what her dreams might be
like, with such terrible memories to ground them in. She has not been so
calm, within my seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a while, there came
over her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March.
I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her
face, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning. I am not sleepy
myself, though I am weary--weary to death. However, I must try to sleep;
for there is to-morrow to think of, and there is no rest for me
until....

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--I must have fallen asleep, for I was awaked by Mina, who was
sitting up in bed, with a startled look on her face. I could see easily,
for we did not leave the room in darkness; she had placed a warning hand
over my mouth, and now she whispered in my ear:--

"Hush! there is someone in the corridor!" I got up softly, and crossing
the room, gently opened the door.

Just outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake. He
raised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me:--

"Hush! go back to bed; it is all right. One of us will be here all
night. We don't mean to take any chances!"

His look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back and told Mina.
She sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor, pale
face as she put her arms round me and said softly:--

"Oh, thank God for good brave men!" With a sigh she sank back again to
sleep. I write this now as I am not sleepy, though I must try again.

       *       *       *       *       *

_4 October, morning._--Once again during the night I was wakened by
Mina. This time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the coming
dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was
like a speck rather than a disc of light. She said to me hurriedly:--

"Go, call the Professor. I want to see him at once."

"Why?" I asked.

"I have an idea. I suppose it must have come in the night, and matured
without my knowing it. He must hypnotise me before the dawn, and then I
shall be able to speak. Go quick, dearest; the time is getting close." I
went to the door. Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and, seeing
me, he sprang to his feet.

"Is anything wrong?" he asked, in alarm.

"No," I replied; "but Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once."

"I will go," he said, and hurried into the Professor's room.

In two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his
dressing-gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward at
the door asking questions. When the Professor saw Mina a smile--a
positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; he rubbed his hands as he
said:--

"Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change. See! friend Jonathan,
we have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us to-day!" Then
turning to her, he said, cheerfully: "And what am I do for you? For at
this hour you do not want me for nothings."

"I want you to hypnotise me!" she said. "Do it before the dawn, for I
feel that then I can speak, and speak freely. Be quick, for the time is
short!" Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.

Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her,
from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. Mina
gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat
like a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually
her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving of
her bosom could one know that she was alive. The Professor made a few
more passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead was
covered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened her eyes; but she
did not seem the same woman. There was a far-away look in her eyes, and
her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand to
impose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in.
They came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the
foot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not to see them. The
stillness was broken by Van Helsing's voice speaking in a low level tone
which would not break the current of her thoughts:--

"Where are you?" The answer came in a neutral way:--

"I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own." For several
minutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood
staring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room
was growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina's face, Dr. Van
Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the day seemed
just upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse
itself through the room. On the instant the Professor spoke again:--

"Where are you now?" The answer came dreamily, but with intention; it
were as though she were interpreting something. I have heard her use the
same tone when reading her shorthand notes.

"I do not know. It is all strange to me!"

"What do you see?"

"I can see nothing; it is all dark."

"What do you hear?" I could detect the strain in the Professor's patient
voice.

"The lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and little waves leap. I can
hear them on the outside."

"Then you are on a ship?" We all looked at each other, trying to glean
something each from the other. We were afraid to think. The answer came
quick:--

"Oh, yes!"

"What else do you hear?"

"The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. There is the
creaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan
falls into the rachet."

"What are you doing?"

"I am still--oh, so still. It is like death!" The voice faded away into
a deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again.

By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of
day. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina's shoulders, and laid her
head down softly on her pillow. She lay like a sleeping child for a few
moments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see
us all around her. "Have I been talking in my sleep?" was all she said.
She seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though she
was eager to know what she had told. The Professor repeated the
conversation, and she said:--

"Then there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!" Mr.
Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor's calm
voice called them back:--

"Stay, my friends. That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor
whilst she spoke. There are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in
your so great Port of London. Which of them is it that you seek? God be
thanked that we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us we
know not. We have been blind somewhat; blind after the manner of men,
since when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking
forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! Alas, but
that sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in the
Count's mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan's so fierce
knife put him in the danger that even he dread. He meant escape. Hear
me, ESCAPE! He saw that with but one earth-box left, and a pack of men
following like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him. He
have take his last earth-box on board a ship, and he leave the land. He
think to escape, but no! we follow him. Tally Ho! as friend Arthur would
say when he put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, and
we must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a
little while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are waters
between us which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if he
would--unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or
slack tide. See, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is to
us. Let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need,
and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with
us." Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked:--

"But why need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?" He
took her hand and patted it as he replied:--

"Ask me nothings as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer all
questions." He would say no more, and we separated to dress.

After breakfast Mina repeated her question. He looked at her gravely for
a minute and then said sorrowfully:--

"Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we find him
even if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!" She grew paler as
she asked faintly:--

"Why?"

"Because," he answered solemnly, "he can live for centuries, and you are
but mortal woman. Time is now to be dreaded--since once he put that mark
upon your throat."

I was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint.




CHAPTER XXIV

DR. SEWARD'S PHONOGRAPH DIARY, SPOKEN BY VAN HELSING


This to Jonathan Harker.

You are to stay with your dear Madam Mina. We shall go to make our
search--if I can call it so, for it is not search but knowing, and we
seek confirmation only. But do you stay and take care of her to-day.
This is your best and most holiest office. This day nothing can find him
here. Let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already,
for I have tell them. He, our enemy, have gone away; he have gone back
to his Castle in Transylvania. I know it so well, as if a great hand of
fire wrote it on the wall. He have prepare for this in some way, and
that last earth-box was ready to ship somewheres. For this he took the
money; for this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sun
go down. It was his last hope, save that he might hide in the tomb that
he think poor Miss Lucy, being as he thought like him, keep open to him.
But there was not of time. When that fail he make straight for his last
resource--his last earth-work I might say did I wish _double entente_.
He is clever, oh, so clever! he know that his game here was finish; and
so he decide he go back home. He find ship going by the route he came,
and he go in it. We go off now to find what ship, and whither bound;
when we have discover that, we come back and tell you all. Then we will
comfort you and poor dear Madam Mina with new hope. For it will be hope
when you think it over: that all is not lost. This very creature that we
pursue, he take hundreds of years to get so far as London; and yet in
one day, when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out. He is
finite, though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do.
But we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strong
together. Take heart afresh, dear husband of Madam Mina. This battle is
but begun, and in the end we shall win--so sure as that God sits on high
to watch over His children. Therefore be of much comfort till we return.

VAN HELSING.


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_4 October._--When I read to Mina, Van Helsing's message in the
phonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably. Already the
certainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort;
and comfort is strength to her. For my own part, now that his horrible
danger is not face to face with us, it seems almost impossible to
believe in it. Even my own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula seem
like a long-forgotten dream. Here in the crisp autumn air in the bright
sunlight----

Alas! how can I disbelieve! In the midst of my thought my eye fell on
the red scar on my poor darling's white forehead. Whilst that lasts,
there can be no disbelief. And afterwards the very memory of it will
keep faith crystal clear. Mina and I fear to be idle, so we have been
over all the diaries again and again. Somehow, although the reality
seems greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less. There is
something of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting.
Mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good. It may
be! I shall try to think as she does. We have never spoken to each other
yet of the future. It is better to wait till we see the Professor and
the others after their investigations.

The day is running by more quickly than I ever thought a day could run
for me again. It is now three o'clock.


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_5 October, 5 p. m._--Our meeting for report. Present: Professor Van
Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan
Harker, Mina Harker.

Dr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to
discover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape:--

"As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that
he must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since
by that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. _Omne
ignotum pro magnifico_; and so with heavy hearts we start to find what
ships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, since
Madam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important as to go in
your list of the shipping in the _Times_, and so we go, by suggestion of
Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd's, where are note of all ships that sail,
however so small. There we find that only one Black-Sea-bound ship go
out with the tide. She is the _Czarina Catherine_, and she sail from
Doolittle's Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up the
Danube. 'Soh!' said I, 'this is the ship whereon is the Count.' So off
we go to Doolittle's Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of wood
so small that the man look bigger than the office. From him we inquire
of the goings of the _Czarina Catherine_. He swear much, and he red face
and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when Quincey
give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and
put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he
still better fellow and humble servant to us. He come with us, and ask
many men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they
have been no more thirsty. They say much of blood and bloom, and of
others which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean; but
nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.

"They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five
o'clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose
and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That he be all in
black, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the
time. That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship
sails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the office and
then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of
gang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him. The captain come, when
told that he will be pay well; and though he swear much at the first he
agree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse
and cart can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himself
driving cart on which a great box; this he himself lift down, though it
take several to put it on truck for the ship. He give much talk to
captain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain like
it not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like he
can come and see where it shall be. But he say 'no'; that he come not
yet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that he
had better be quick--with blood--for that his ship will leave the
place--of blood--before the turn of the tide--with blood. Then the thin
man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but he
will be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again,
polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he
will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the
sailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell
him that he doesn't want no Frenchmen--with bloom upon them and also
with blood--in his ship--with blood on her also. And so, after asking
where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship
forms, he departed.

"No one knew where he went 'or bloomin' well cared,' as they said, for
they had something else to think of--well with blood again; for it soon
became apparent to all that the _Czarina Catherine_ would not sail as
was expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew,
and grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her.
The captain swore polyglot--very polyglot--polyglot with bloom and
blood; but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose; and he began to
fear that he would lose the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood,
when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and
asked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the captain replied
that he wished that he and his box--old and with much bloom and
blood--were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went down
with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile
on deck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him.
Indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and
all was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that was
of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain's swears
exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of
picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up
and down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any
of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the ship
went out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the
river mouth. She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.

"And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for
our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the
Danube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when
we start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hope
is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then
he can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. There
are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all about
where he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us
invoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in
Varna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present
his credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part.
When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and
have inquiry made at Varna, we say 'no'; for what is to be done is not
for police or of the customs. It must be done by us alone and in our own
way."

When Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certain
that the Count had remained on board the ship. He replied: "We have the
best proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this
morning." I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should
pursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that
he would surely go if the others went. He answered in growing passion,
at first quietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more
forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some
of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst
men:--

"Yes, it is necessary--necessary--necessary! For your sake in the first,
and then for the sake of humanity. This monster has done much harm
already, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short
time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in
darkness and not knowing. All this have I told these others; you, my
dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or
in that of your husband. I have told them how the measure of leaving his
own barren land--barren of peoples--and coming to a new land where life
of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the
work of centuries. Were another of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to do
what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have
been, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces of
nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in
some wondrous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead for
all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical
world. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.
There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters
of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless,
there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of
occult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in
himself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warlike
time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain,
more braver heart, than any man. In him some vital principle have in
strange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and
thrive, so his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which
is surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from,
and are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He have
infect you--oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is for
good of you that I speak. He infect you in such wise, that even if he do
no more, you have only to live--to live in your own old, sweet way; and
so in time, death, which is of man's common lot and with God's sanction,
shall make you like to him. This must not be! We have sworn together
that it must not. Thus are we ministers of God's own wish: that the
world, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters,
whose very existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem one
soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem
more. Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if
we fall, we fall in good cause." He paused and I said:--

"But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven
from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from
which he has been hunted?"

"Aha!" he said, "your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall
adopt him. Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has once
tasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl
unceasing till he get him. This that we hunt from our village is a
tiger, too, a man-eater, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself he
is not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he go
over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he be
beaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and again.
Look at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was to
him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What
does he do? He find out the place of all the world most of promise for
him. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. He
find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. He
study new tongues. He learn new social life; new environment of old
ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new
land and a new people who have come to be since he was. His glimpse that
he have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire. Nay, it help
him to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right he was at
the first in his surmises. He have done this alone; all alone! from a
ruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greater
world of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death, as we know
him; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole
peoples. Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil,
what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours. But we
are pledged to set the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and our
efforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not
even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest
strength. It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weapons
to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls
for the safety of one we love--for the good of mankind, and for the
honour and glory of God."

After a general discussion it was determined that for to-night nothing
be definitely settled; that we should all sleep on the facts, and try to
think out the proper conclusions. To-morrow, at breakfast, we are to
meet again, and, after making our conclusions known to one another, we
shall decide on some definite cause of action.

       *       *       *       *       *

I feel a wonderful peace and rest to-night. It is as if some haunting
presence were removed from me. Perhaps ...

My surmise was not finished, could not be; for I caught sight in the
mirror of the red mark upon my forehead; and I knew that I was still
unclean.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_5 October._--We all rose early, and I think that sleep did much for
each and all of us. When we met at early breakfast there was more
general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience
again.

It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let
any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way--even by
death--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More
than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether
the whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I
caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker's forehead that I was
brought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the
matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our
trouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her
trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something
recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to
meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of
action. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct
rather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear
that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker's tongue is tied. I _know_
that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can
guess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or
cannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and
he and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of
that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The
Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called "the
Vampire's baptism of blood." Well, there may be a poison that distils
itself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is
a mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if my
instinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker's silences, then there is a
terrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in the work before us. The same
power that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not think
further; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!

Van Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others. I shall
try to open the subject with him.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of
things. I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to
say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating
about the bush a little, he said suddenly:--

"Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just
at the first at any rate. Later, we may have to take the others into our
confidence"; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:--

"Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing." A cold shiver ran
through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsing
continued:--

"With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned
before things go too far. Our task is now in reality more difficult than
ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. I
can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is now
but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice
without to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes
are more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence now
often; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she
wrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. If
it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and
hear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who
have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he
will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?" I nodded
acquiescence; he went on:--

"Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of
our intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. This is a painful
task! Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but it must be.
When to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not
to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by
us." He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration
at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor
soul already so tortured. I knew that it would be some sort of comfort
to him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for at
any rate it would take away the pain of doubt. I told him, and the
effect was as I expected.

It is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing has
gone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. I
really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was
experienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent a
message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as
she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements
without her presence to embarrass us. The Professor and I looked at each
other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. For my own
part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it was
much pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances we
agreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to
preserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to
confer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. Van
Helsing roughly put the facts before us first:--

"The _Czarina Catherine_ left the Thames yesterday morning. It will take
her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to
reach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days.
Now, if we allow for two days less for the ship's voyage, owing to such
weather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear; and if
we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,
then we have a margin of nearly two weeks. Thus, in order to be quite
safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. Then we shall at any rate
be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such
preparations as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed--armed
against evil things, spiritual as well as physical." Here Quincey Morris
added:--

"I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be
that he shall get there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters to
our armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any
trouble of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack
after us at Tobolsk? What wouldn't we have given then for a repeater
apiece!"

"Good!" said Van Helsing, "Winchesters it shall be. Quincey's head is
level at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more
dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime we
can do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of
us, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there.
To-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we
four can set out on our journey."

"We four?" said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of
us.

"Of course!" answered the Professor quickly, "you must remain to take
care of your so sweet wife!" Harker was silent for awhile and then said
in a hollow voice:--

"Let us talk of that part of it in the morning. I want to consult with
Mina." I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not
to disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice. I looked at him
significantly and coughed. For answer he put his finger on his lips and
turned away.


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_5 October, afternoon._--For some time after our meeting this morning I
could not think. The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of
wonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina's determination not
to take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could not
argue the matter with her, I could only guess. I am as far as ever from
a solution now. The way the others received it, too, puzzled me; the
last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no
more concealment of anything amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmly
and sweetly like a little child. Her lips are curved and her face beams
with happiness. Thank God, there are such moments still for her.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina's happy sleep, and
came as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be. As the
evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking
lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All at
once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said:--

"Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. A
promise made to me, but made holily in God's hearing, and not to be
broken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter
tears. Quick, you must make it to me at once."

"Mina," I said, "a promise like that, I cannot make at once. I may have
no right to make it."

"But, dear one," she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes
were like pole stars, "it is I who wish it; and it is not for myself.
You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you may
do as you will. Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved
from the promise."

"I promise!" I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; though
to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead.
She said:--

"Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for
the campaign against the Count. Not by word, or inference, or
implication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!" and she
solemnly pointed to the scar. I saw that she was in earnest, and said
solemnly:--

"I promise!" and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had
been shut between us.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later, midnight._--Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening.
So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected
somewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pall
of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We all retired
early. Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it is a wonderful thing
that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible
trouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care.
Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to-night. I shall
try it. Oh! for a dreamless sleep.

       *       *       *       *       *

_6 October, morning._--Another surprise. Mina woke me early, about the
same time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing. I thought
that it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went
for the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I found
him dressed in his room. His door was ajar, so that he could hear the
opening of the door of our room. He came at once; as he passed into the
room, he asked Mina if the others might come, too.

"No," she said quite simply, "it will not be necessary. You can tell
them just as well. I must go with you on your journey."

Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a moment's pause he
asked:--

"But why?"

"You must take me with you. I am safer with you, and you shall be safer,
too."

"But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our solemnest
duty. We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than
any of us from--from circumstances--things that have been." He paused,
embarrassed.

As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:--

"I know. That is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun is
coming up; I may not be able again. I know that when the Count wills me
I must go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come by
wile; by any device to hoodwink--even Jonathan." God saw the look that
she turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angel
that look is noted to her everlasting honour. I could only clasp her
hand. I could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief of
tears. She went on:--

"You men are brave and strong. You are strong in your numbers, for you
can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had
to guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise me
and so learn that which even I myself do not know." Dr. Van Helsing said
very gravely:--

"Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise. You shall with us come; and
together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve." When he had
spoken, Mina's long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallen
back on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled up
the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room. Van Helsing
motioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and within
a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also.
He told them what Mina had said, and went on:--

"In the morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal with a
new factor: Madam Mina. Oh, but her soul is true. It is to her an agony
to tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we are
warned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be
ready to act the instant when that ship arrives."

"What shall we do exactly?" asked Mr. Morris laconically. The Professor
paused before replying:--

"We shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identified
the box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it. This we shall
fasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says the
superstition. And to superstition must we trust at the first; it was
man's faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still. Then,
when we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we
shall open the box, and--and all will be well."

"I shall not wait for any opportunity," said Morris. "When I see the box
I shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand
men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!" I
grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel.
I think he understood my look; I hope he did.

"Good boy," said Dr. Van Helsing. "Brave boy. Quincey is all man. God
bless him for it. My child, believe me none of us shall lag behind or
pause from any fear. I do but say what we may do--what we must do. But,
indeed, indeed we cannot say what we shall do. There are so many things
which may happen, and their ways and their ends are so various that
until the moment we may not say. We shall all be armed, in all ways; and
when the time for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack. Now
let us to-day put all our affairs in order. Let all things which touch
on others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of us
can tell what, or when, or how, the end may be. As for me, my own
affairs are regulate; and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go make
arrangements for the travel. I shall have all tickets and so forth for
our journey."

There was nothing further to be said, and we parted. I shall now settle
up all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come....

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--It is all done; my will is made, and all complete. Mina if she
survive is my sole heir. If it should not be so, then the others who
have been so good to us shall have remainder.

It is now drawing towards the sunset; Mina's uneasiness calls my
attention to it. I am sure that there is something on her mind which the
time of exact sunset will reveal. These occasions are becoming harrowing
times for us all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new
danger--some new pain, which, however, may in God's will be means to a
good end. I write all these things in the diary since my darling must
not hear them now; but if it may be that she can see them again, they
shall be ready.

She is calling to me.




CHAPTER XXV

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


_11 October, Evening._--Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he
says he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept.

I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs.
Harker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come to
understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom;
when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing
or restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or condition
begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts
till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with
the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of
negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute
freedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the
change-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of
warning silence.

To-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the
signs of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making a
violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very few
minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning
her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining,
she made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking her husband's hand
in hers began:--

"We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I know,
dear; I know that you will always be with me to the end." This was to
her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. "In
the morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be in
store for any of us. You are going to be so good to me as to take me
with you. I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak
woman, whose soul perhaps is lost--no, no, not yet, but is at any rate
at stake--you will do. But you must remember that I am not as you are.
There is a poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; which
must destroy me, unless some relief comes to us. Oh, my friends, you
know as well as I do, that my soul is at stake; and though I know there
is one way out for me, you must not and I must not take it!" She looked
appealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband.

"What is that way?" asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice. "What is that
way, which we must not--may not--take?"

"That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before
the greater evil is entirely wrought. I know, and you know, that were I
once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you
did my poor Lucy's. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing
that stood in the way I would not shrink to die here, now, amidst the
friends who love me. But death is not all. I cannot believe that to die
in such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be
done, is God's will. Therefore, I, on my part, give up here the
certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the
blackest things that the world or the nether world holds!" We were all
silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. The
faces of the others were set and Harker's grew ashen grey; perhaps he
guessed better than any of us what was coming. She continued:--

"This is what I can give into the hotch-pot." I could not but note the
quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all
seriousness. "What will each of you give? Your lives I know," she went
on quickly, "that is easy for brave men. Your lives are God's, and you
can give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?" She looked
again questioningly, but this time avoided her husband's face. Quincey
seemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. "Then I shall tell
you plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this
connection between us now. You must promise me, one and all--even you,
my beloved husband--that, should the time come, you will kill me."

"What is that time?" The voice was Quincey's, but it was low and
strained.

"When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that
I die that I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will,
without a moment's delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head;
or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!"

Quincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before her
and taking her hand in his said solemnly:--

"I'm only a rough fellow, who hasn't, perhaps, lived as a man should to
win such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred and
dear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the duty
that you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I shall make all
certain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has
come!"

"My true friend!" was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as,
bending over, she kissed his hand.

"I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!" said Van Helsing.

"And I!" said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to
take the oath. I followed, myself. Then her husband turned to her
wan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of
his hair, and asked:--

"And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?"

"You too, my dearest," she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her
voice and eyes. "You must not shrink. You are nearest and dearest and
all the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all
time. Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed
their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the
hands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the more because
those that they loved implored them to slay them. It is men's duty
towards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial! And oh, my
dear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it be at
the hand of him that loves me best. Dr. Van Helsing, I have not
forgotten your mercy in poor Lucy's case to him who loved"--she stopped
with a flying blush, and changed her phrase--"to him who had best right
to give her peace. If that time shall come again, I look to you to make
it a happy memory of my husband's life that it was his loving hand which
set me free from the awful thrall upon me."

"Again I swear!" came the Professor's resonant voice. Mrs. Harker
smiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and
said:--

"And now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget:
this time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in
such case you must lose no time in using your opportunity. At such a
time I myself might be--nay! if the time ever comes, _shall be_--leagued
with your enemy against you."

"One more request;" she became very solemn as she said this, "it is not
vital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing for
me, if you will." We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there was no need
to speak:--

"I want you to read the Burial Service." She was interrupted by a deep
groan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over her
heart, and continued: "You must read it over me some day. Whatever may
be the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweet
thought to all or some of us. You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for
then it will be in your voice in my memory for ever--come what may!"

"But oh, my dear one," he pleaded, "death is afar off from you."

"Nay," she said, holding up a warning hand. "I am deeper in death at
this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!"

"Oh, my wife, must I read it?" he said, before he began.

"It would comfort me, my husband!" was all she said; and he began to
read when she had got the book ready.

"How can I--how could any one--tell of that strange scene, its
solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its
sweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter
truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart
had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling
round that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of
her husband's voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often he
had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial
of the Dead. I--I cannot go on--words--and--v-voice--f-fail m-me!"

       *       *       *       *       *

She was right in her instinct. Strange as it all was, bizarre as it may
hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, it
comforted us much; and the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker's coming
relapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any
of us as we had dreaded.


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_15 October, Varna._--We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th,
got to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in the
Orient Express. We travelled night and day, arriving here at about five
o'clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had
arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel--"the
Odessus." The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eager
to get on, to care for them. Until the _Czarina Catherine_ comes into
port there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world.
Thank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour is
coming back. She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she slept
nearly all the time. Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very
wakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to
hypnotise her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and he
had to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by
habit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power at
these particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. He
always asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the first:--

"Nothing; all is dark." And to the second:--

"I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing
by. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. The wind is
high--I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam."
It is evident that the _Czarina Catherine_ is still at sea, hastening on
her way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just returned. He had four
telegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect:
that the _Czarina Catherine_ had not been reported to Lloyd's from
anywhere. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should
send him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. He
was to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might be
sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire.

We had dinner and went to bed early. To-morrow we are to see the
Vice-Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship
as soon as she arrives. Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get
on the boat between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he takes the
form of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and
so cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to man's form without
suspicion--which he evidently wishes to avoid--he must remain in the
box. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy;
for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy,
before he wakes. What mercy he shall get from us will not count for
much. We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the
seamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything,
and we are well supplied with money. We have only to make sure that the
ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being
warned, and we shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I
think!

       *       *       *       *       *

_16 October._--Mina's report still the same: lapping waves and rushing
water, darkness and favouring winds. We are evidently in good time, and
when we hear of the _Czarina Catherine_ we shall be ready. As she must
pass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.

       *       *       *       *       *

_17 October._--Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome
the Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the shippers that
he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from
a friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his own
risk. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every
facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a
similar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who
was much impressed with Godalming's kindly manner to him, and we are all
satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. We
have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If the
Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and
drive a stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall
prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall
have ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count's body,
it will soon after fall into dust. In such case there would be no
evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. But
even if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps
some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and
a rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it
were to come. We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our
intent. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the
_Czarina Catherine_ is seen, we are to be informed by a special
messenger.

       *       *       *       *       *

_24 October._--A whole week of waiting. Daily telegrams to Godalming,
but only the same story: "Not yet reported." Mina's morning and evening
hypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking
masts.

_Telegram, October 24th._

_Rufus Smith, Lloyd's, London, to Lord Godalming, care of H. B. M.
Vice-Consul, Varna._

"_Czarina Catherine_ reported this morning from Dardanelles."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_25 October._--How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen is
irksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild with
excitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd's. I
know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs.
Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After
all, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not to
let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any
excitement when we were in her presence. In old days she would, I am
sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but
in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. The
lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is
getting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. We
talk of her often; we have not, however, said a word to the others. It
would break poor Harker's heart--certainly his nerve--if he knew that we
had even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me,
her teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for
he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active
danger of a change in her. If this change should come, it would be
necessary to take steps!... We both know what those steps would have to
be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. We should
neither of us shrink from the task--awful though it be to contemplate.
"Euthanasia" is an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to
whoever invented it.

It is only about 24 hours' sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the
rate the _Czarina Catherine_ has come from London. She should therefore
arrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get in
before then, we are all about to retire early. We shall get up at one
o'clock, so as to be ready.

       *       *       *       *       *

_25 October, Noon_.--No news yet of the ship's arrival. Mrs. Harker's
hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible
that we may get news at any moment. We men are all in a fever of
excitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, and
an hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife
which he now always carries with him. It will be a bad lookout for the
Count if the edge of that "Kukri" ever touches his throat, driven by
that stern, ice-cold hand!

Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker to-day. About
noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like; although we
kept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it. She
had been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know
that she was sleeping. When, however, her husband mentioned casually
that she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, we went to
her room to see for ourselves. She was breathing naturally and looked so
well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than
anything else. Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonder
that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep
of some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she had
been for days. At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report. Wherever he
may be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination. To
his doom, I trust!

       *       *       *       *       *

_26 October._--Another day and no tidings of the _Czarina Catherine_.
She ought to be here by now. That she is still journeying _somewhere_ is
apparent, for Mrs. Harker's hypnotic report at sunrise was still the
same. It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog;
some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog
both to north and south of the port. We must continue our watching, as
the ship may now be signalled any moment.

       *       *       *       *       *

_27 October, Noon._--Most strange; no news yet of the ship we wait for.
Mrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual: "lapping
waves and rushing water," though she added that "the waves were very
faint." The telegrams from London have been the same: "no further
report." Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he
fears the Count is escaping us. He added significantly:--

"I did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina's. Souls and memories can do
strange things during trance." I was about to ask him more, but Harker
just then came in, and he held up a warning hand. We must try to-night
at sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.

       *       *       *       *       *

     _28 October._--Telegram. _Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming,
     care H. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna._

     "_Czarina Catherine_ reported entering Galatz at one o'clock
     to-day."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_28 October._--When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I
do not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been
expected. True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would
come; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen.
The delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things
would not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the
change would occur. None the less, however, was it a surprise. I suppose
that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against
ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know
that they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if
it be a will-o'-the-wisp to man. It was an odd experience and we all
took it differently. Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a
moment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said not a
word, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. Lord
Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. I was myself half
stunned and looked in wonder at one after another. Quincey Morris
tightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in our
old wandering days it meant "action." Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so
that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands
meekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled--actually smiled--the
dark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his
action belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of
the great Kukri knife and rested there. "When does the next train start
for Galatz?" said Van Helsing to us generally.

"At 6:30 to-morrow morning!" We all started, for the answer came from
Mrs. Harker.

"How on earth do you know?" said Art.

"You forget--or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so
does Dr. Van Helsing--that I am the train fiend. At home in Exeter I
always used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to my
husband. I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of
the time-tables now. I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle
Dracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I
learned the times very carefully. Unhappily there are not many to learn,
as the only train to-morrow leaves as I say."

"Wonderful woman!" murmured the Professor.

"Can't we get a special?" asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook his
head: "I fear not. This land is very different from yours or mine; even
if we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our
regular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think.
Now let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the
tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. Do
you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him
letters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship
just as it was here. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice-Consul, and get
his aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way
smooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. John will stay
with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so if time be long you
may be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here
with Madam to make report."

"And I," said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she
had been for many a long day, "shall try to be of use in all ways, and
shall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is shifting
from me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!"
The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to
realise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to
each other, met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothing at the
time, however.

When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs.
Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of
Harker's journal at the Castle. She went away to get it; when the door
was shut upon her he said to me:--

"We mean the same! speak out!"

"There is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may
deceive us."

"Quite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?"

"No!" said I, "unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone."

"You are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tell
you something. And oh, my friend, I am taking a great--a terrible--risk;
but I believe it is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said those
words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. In
the trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her
mind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship
with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He learn
then that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with
eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box.
Now he make his most effort to escape us. At present he want her not.

"He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call;
but he cut her off--take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that
so she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man-brains that
have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will
come higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries,
that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and
therefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance!
She know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when
we want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great
brain which is trained like man's brain, but is of sweet woman and have
a special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away
altogether--though he think not so. Hush! let me speak, and you shall
learn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I never
feared before. We can only trust the good God. Silence! here she comes!"

I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics,
just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled
himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into
the room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly
forgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheets
of typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face
brightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and
thumb he said:--

"Friend John, to you with so much of experience already--and you, too,
dear Madam Mina, that are young--here is a lesson: do not fear ever to
think. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to
let him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to
where that half-thought come from and I find that he be no half-thought
at all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet
strong to use his little wings. Nay, like the "Ugly Duck" of my friend
Hans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought that
sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. See I
read here what Jonathan have written:--

"That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought
his forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he was
beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come
alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,
since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph."

"What does this tell us? Not much? no! The Count's child-thought see
nothing; therefore he speak so free. Your man-thought see nothing; my
man-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word
from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what
it mean--what it _might_ mean. Just as there are elements which rest,
yet when in nature's course they move on their way and they touch--then
pouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill
and destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and
leagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you ever
study the philosophy of crime? 'Yes' and 'No.' You, John, yes; for it is
a study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not--not
but once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not _a particulari ad
universale_. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant,
in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much
from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that _it is_. That is to
be empiric. The criminal always work at one crime--that is the true
criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.
This criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning and
resourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He be of
child-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime
also; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he
have done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not
by principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to
him the ground to start from to do more. '_Dos pou sto_,' said
Archimedes. 'Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!' To do once,
is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have
the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time,
just as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are
opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues," for
Mrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He went on:--

"Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see with
those so bright eyes." He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.
His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and
unconsciously, as she spoke:--

"The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso would
so classify him, and _qu_ criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind.
Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is a
clue, and the one page of it that we know--and that from his own
lips--tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a
'tight place,' he went back to his own country from the land he had
tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself
for a new effort. He came again better equipped for his work; and won.
So he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, and when all
hope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over
the sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube
from Turkey Land."

"Good, good! oh, you so clever lady!" said Van Helsing,
enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later he
said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room
consultation:--

"Seventy-two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope." Turning to
her again, he said with keen expectation:--

"But go on. Go on! there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid;
John and I know. I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.
Speak, without fear!"

"I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical."

"Nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think."

"Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small
and his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one
purpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube,
leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being
safe, careless of all. So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat
from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful
night. I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy! My soul
is freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me
is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for
his ends." The Professor stood up:--

"He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna,
whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to
Galatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us.
But his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in
God's Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for
his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter is taken
in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he think he
is free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so
many hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to
sleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind,
there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail! That
terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him
in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the
sun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his;
and this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your
suffering at his hands. This is now all the more precious that he know
it not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his
knowledge of our where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe
that God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark
hours. We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril
ourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a great
hour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribe
and write him all down, so that when the others return from their work
you can give it to them; then they shall know as we do."

And so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker
has written with her typewriter all since she brought the MS. to us.




CHAPTER XXVI

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


_29 October._--This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last
night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of us
had done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour,
and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and
for our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs.
Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and
more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually
necessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but
this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty
resolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:--

"I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a
steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hear
men's voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in
the rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.
There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged
along. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air
blowing upon me."

Here she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay
on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a
weight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.
Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst
Harker's hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. There
was a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak was
passing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. Suddenly she
sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:--

"Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!" We
could only make her happy, and so acquiesced. She bustled off to get
tea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:--

"You see, my friends. _He_ is close to land: he has left his
earth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie
hidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do
not touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be
in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did
at Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he
be carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men
may discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on
shore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.
We may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come
on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his
true self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered."

There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn;
at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.

Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her
response in her trance. The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming
than before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was
so short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole
soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made
reply:--

"All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as
of wood on wood." She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till
to-night.

And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of
expectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning;
but already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot
possibly get in till well after sun-up. Thus we shall have two more
hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throw
more light on what is happening.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time when
there was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a
station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.
Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than
this morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count's
sensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that
her imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance
hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goes
on it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count's power
over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be
a happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she did
speak, her words were enigmatical:--

"Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I can
hear, far off, confused sounds--as of men talking in strange tongues,
fierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves." She stopped and a
shudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds,
till, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, even
in answer to the Professor's imperative questioning. When she woke from
the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was
all alert. She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said;
when she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in
silence.

       *       *       *       *       *

_30 October, 7 a. m._--We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time
to write later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.
Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,
Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. They produced no
effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still
greater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The Professor
lost no time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:--

"All is dark. I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the
creaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There is another sound, a
queer one like----" She stopped and grew white, and whiter still.

"Go on; go on! Speak, I command you!" said Van Helsing in an agonised
voice. At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sun
was reddening even Mrs. Harker's pale face. She opened her eyes, and we
all started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost
unconcern:--

"Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can't? I don't remember
anything." Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said,
turning from one to the other with a troubled look:--

"What have I said? What have I done? I know nothing, only that I was
lying here, half asleep, and heard you say go on! speak, I command you!'
It seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad
child!"

"Oh, Madam Mina," he said, sadly, "it is proof, if proof be needed, of
how I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more
earnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I
am proud to obey!"

The whistles are sounding; we are nearing Galatz. We are on fire with
anxiety and eagerness.


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_30 October._--Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been
ordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, since
he does not speak any foreign language. The forces were distributed
much as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the
Vice-Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some
sort to the official, we being in extreme hurry. Jonathan and the two
doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival
of the _Czarina Catherine_.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away, and the
Vice-Consul sick; so the routine work has been attended to by a clerk.
He was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_30 October._--At nine o'clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called
on Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of
Hapgood. They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord
Godalming's telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility in
their power. They were more than kind and courteous, and took us at once
on board the _Czarina Catherine_, which lay at anchor out in the river
harbour. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his
voyage. He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a
run.

"Man!" he said, "but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should
have to pay for it wi' some rare piece o' ill luck, so as to keep up the
average. It's no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi' a wind
ahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin' on yer sail for his
ain purpose. An' a' the time we could no speer a thing. Gin we were nigh
a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi' us,
till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing could
we see. We ran by Gibraltar wi'oot bein' able to signal; an' till we
came to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we
never were within hail o' aught. At first I inclined to slack off sail
and beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if the
Deil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it
whether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our
miscredit wi' the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an' the Old Mon who
had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no
hinderin' him." This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition
and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:--

"Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and
he know when he meet his match!" The skipper was not displeased with the
compliment, and went on:--

"When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o' them,
the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had
been put on board by a queer lookin' old man just before we had started
frae London. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa
fingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye. Man! but the
supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboot
their business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I
felt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn't say it was
agin the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn't let up for
five days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to get
somewheres--well, he would fetch it up a'reet. An' if he didn't, well,
we'd keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and
deep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin' sun came
through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.
The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the
box and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi' them aboot it wi' a
handspike; an' when the last o' them rose off the deck wi' his head in
his hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the
property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the
river Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to
fling in, and as it was marked Galatz _via_ Varna, I thocht I'd let it
lie till we discharged in the port an' get rid o't althegither. We
didn't do much clearin' that day, an' had to remain the nicht at anchor;
but in the mornin', braw an' airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came
aboard wi' an order, written to him from England, to receive a box
marked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to
his hand. He had his papers a' reet, an' glad I was to be rid o' the
dam' thing, for I was beginnin' masel' to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil
did have any luggage aboord the ship, I'm thinkin' it was nane ither
than that same!"

"What was the name of the man who took it?" asked Dr. Van Helsing with
restrained eagerness.

"I'll be tellin' ye quick!" he answered, and, stepping down to his
cabin, produced a receipt signed "Immanuel Hildesheim." Burgen-strasse
16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; so
with thanks we came away.

We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi
Theatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were
pointed with specie--we doing the punctuation--and with a little
bargaining he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple but
important. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling
him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box
which would arrive at Galatz in the _Czarina Catherine_. This he was to
give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks
who traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his work by
an English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube
International Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to
the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all
he knew.

We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of his
neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had
gone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated by
his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house
together with the rent due, in English money. This had been between ten
and eleven o'clock last night. We were at a standstill again.

Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that
the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of
St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild
animal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the
women crying out "This is the work of a Slovak!" We hurried away lest we
should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.

As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were all
convinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where
that might be we would have to discover. With heavy hearts we came home
to the hotel to Mina.

When we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina
again into our confidence. Things are getting desperate, and it is at
least a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I was
released from my promise to her.


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_30 October, evening._--They were so tired and worn out and dispirited
that there was nothing to be done till they had some rest; so I asked
them all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything
up to the moment. I feel so grateful to the man who invented the
"Traveller's" typewriter, and to Mr. Morris for getting this one for
me. I should have felt quite; astray doing the work if I had to write
with a pen....

It is all done; poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered,
what must he be suffering now. He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to
breathe, and his whole body appears in collapse. His brows are knit; his
face is drawn with pain. Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I can
see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts. Oh!
if I could only help at all.... I shall do what I can.

I have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the papers that I
have not yet seen.... Whilst they are resting, I shall go over all
carefully, and perhaps I may arrive at some conclusion. I shall try to
follow the Professor's example, and think without prejudice on the facts
before me....

       *       *       *       *       *

I do believe that under God's providence I have made a discovery. I
shall get the maps and look over them....

       *       *       *       *       *

I am more than ever sure that I am right. My new conclusion is ready, so
I shall get our party together and read it. They can judge it; it is
well to be accurate, and every minute is precious.


_Mina Harker's Memorandum._

(Entered in her Journal.)

_Ground of inquiry._--Count Dracula's problem is to get back to his own
place.

(_a_) He must be _brought back_ by some one. This is evident; for had he
power to move himself as he wished he could go either as man, or wolf,
or bat, or in some other way. He evidently fears discovery or
interference, in the state of helplessness in which he must be--confined
as he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box.

(_b_) _How is he to be taken?_--Here a process of exclusions may help
us. By road, by rail, by water?

1. _By Road._--There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving the
city.

(_x_) There are people; and people are curious, and investigate. A hint,
a surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him.

(_y_) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass.

(_z_) His pursuers might follow. This is his highest fear; and in order
to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, even
his victim--me!

2. _By Rail._--There is no one in charge of the box. It would have to
take its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemies
on the track. True, he might escape at night; but what would he be, if
left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is not
what he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.

3. _By Water._--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most
danger in another. On the water he is powerless except at night; even
then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But were
he wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he would
indeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were
unfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would
still be desperate.

We know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to do
is to ascertain _what_ water.

The first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may,
then, get a light on what his later task is to be.

_Firstly._--We must differentiate between what he did in London as part
of his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had
to arrange as best he could.

_Secondly_ we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we
know of, what he has done here.

As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent
invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of
exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.
The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel
Hildesheim to clear and take away the box _before sunrise_. There is
also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but
there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to
Hildesheim.

That, so far, his plans were successful we know. The _Czarina Catherine_
made a phenomenally quick journey--so much so that Captain Donelson's
suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness
played the Count's game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind
through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the
Count's arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared
the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it--and here
we lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water,
moving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been
avoided.

Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival--_on
land_, at Galatz.

The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count could
appear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to
aid in the work? In my husband's diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing
with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man's
remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general
feeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation.

My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his
castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from
the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks
who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London.
Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this
service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he
came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to
arranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and
he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought,
by murdering his agent.

I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the
Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in
the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling
level with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then,
was on a river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars or
poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There
would be no such sound if floating down stream.

Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may
possibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more
easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza
which runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as
close to Dracula's castle as can be got by water.


_Mina Harker's Journal--continued._

When I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me. The
others kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said:--

"Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher. Her eyes have been where
we were blinded. Now we are on the track once again, and this time we
may succeed. Our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come on
him by day, on the water, our task will be over. He has a start, but he
is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carry
him may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw
him in the stream where he perish. This he knows, and will not. Now men,
to our Council of War; for, here and now, we must plan what each and all
shall do."

"I shall get a steam launch and follow him," said Lord Godalming.

"And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land," said Mr.
Morris.

"Good!" said the Professor, "both good. But neither must go alone. There
must be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak is strong and
rough, and he carries rude arms." All the men smiled, for amongst them
they carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris:--

"I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, and
there may be wolves. The Count, if you remember, took some other
precautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could
not quite hear or understand. We must be ready at all points." Dr.
Seward said:--

"I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunt
together, and we two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may come
along. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the
Slovaks, and a chance thrust--for I don't suppose these fellows carry
guns--would undo all our plans. There must be no chances, this time; we
shall, not rest until the Count's head and body have been separated, and
we are sure that he cannot re-incarnate." He looked at Jonathan as he
spoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear was
torn about in his mind. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then the
boat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ...
the ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was
silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:--

"Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because you
are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the
last; and again that it is your right to destroy him--that--which has
wrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; she
will be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are not so quick to run as
once; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to
fight with lethal weapons. But I can be of other service; I can fight in
other way. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men. Now let
me say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming and
friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and
whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be
landed, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy's
country. Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running
stream whence he cannot escape to land--where he dares not raise the lid
of his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to
perish--we shall go in the track where Jonathan went,--from Bistritz
over the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, Madam
Mina's hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way--all
dark and unknown otherwise--after the first sunrise when we are near
that fateful place. There is much to be done, and other places to be
made sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated." Here
Jonathan interrupted him hotly:--

"Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina,
in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil's illness, right
into the jaws of his death-trap? Not for the world! Not for Heaven or
Hell!" He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on:--

"Do you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful den of hellish
infamy--with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every
speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo?
Have you felt the Vampire's lips upon your throat?" Here he turned to
me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry:
"Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us!" and he sank
down on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor's voice, as he
spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed
us all:--

"Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful
place that I would go. God forbid that I should take her into that
place. There is work--wild work--to be done there, that her eyes may not
see. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with their own eyes what
is to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that we are in
terrible straits. If the Count escape us this time--and he is strong and
subtle and cunning--he may choose to sleep him for a century, and then
in time our dear one"--he took my hand--"would come to him to keep him
company, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You have
told us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as they
clutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them. You shudder; and
well may it be. Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is
necessary. My friend, is it not a dire need for the which I am giving,
possibly my life? If it were that any one went into that place to stay,
it is I who would have to go to keep them company."

"Do as you will," said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over, "we
are in the hands of God!"

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked.
How can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and
so brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money!
What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do
when basely used. I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and
that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing
to spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition could
not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within
another hour. It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each
of us was to do; and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam
launch, with steam up ready to start at a moment's notice. Dr. Seward
and Mr. Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed. We have
all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. Professor
Van Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train to-night for Veresti,
where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. We are
bringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and
horses. We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trust
in the matter. The Professor knows something of a great many languages,
so we shall get on all right. We have all got arms, even for me a
large-bore revolver; Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed like
the rest. Alas! I cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on my
forehead forbids that. Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling me
that I am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is getting
colder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go as
warnings.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--It took all my courage to say good-bye to my darling. We may
never meet again. Courage, Mina! the Professor is looking at you keenly;
his look is a warning. There must be no tears now--unless it may be that
God will let them fall in gladness.


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_October 30. Night._--I am writing this in the light from the furnace
door of the steam launch: Lord Godalming is firing up. He is an
experienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his
own on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding our
plans, we finally decided that Mina's guess was correct, and that if any
waterway was chosen for the Count's escape back to his Castle, the
Sereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one. We took
it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the
place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the
Carpathians. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at
night; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to
make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. Lord Godalming tells me to
sleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on
watch. But I cannot sleep--how can I with the terrible danger hanging
over my darling, and her going out into that awful place.... My only
comfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only for that faith it would
be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr.
Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started;
they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher
lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following
of its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead
their spare horses--four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. When
they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look
after the horses. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they
can mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a movable horn, and
can be easily adapted for Mina, if required.

It is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are rushing along through
the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike
us; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes
home. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into
a whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting the
furnace door....

       *       *       *       *       *

_31 October._--Still hurrying along. The day has come, and Godalming is
sleeping. I am on watch. The morning is bitterly cold; the furnace heat
is grateful, though we have heavy fur coats. As yet we have passed only
a few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of
anything like the size of the one we seek. The men were scared every
time we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and
prayed.

       *       *       *       *       *

_1 November, evening._--No news all day; we have found nothing of the
kind we seek. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrong
in our surmise our chance is gone. We have over-hauled every boat, big
and little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat,
and treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters,
so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a
Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we
have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every
deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose
to ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them,
going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. This
was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the
boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu
we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the
night. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell
upon me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that he
shall keep the first watch. God bless him for all his goodness to poor
dear Mina and me.

       *       *       *       *       *

_2 November, morning._--It is broad daylight. That good fellow would not
wake me. He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept peacefully and
was forgetting my trouble. It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept
so long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right. I am a new
man this morning; and, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can do
all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and
keeping watch. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to
me. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing. They should have got to
Veresti about noon on Wednesday. It would take them some time to get the
carriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, they
would be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide and help them! I am
afraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster! but we
cannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder how
Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endless
streams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them
are very large--at present, at all events, though they are terrible
doubtless in winter and when the snow melts--the horsemen may not have
met much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see
them; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be
necessary to take counsel together what to do next.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_2 November._--Three days on the road. No news, and no time to write it
if there had been, for every moment is precious. We have had only the
rest needful for the horses; but we are both bearing it wonderfully.
Those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful. We must push on;
we shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.

       *       *       *       *       *

_3 November._--We heard at Fundu that the launch had gone up the
Bistritza. I wish it wasn't so cold. There are signs of snow coming; and
if it falls heavy it will stop us. In such case we must get a sledge and
go on, Russian fashion.

       *       *       *       *       *

_4 November._--To-day we heard of the launch having been detained by an
accident when trying to force a way up the rapids. The Slovak boats get
up all right, by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge. Some went up
only a few hours before. Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and
evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again. Finally, they got
up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase
afresh. I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident; the
peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again, she kept
stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight. We must push
on harder than ever; our help may be wanted soon.


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_31 October._--Arrived at Veresti at noon. The Professor tells me that
this morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotise me at all, and that all I
could say was: "dark and quiet." He is off now buying a carriage and
horses. He says that he will later on try to buy additional horses, so
that we may be able to change them on the way. We have something more
than 70 miles before us. The country is lovely, and most interesting; if
only we were under different conditions, how delightful it would be to
see it all. If Jonathan and I were driving through it alone what a
pleasure it would be. To stop and see people, and learn something of
their life, and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour and
picturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the quaint
people! But, alas!--

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Dr. Van Helsing has returned. He has got the carriage and
horses; we are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour. The
landlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions; it seems enough
for a company of soldiers. The Professor encourages her, and whispers to
me that it may be a week before we can get any good food again. He has
been shopping too, and has sent home such a wonderful lot of fur coats
and wraps, and all sorts of warm things. There will not be any chance of
our being cold.

       *       *       *       *       *

We shall soon be off. I am afraid to think what may happen to us. We are
truly in the hands of God. He alone knows what may be, and I pray Him,
with all the strength of my sad and humble soul, that He will watch over
my beloved husband; that whatever may happen, Jonathan may know that I
loved him and honoured him more than I can say, and that my latest and
truest thought will be always for him.




CHAPTER XXVII

MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


_1 November._--All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed. The
horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go
willingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so many
changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to
think that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic;
he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well
to make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and
off we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable
kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full
of nice qualities. They are _very, very_ superstitious. In the first
house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my
forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to
keep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting an
extra amount of garlic into our food; and I can't abide garlic. Ever
since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have
escaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have no
driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresay
that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. The
Professor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though he
made me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and he
says that I answered as usual "darkness, lapping water and creaking
wood"; so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think of
Jonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. I write
this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. Dr.
Van Helsing is sleeping, Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and
grey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror's; even in his sleep
he is instinct with resolution. When we have well started I must make
him rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us,
and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be
needed.... All is ready; we are off shortly.

       *       *       *       *       *

_2 November, morning._--I was successful, and we took turns driving all
night; now the day is on us, bright though cold. There is a strange
heaviness in the air--I say heaviness for want of a better word; I mean
that it oppresses us both. It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep
us comfortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me; he says I answered
"darkness, creaking wood and roaring water," so the river is changing as
they ascend. I do hope that my darling will not run any chance of
danger--more than need be; but we are in God's hands.

       *       *       *       *       *

_2 November, night._--All day long driving. The country gets wilder as
we go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemed
so far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us
and tower in front. We both seem in good spirits; I think we make an
effort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr.
Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. The
houses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horse
we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. He
got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude
four-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no
trouble. We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can
drive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive
before. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn. Oh, what
will to-morrow bring to us? We go to seek the place where my poor
darling suffered so much. God grant that we may be guided aright, and
that He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both,
and who are in such deadly peril. As for me, I am not worthy in His
sight. Alas! I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may deign
to let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who have not incurred
His wrath.


_Memorandum by Abraham Van Helsing._

_4 November._--This to my old and true friend John Seward, M.D., of
Purfleet, London, in case I may not see him. It may explain. It is
morning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept
alive--Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold, cold; so cold that the grey
heavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all
winter as the ground is hardening to receive it. It seems to have
affected Madam Mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she was
not like herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usual
so alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost
her appetite. She make no entry into her little diary, she who write so
faithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well.
However, to-night she is more _vif_. Her long sleep all day have refresh
and restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset
I try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grown
less and less with each day, and to-night it fail me altogether. Well,
God's will be done--whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!

Now to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography, I
must, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go
unrecorded.

We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When I
saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism. We stopped our
carriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. I made a
couch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but
more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As
before, came the answer: "darkness and the swirling of water." Then she
woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass.
At this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new
guiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say:--

"This is the way."

"How know you it?" I ask.

"Of course I know it," she answer, and with a pause, add: "Have not my
Jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?"

At first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only one
such by-road. It is used but little, and very different from the coach
road from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and
more of use.

So we came down this road; when we meet other ways--not always were we
sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow
have fallen--the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, and
they go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathan
have note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long
hours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and
she succeed. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself to
suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I may
not wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm
her; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be
all-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel
guilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with the
reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. I
look down and find Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunset
time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood,
so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.
For we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though
it were the end of the world.

Then I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, and
then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep. But she sleep not, being as
though I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and
myself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down.
Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake,
and look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we
first enter the Count's house. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but she
is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear. I
light a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she
prepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter,
to feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready. I go
to help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already--that
she was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and I have
grave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. She
help me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the
fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget all
of watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying
quiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twice
more the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When I
wake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes
obedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and then
sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I have
to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have
harnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and she look
in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like it
not. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!--I am afraid of all things--even
to think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life and
death, or more than these, and we must not flinch.

       *       *       *       *       *

_5 November, morning._--Let me be accurate in everything, for though you
and I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first think
that I, Van Helsing, am mad--that the many horrors and the so long
strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain.

All yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and
moving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great,
frowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have held
sometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though I
did have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her--even for food. I
began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as
she is with that Vampire baptism. "Well," said I to myself, "if it be
that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at
night." As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and
imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked
with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still
sleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the frowning
mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a
steep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell
of in his diary. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill,
the end was near.

I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas!
unavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us--for
even after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and
all was for a time in a great twilight--I took out the horses and fed
them in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and near it I make
Madam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid
her rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that
she had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. But
I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with the
fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round
where Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and
I broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She sat still all the
time--so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the
snow was not more pale; and no word she said. But when I drew near, she
clung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to
feet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, when
she had grown more quiet:--

"Will you not come over to the fire?" for I wished to make a test of
what she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she
stopped, and stood as one stricken.

"Why not go on?" I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back, sat
down in her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked
from sleep, she said simply:--

"I cannot!" and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she
could not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be
danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!

Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I
came to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, they
whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a
time. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to
the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was
with quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was
about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying
sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of
some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the
snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with
trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses
whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to
fear--horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that
ring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of
the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and
all the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan's
horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist
began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy
glimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses
cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even
the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I
feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and
circled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when
I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held
me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low
it was:--

"No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!" I turned to her, and
looking in her eyes, said:--

"But you? It is for you that I fear!" whereat she laughed--a laugh, low
and unreal, and said:--

"Fear for _me_! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them
than I am," and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of
wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.
Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the
wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without
the Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till--if God have not
take away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes--there were before me
in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when
they would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the
bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous
lips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came
through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to
her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were
of the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--

"Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!" In fear I turned to my poor
Madam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the
terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my
heart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. I
seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the
Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and
laughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; for
I knew that we were safe within our protections. They could not
approach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within
the ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter. The
horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on
them softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poor
beasts no more of terror.

And so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the
snow-gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; but
when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again.
At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the
whirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away
towards the castle, and were lost.

Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending
to hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which I
could not wake her. I tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she made
no response, none at all; and the day broke. I fear yet to stir. I have
made my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead. To-day I have
much to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for there
may be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist
obscure it, will be to me a safety.

I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terrible
work. Madam Mina still sleeps; and, God be thanked! she is calm in her
sleep....


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_4 November, evening._--The accident to the launch has been a terrible
thing for us. Only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago;
and by now my dear Mina would have been free. I fear to think of her,
off on the wolds near that horrid place. We have got horses, and we
follow on the track. I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready. We
have our arms. The Szgany must look out if they mean fight. Oh, if only
Morris and Seward were with us. We must only hope! If I write no more
Good-bye, Mina! God bless and keep you.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_5 November._--With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashing
away from the river with their leiter-wagon. They surrounded it in a
cluster, and hurried along as though beset. The snow is falling lightly
and there is a strange excitement in the air. It may be our own
feelings, but the depression is strange. Far off I hear the howling of
wolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there are
dangers to all of us, and from all sides. The horses are nearly ready,
and we are soon off. We ride to death of some one. God alone knows who,
or where, or what, or when, or how it may be....


_Dr. Van Helsing's Memorandum._

_5 November, afternoon._--I am at least sane. Thank God for that mercy
at all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. When I left
Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle.
The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was
useful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty
hinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that
being entered I might not get out. Jonathan's bitter experience served
me here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I
knew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as if
there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either
there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves.
Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight.
The dilemma had me between his horns.

Her, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the
Vampire in that Holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf! I
resolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must
submit, if it were God's will. At any rate it was only death and
freedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had it but been for myself the
choice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than
the grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work.

I knew that there were at least three graves to find--graves that are
inhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in her
Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as
though I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time, when
such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine,
found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay,
and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the
wanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunset
come, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair
woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a
kiss--and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampire
fold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!...

There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence
of such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and
heavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such
as the lairs of the Count have had. Yes, I was moved--I, Van Helsing,
with all my purpose and with my motive for hate--I was moved to a
yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my
very soul. It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the
strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain it
was that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields
to a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a
long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound
of a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.

Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching
away tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared not
pause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should
begin to be enthrall; but I go on searching until, presently, I find in
a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister
which, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of
the mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so
exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls
some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl
with new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear Madam
Mina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought
further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I had
searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and as
there had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in the
night, I took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent.
There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and
nobly proportioned. On it was but one word

                                DRACULA.

This then was the Un-Dead home of the King-Vampire, to whom so many more
were due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew.
Before I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my
awful work, I laid in Dracula's tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished
him from it, Un-Dead, for ever.

Then began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it been but one, it
had been easy, comparative. But three! To begin twice more after I had
been through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet
Miss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived
through centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the
years; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....

Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by
thoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of
fear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, though
till all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen
the repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just
ere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been
won, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I could not have
endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of
writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and
left my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them
now and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death
for a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife
severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and
crumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come
centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud "I
am here!"

Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can
the Count enter there Un-Dead.

When I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from her
sleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much.

"Come!" she said, "come away from this awful place! Let us go to meet my
husband who is, I know, coming towards us." She was looking thin and
pale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. I was
glad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the
fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep.

And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet
our friends--and _him_--whom Madam Mina tell me that she _know_ are
coming to meet us.


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_6 November._--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I
took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did
not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take
heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being
left without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our
provisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we
could see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of
habitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy
walking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the
clear line of Dracula's castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under
the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the
Carpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur,
perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with
seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain
on any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We
could hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the
sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was
full of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about
that he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less
exposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we
could trace it through the drifted snow.

In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined
him. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock,
with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the
hand and drew me in: "See!" he said, "here you will be in shelter; and
if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one." He brought in our
furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and
forced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was
repulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could
not bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not
reproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top
of the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:--

"Look! Madam Mina, look! look!" I sprang up and stood beside him on the
rock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling
more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning
to blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the
snow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we
were it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the
white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in
kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far
off--in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came a
group of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a
long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog's tail
wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the
snow as they were, I could see from the men's clothes that they were
peasants or gypsies of some kind.

On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I
felt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and
well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned
there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all
pursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation,
however, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round
the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last
night. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--

"At least you shall be safe here from _him_!" He took the glasses from
me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.
"See," he said, "they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and
galloping as hard as they can." He paused and went on in a hollow
voice:--

"They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God's will be
done!" Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole
landscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his
glasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:--

"Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the
south. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snow
blots it all out!" I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Seward
and Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.
At the same time I _knew_ that Jonathan was not far off; looking around
I saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at
break-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took,
of course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party with
the cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy,
and, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he
laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the
opening of our shelter. "They are all converging," he said. "When the
time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides." I got out my revolver
ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came
louder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.
It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,
and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down
towards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could
see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger
numbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.

Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in
fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in
circling eddies. At times we could not see an arm's length before us;
but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to
clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of
late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew
with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the
sun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less
than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various
bodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer
and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly
had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts,
the snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each
party, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did
not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they
seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower
and lower on the mountain tops.

Closer and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind
our rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined
that they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our
presence.

All at once two voices shouted out to: "Halt!" One was my Jonathan's,
raised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris' strong resolute
tone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but
there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were
spoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming
and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the
other. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his
horse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his
companions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprang
forward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an
unmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van
Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.
Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew
up. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the
gypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held
himself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.

The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in
front, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hill
tops--and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.
For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses
and dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing
Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been
upon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild,
surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our
parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly
formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one
shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the
order.

In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring
of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was
evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun
should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the
levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor
the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their
attention. Jonathan's impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his
purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they
cowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the
cart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great
box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr.
Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of
Szgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,
with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had
seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and
they cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first
I thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang
beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that
with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was
spurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for
as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,
attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked
the other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the
lid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and
the top of the box was thrown back.

By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,
and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made
no resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the
shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count
lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from
the cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen
image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I
knew too well.

As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them
turned to triumph.

But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan's great knife.
I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same
moment Mr. Morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart.

It was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the
drawing of a breath, the whole body crumble into dust and passed from
our sight.

I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final
dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never
could have imagined might have rested there.

The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone
of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the
setting sun.

The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary
disappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as
if for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the
leiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves,
which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving
us alone.

Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his
hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I
flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the
two doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his
head on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand
in that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of
my heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said:--

"I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!" he cried
suddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, "It was
worth for this to die! Look! look!"

The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams
fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With one impulse
the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest "Amen" broke from all
as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying man
spoke:--

"Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is not
more stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!"

And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a
gallant gentleman.




                                  NOTE


Seven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of
some of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. It
is an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy's birthday is the same
day as that on which Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, the
secret belief that some of our brave friend's spirit has passed into
him. His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but
we call him Quincey.

In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went
over the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and
terrible memories. It was almost impossible to believe that the things
which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were
living truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. The
castle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.

When we got home we were talking of the old time--which we could all
look back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happily
married. I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since
our return so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all the
mass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one
authentic document; nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the later
note-books of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsing's memorandum.
We could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as
proofs of so wild a story. Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with
our boy on his knee:--

"We want no proofs; we ask none to believe us! This boy will some day
know what a brave and gallant woman his mother is. Already he knows her
sweetness and loving care; later on he will understand how some men so
loved her, that they did dare much for her sake."

                                THE END
